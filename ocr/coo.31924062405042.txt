PROFESSOR DENISON.
BY PROFESSOR M. L. D'OOQE.
Charles S. Denison was born at Gambier, Ohio, the site of Kenyon
College, July 12th, 1849. He is of old New England stock, being a
descendant in the eighth generation from Captain George Denison, of
Connecticut, who came to America in 1631.
His father,Rev. George Denison, a native of Vermont, was for three
years a student at Dartmouth, graduated at Kenyon in 1829, and after
taking a graduate course at Yale, became Professor of Mathematics
and Natural Philosophy at Kenyon, where he resided at the time of
the birth of his youngest child, who is the subject of this sketch. His
mother, Janette B. Ralston Denison, was born in New Hampshire, being
of Sootch descent.
Although born in Ohio, Mr. Denison passed only the early years of
childhood in that State, as in 1853 his father was called to the charge
of St. John's Church, Keokuk, Iowa. It was thought best, however, for
most of the family to spend the following winter at the old home in
Vermont. These early associations with the hills and groves of New
England left their impression on the mind of the boy.


The Technic.
In the spring of 1854 the family went to their new home in Iowa,
going by way of the lakes, Chicago and the Mississippi River. Keokuk
was at that time a typical Mississippi river town of the early days, with
no railroads, a very mixed population of blacks and whites, and an
occasional Indian, the daily landing place of great numbers of steam-
boats which plied up and down the river. Beautifully situated on the
bljffs of the Mississippi with a commanding view of the river, it was on
the whole an interesting if not romantic place.
Here Charles passed his boyhood, learned to swim, fish and shoot,
knew every steamboat on the river, got blown up with gun powder,
hated school, and belonged to a boys' military company, which fre-
quently met the enemy, in the form of another company, from a dis-
tant part of the city. These "engagements" usually took place at a
regularly constructed fort, with quite respectable earth-works laid out
and thrown up by the boys themselves
Amid all these boyish sports the future teacher of drawing and
engineering displayed a dominating interest in machinery and con-
struction. Well supplied with tools, he was obliged to make for him-
self the things which are usually bought for a boy's amusement, and
many miniature schooners, steamships, cars, locomotives, sleds, etc.,
were the result of this activity. At about the age of eight or ten years
a lively interest in Geology seized him, and one season was passed in
searching for and making a creditable collection of the fossils and
geodes of the region.
Upon the decease of his father in 1861 his mother returned with
the family to her former home in Lockport, New York. Here Charles
found abundant opportunity for the indulgence of his mechanical
tastes, in the manufacturing establishments there located, and in some
of the large machine shops most of his leisure time was spent.
This period of his life was marked by a deep interest in drawing,
mathematics and machinery. Sketching from nature was a pastime
which had special attractions, while algebra and geometry were the
favorite studies in school. But the steam-engine in its various forms
possessed for him an absorbing interest, which showed itself in the con-
struction of a small working steam-engine of the horizontal type, which
he completed at the age of thirteen. A year later lie made another,
and smaller engine into which he introduced an oscillating valve of his
own invention. At about this time the idea of a rotary steam-engine
came to him as an entirely new thought, and to this, as he supposed,
new discovery, he devoted a great deal of thought and hard work, until
he had invented and made models of two of the well-known types of
that form of engine. His hopes of fame and wealth were eventually
shattered by discovering cuts of the same forms in an old "Philosophy,"


11
and by ascertaining that he had been anticipated about a century by
Watt and Brama. This lesson in priority has proved of value to him since.
At the Lockport Union School, and at the private school of Dr.
James Ferguson, a ripe classical scholar and graduate of Edinburgh, he
was prepared for the classical collegiate course. But overwork and
neglect of exercise, were followed by their normal effects, resulting in
ill health and necessitating an absence for a time from school duties.
As a consequence, in 1865 he was sent west for a period of rest and tra-
vel, visiting his old home at Keokuk and travelling up and down the
Mississippi.
Keturning to Lockport he became interested in some suryeys that
were in progress in the neighborhood, and by this time realizing the
advantages of out-door life, he entered the office of S. F. Gooding, an
engineer of distinction in western New York, with the intention of
adopting civil engineering as a profession. The first survey of impor-
tance with which he was concerned was one undertaken by the U. S.
Government for a proposed ship canal to connect Lakes Erie and
Ontario by way of Lockport and the Erie Canal. A part of the season
of 1867 was spent in this work. Late in the summer he withdrew from
the party, in order to enter the old Military School of Norwich Univer-
sity at Northfield, Vermont. The change of climate and regular exer-
cise soon built up his health, and with new vigor he devoted himself
to the work of his class. Here he had the good fortune to be under the
instruction of Gen. Jackman in mathematics and Major Walker of toe
regular army in military science. In fencing he took daily exercise,
and he wrote out a manuscript treatise on the art, fully illustrated with
pen-and-ink drawings. He remained at Northfield but one year and
prepared himself to enter the sophomore class in the Engineering
course of the University of "Vermont at Burlington.
The years of residence and study at Burlington were profitable and
pleasant in many ways. The natural beauty of the place and its sit-
uations, the ever changing light and color on the lake and mountains,
was in itself an education, and the warm friendships there formed were
as lasting as they were helpful. Here he first met Mr. Angell, at that
time President of the University of Vermont, and here he enjoyed the
instruction of Professor Volney G. Barbour, an accomplished engineer
and graduate of Yale.
As the custom of long winter vacations was still in vogue, he spent
the winter of 1868-69 in teaching a district school in the town of Koyal-
ton, Vermont.
He took the degree of Bachelor of Science in 1870, and graduated
as a civil engineer in 1871 with the highest rank at that time ever taken
in the engineering course.


The'Technic.
In the following September Mr. Denison was appointed assistant
engineer on a corps of engineers charged with the work of locating and
constructing the Milwaukee and Northern Railroad. The winter fol-
lowing was exceptionally severe, and at the northern end of the line
the party endured much exposure and experienced many adventures
incident to such work. The out-door life and the wholesome and
generous hospitality of the thriving German farmers brought the
party through the winter in admirable condition. On this survey
he was under George H. Benzenburg, a graduate of the University of
Michigan, and an able engineer of Milwaukee.
In March, 1872, he received from Mr.Angell, who had since meeting
him in Vermont accepted the Presidency of the University of Michigan,
an invitation to accept an instructorship in engineering and drawing at
Ann Arbor. Mr. Denison entered upon his duties here in April of that
year, and has since that time remained connected with the University.
Early in the summer of 1873 he was appointed by the government
United States astronomer and surveyor for the special purpose of
establishing the boundary line between the territories of Washington
and Idaho. Early in July he proceeded to the initial station at Lewis-
ton, Idaho, at the intersection of the Snake and Clear "Water rivers.
After the careful astronomical establishment of the initial point, early
in August, with a party of sixteen men and forty horses laden with
instruments and supplies, the survey was carried directly northward,
with constantly increasing difficulties until latifude 49 degrees north
was reached, where the line was to have joined the international
boundary. No trace, however, of such a boundary was discovered, and
it was afterward found that owing to the rough and mountainous char-
acter of the country about twenty miles of the international boundary
at this point had been omitted. Late in October the party found them-'
selves sleeping in the snow, without tents and on short rations. Hav-
ing accomplished the object of the expedition they returned by Indian
trails through the mountains and over the prairies some two hundred
miles to Lewiston.
This expedition proved to be one of considerable adventure, and at
times of no small danger. It was prosecuted during the summer of the
"Modoc War " and an Indian uprising was a daily possibility. At one
time the entire outfit had to be driven through a line of forest fires in
order to avoid destruction by fire, and the danger of being snowed up
in the mountains was imminent as the end of October approached.
For two weeks the party lived on flour alone, with an occasional bird
brought down by a good shot.
The report of the survey was completed during the winter by Mr.
Rives, a former graduate of Ann Arbor, in company with Mr. Denison,
and duly accepted by the government at Washington.


13
In 1876 Mr. Denison was made instructor in Engineering and Draw-
ing and Assistant in Architecture. In 1882 he was made Assistant Pro-
fessor, and three years later he was appointed to his present chair of
Descriptive Geometry, Stereotomy and Drawing. In 1888 he spent sev
eral months in Europe, where he studied models of European Engi-
neering and methods of technical education.
Professor Denison has won an enviable reputation as a teacher.
His good taste and fine feeling for all that is artistic are unquestioned.
To the growth of the Department of Civil Engineering Professor Deni-
son has contributed his full share by his devotion and skill as an
instructor. He has found time to write but little for publication, but
he has read a number of papers at meetings of Engineering and Art
societies, and has done his part in gratuitous lecturing before clubs and
societies. He has been invited to prepare an important paper for the
International Engineering Congress to be held in Chicago, next August.
Mr. Denison has for many years held offices of trust and responsibility
in the vestry of St. Andrews Episcopal Church. Mr. Denison's spright-
liness and youthful appearance have given occasion to many witti-
cisms, and his quickness at repartee is proverbial. That the bachelor
has not long ago become a benedict is a riddle to his numerous friends
and admirers.


The Technic.
VARIATION OF LATITUDE.
The ordinary work of an engineer does not usually require him to
take account of forces producing minute effects or of quantities which
are extremely small. Such forces and quantities are generally neg-
ligible when their magnitudes are small as compared with the uncer-
tainties in the magnitudes of the other forces and quantities with
which they are to be compared. In engineering structures the qual-
ities of the materials employed and the friction of stationary and mov-
ing parts are ordinarily sources of quantities which are variable
between wide limits and more or less indeterminate in their amounts.
When this is the case, it is quite unnecessary to use a rigorous theoret-
ical treatment or a refined practical application, so far as these uncer-
tainties are concerned. But all of the engineer's work is not of this
character. Some of it requires rigorous treatment in theory and prac-
tice. When such is the case it is necessary to know and take account
of all the influences which measurably affect the accuracy of the
results. Numerous examples illustrating this might be cited. It is pro-
per to mention here some of those belonging in common to the engi-
neer and to the astronomer. It is so in geodetic work and in the deter-
minations of meridians and important boundaries. These require a
very high grade of engineering work combined with an equally high
grade of astronomical work. In these cases the astronomical part con-
sists largely in determining azimuths, longitudes and latitudes as
accurately as possible. Each of these presents singularities peculiar to
itself and in the case of latitude the chief singularities relate to its
variation. In the following paragraphs this subject will be briefly con-
sidered.
Before considering the phenomenon of the variation of latitude, as
it appears from observation, it will be well to give, even at the risk of
being somewhat technical, a few of the results which follow from the
dynamical principles involved in the case of rotating bodies and then to
see what the applications of these results are in the case of the earth. For
the present it will be assumed that the rotating body is perfectly rigid.
For any point of a rigid body there are three principal axes and
three principal moments of inertia corresponding to them. A body
rotating about a principal axis will preserve that axis as a permanent


15
axis of rotation so long as the body is subject to the action of no dis-
turbing force. A disturbing force will, however, change the position of
the axis of rotation of the body. The amount of change will depend
upon the degree of stability of the principal axis and upon the mag-
nitude of the disturbing force. In case the rotation is stable, a small
force will, at most, only cause a small deviation of the axis of rotation
from a fixed straight line known as the invariable line. If, however, a
small force eventually produces a very great change in the rotation, it
is unstable. So far as has been, and, probably, can be determined, the
rotation of the earth is stable, and the actual deviation of the axis of
rotation from the invariable line is very slight indeed. Still it is large
enough to have a measurable influence on the results of astronomical
observation and as it is one of the chief causes of the periodic variation
of latitude, we will proceed further with the results obtained from
dynamical considerations.
When the rotation of a rigid body does not take place about a
principal axis, the axis of rotation does not remain fixed in the body,
but continually changes its position, even though the rotation is not
disturbed by the action of any extraneous force. The line through the
body coincident with the axis of rotation at any instant is at that
instant the instantaneous axis of rotation. The movement of the
instantaneous axis of rotation can in some cases be determined. The
case of interest to us is that in which two of the principal moments of
inertia about the center of gravity are equal and each nearly the same
as the third one, and in which the axis of rotation is nearly though not
quite in coincidence with the unequal principal axis. And for our case
we may further assume that the rotation is not disturbed by the action
of any extraneous force. Under these conditions the invariable line
and the instantaneous axis of rotation both move with reference to the
body. They describe in it co-axiai right cones, the common axis of
which is the axis of unequal moment of the body. But the invariable
line is fixed in space and consequently the axis of unequal moment
really describes in space a right cone about it, and so also does the in-
stantaneous axis of rotation. The semi-angles of the cones described
about the axis of unequal moment by the invariable line and the
instantaneous axis are connected with each other and with the prin-
cipal moments of inertia by a very simple relation, from which, in the
case of the earth, it can be shown that these semi-angles are very
nearly equal. The relation is
B tan a = A tan ft,
where a and /? are respectively the angles made by the invariable line
and the instantaneous axis of rotation with the axis of unequal
moment and B the unequal and A one of the equal moments of iner-


The Technic.
tia. Then a and P are the semi-angles of the co-axial cones and their
difference the semi-angle of the cone described by the instantaneous
axis about the invariable line.
The earth is not exactly a spheroid of revolution, but it is so nearly
so that this assumption will not lead to appreciable error. It is not a
thoroughly rigid body, but in order to apply the above results it will,
for the moment be regarded as such. These conditions give two equal
principal moments of inertia. Moreover, the rotation as assumed
above is very approximately satisfied by it. The attractions of the sun,
moon and planets do not act, as might at first be supposed, as forces
disturbing that part of the motion now under consideration. Hence
they do not invalidate the results given. They produce precession and
nutation and although the effect now being considered is known as the
Eulerian nutation, it really comes about by making an abstraction of
the disturbing forces and regarding the earth as simply set in rotation
and left to itself. It is that part of the motion, analytically considered,
which is derived from the complementary functions arising in the
integration of the differential equations obtained in taking account of
the action of the sun aDd moon in disturbing the rotation of the earth.
To obtain these complementary functions certain terms must be placed
equal to zero, and this happens to be equivalent to making an abstrac-
tion of all extraneous forces. According to theory, then, the instan-
taneous axis of rotation and the invariable line describe co-axial right
cones in the earth, of which the common axis is the axis of figure.
And the rotation axis describes a right cone in space about the inva-
riable line as an axis. Theory further shows that the axis of rotation
will revolve about that of figure from west to east and in a period of
sin [)
sin (a — p)
days. In order io determine this theoretical period, a and must be
known, or, at least, since they are small and nearly equal, the ratio of
either to their difference must be known. It can be shown, still assum-
ing the earth to be perfectly rigid, that this ratio can not exceed 306
times either and that this is its approximate value. Hence, the the-
oretical period is about 306 days or about ten months. This is often
referred to as " Euler's ten-month period."
Such, in short and in part, is the theory of the rotation of the earth
as accepted until recently. But theory is not always correct and
that it has not been so in this case has been demonstrated by Dr.
Chandler in his recent important researches on the variation of lat-
itude. And Professor Newcomb has pointed out a defect in the theory:
it is in not taking account of the want of rigidity of the earth and in


17
wholly neglecting the fluidity of the oceans which surround it. These
are important elements. Their effect is to lengthen the theoretical
period of the revolution of the axis of rotation about that of figure.
Thus, by assuming the earth to be homogeneous and to have a rigidity
equal to that of steel, a period of 441 days is obtained instead of 306 as
required by a perfectly rigid earth.
Latitude, as found by observation, is the complement of the angle
included between a vertical line through the place of observation and
the instantaneous axis. The vertical line is determined by the direc-
tion of gravity which may be assumed to be constant so long as the
form of the earth and the distribution of the materials composing it
remain the same. From this it is evident that there will be a variation
of latitude if the axis of rotation is not a fixed line in the earth and
that this variation will be periodic if the axis of rotation revolves reg-
ularly about that of figure. And it is further evident that the ampli-
tude of variation will depend upon the angular separation of the two
axes and that the phases of variation will progressively move around
the earth. Places differing in longitude will, at any given time, exhibit
different phases.
It has long been known that if such periodic variations exist and
are of measurable^nagnitudes, they will afford the means of determin-
ing the position of the axis of rotation with reference to that of figure.
Analytically considered, this requires, simply, the determination of the
values of two constants of integration. By means of data furnished by ob-
servation attempts were made some years ago to find the values of these
constants with the result that both seemed to be zero, which would indicate
a coincidence of the two axes. But such is not the case. Dr. Chandler
has recently shown that there is a revolution of the axis of rotation from
the west to the east in a period of 427 days and that the semi-amplitude of
the variation of latitude due to it is about 0."12. He has also shown
that there is another periodic variation, which will be spoken of later on.
That this periodic variation was not previously detected by those
who attempted to discover it, Peters, Nyren and others, is probably due
to their too strict adherence to theory and to the 306-day period which
it indicates. In cases like this where the quantities in question are
small q,nd likely to be confused with instrumental and other errors of
observation, it cannot be expected that the solution of equations of con-
dition will give results of a confirmatory character unless the assump-
tions which are involved in their formation approximate closely to
the truth. Naturally, then, the use of a period of 306, instead of the
true one of 427 days, would lead to inconclusive results. Dr. Chand-
ler's success, aside from the vast amount of pains-taking labor which it
has required, is due to his having perceived the inadequacy of existing
i


The Technic.
theory to account for the observed phenomenon and to his skill in
treating a difficult problem by strictly inductive methods. He tells us
that he "deliberately put aside the teachings of theory, because it
seemed high time that the facts should be examined by a purely induc-
tive process; that the nugatory results of all attempts to detect the
existence of the Eulerian period probably arose from a defect of the
theory itself; and that the entangled condition of the whole subject
should be examined afresh by processes unfettered by any precon-
ceived notions whatever" And the problem which he proposed to
himself was "To see whether it would not be possible to lay the num-
erous ghosts—in the shape of various discordant residual phenomena
pertaining to the determination of aberration, parallaxes, latitudes, and
the like —which had heretofore flitted elusively about the astronomy of
precision, during the century ; or to reduce them to a tangible form, by
some simple, consistent hypothesis. It was thought that if this could
be done, a study of the nature of the forces, as thus indicated, by which
the earth's rotation is influenced, might lead to a physical explanation
of them."
In the course of his investigations, he has searched astronomical
records for data bearing on the question and in doing so he has relied
not merely on recent observations but has gone a* far back as the
time when Bradley was using his sextant, at Wanstead in 1726. For
somewhat more than a hundred years from the beginning of this
period, the observations did not form a continuous series, so that it has
not been possible, so far, to trace satisfactorily the course of the vari-
ations of latitude which they plainly exhibit. But for the last fifty
years the series is fairly continuous and this has enabled results of
great importance to be obtained. These will be given, but before doing
so it may be well to state that they have been obtained through a dis-
cussion of some thirty-three thousand observations, one-third of which
were made in the southern hemisphere. Seventeen different observa-
tories participated in making these observations, and four of these
observatories belong to the southern 'hemisphere. In making them
twenty-one different instruments and nine different methods of obser-
vation have been used.
The first result obtained has already been mentioned, the revolu-
tion of the axis of rotation about that of figure in 427 days. This pro-
duces a periodic variation of latitude having, as was finally determined,
a semi-amplitude of 0."12. By a consideration of the results obtained
at widely separated observatories it was shown that this variation was
neither instrumental nor local, but terrestrial, and it lead at once to
Professor Newcomb's modification of the theory of the earth's rotation.
For a time, during the progress of the investigation, it seemed probable


19
that this variation was subject to a considerable variation both in period
and amplitude. But this is not the case. By a rearrangement of the
data, the true character of the variations were disclosed and it was seen
that this apparent variation is due to the superposition of another peri-
odic variation. The latter has an annual period with its minimum and
maximum values just before the vernal and autumnal equinoxes
respectively and its zeros just before the solstices. In amount its varU
ation is not constant, but ranges from 0/'04 to 0."20. The cause of this
variation has not yet been ascertained so that it is not possible to pre-
dict with certainty the effects which it may produce in the future.
Its variations during the past fifty years are known in a general way.
The minimum value of its range was reached some time between 1860
and 1880 and its larger value has prevailed before and since these
dates.
The resultant variation of latitude due to these two causes is, of
course, their sum. When they are at opposite phases, it may nearly
disappear and when they are at the same phase and tne annual term at
its maximum, it may amount to nearly two-thirds of a second.
A rigorous formula representing the variations can not be given
until the cause of the annual variation and its laws have been ascer-
tained. Dr. Chandler has given a provisional formula, for the longi-
tude of Greenwich, which closely represents the variations of the past
fifty years, and it is probable that it will approximately represent them
for a few years to come. In his formula the first term takes account of
the variations due to the 427-day period and the second term that due
to the annual period. His formula, after making a slight change in it
so as to make it applicable at a place whose longitude is A, is
&lt;h- &lt;?o = — 0"12 cos [ 1 + 0.°835 (&lt; — T)] — n cos (0 + 10°)
where Tand r2 are computed by means of
T= 2406193 + 431 E,
r2 = 0/'047 + 0/'003 r + 0." 00025 r*
and where the meanings of the symbols are as follows: &lt;p and 0O are
the instantaneous and mean latitudes of the place; T, the date at
which the north pole of the earth's figure passes the meridian of Green-
wich; t, the date of observation; r, the interval in years, positive after
1875; E, the number of completed revolutions between the date t and
the adopted epoch 1875 IJov. 1; and 0 the longitude of the sun.
The interval (t — T) is to be expressed in days. The first member
o — 0o symbolizes the variation of latitude at the time t. 1875 Kov. 1 is the
2406193rd day since the commencement of the Julian Period. This
accounts for that number, it being the adopted epoch of the formula.
A somewhat simpler formula gives a considerably closer representation


The Technic.
of the observations from 1862 to 1882. It is, for the meridian of Green-
wich.
9 — 90 = — 0/'12o cos [0.°843 (t — 2406191)] — 0."050 cos (0 +10°)
in which t is the number of days since the beginning of the Julian
Period.
From the smallness of these variations it will be seen that the cor-
rections to the latitude which they give will seldom need to be con-
sidered. It is only in the most accurate work that their being neglected
will have any appreciable influence. As has been stated above, the
problem of the variation of latitude is not yet fully solved. The cause
of the annual term is yet unexplained. The question of the secular
variation of latitude has been raised but its existence has not yet been
established and even if it is it is not likely to have any very sensible
influence upon the results either of the engineer or of the astronomer.
From an astronomical point of view, the variation of latitude is impor-
tant not in itself alone but also on account of the influence it has in
vitiating the results of the astronomy of precision. It affects almost all
kinds of absolute measurements. Equator point, equinoctical point,
obliquity of the ecliptic, constant of aberration, stellar parallaxes," and
absolute right ascensions and. declinations of stars, may be mentioned
as examples. And when the systematic errors introduced by it are
eliminated a conclusion is reached which is most gratifying to astrono-
mers. It is that the degree of precision already attained in astronom-
ical observation is far greater than had hitherto been supposed.

THE METALLURGY OF ALUMINUM.
BY JOHN W. LANQLEY PH. D.
The metal aluminum has been known to chemists for fifty years
and its physical properties of lightness, strength, sonorousness and
very slight corrodibility by atmospheric agencies have long held out
exceedingly attractive prospects of what would happen when it could
be produced on a large scale. The problem of the industrial manufac-
ture of aluminum has, therefore, attracted the attention of some of the
ablest chemists and metallurgists which the world has known.
First among them in point of time stands StClaire Deville, who
indicated as early as 1860 a method which was subsequently followed
industrially and, indeed, formed the basis of all successful attempts
until four years ago.
Deville's process consisted of three stages.
1st. Producing pure aluminum oxide (alumina) from clay or
bauxite by chemical means.
2nd. Passing chlorine over a red hot mixture of alumina and car-
bon which yielded the volatile and very deliquescent chloride of alum-
inum
Ah CU
3rd. Heating aluminum chloride with metallic sodium. This
yielding metallic aluminum and sodium chloride, according to the
equatum.
Ah Cle + 6 Na = 2 Al + 6 Na CI
This process was carried out industrially for over twenty years at
Salindres, France, where was the only manufacture of aluminum on a
commercial scale in the world: The price of the metal during this time
ranged from $20.00 to $12.00 per pound.
The chemical reactions given in stages 2 and 3 were very expensive
and wasteful. In No. 2 only a portion of the alumina was converted
into chloride, which latter was liable to be contaminated with iron
chlorides from tne apparatus. Moreover the aluminum chloride is a
substance difficult to handle and to preserve.
In No. 3 there was a violent reaction resulting in the loss by vola-
tilization of some of the sodium and also of the chloride. So that on
the average less than half of the aluminum in the oxide was recovered
as metal.


Minor improvements were made. A double chloride of aluminum
and sodium was substituted for aluminum chloride, and methods were
found for removing most of the iron from the double salt.
It was found that cryolite could be substituted in part for the arti-
ficial chloride, so that the losses were reduced and the metal made
purer.
In 1888-89 Mr. H. Y. Castner, an American inventor, discovered a
method by which sodium could be produced at a much cheaper rate
than had hitherto prevailed, and in 1889-90 large works were erected in
England for manufacturing aluminum from Castner's cheap sodium.
This company began putting aluminum on the market at prices rang-
ing from 87.00 to $5.00.
A further improvement in the direction of cheapness was made by
Netto at Newcastle, England, in 1890.
He dispensed entirely with the costly aluminum chloride, substi-
tuting therefor a mixture of cryolite and anhydrous sodium chloride-
This process, however, would not yield a pure metal from native cry-
olite, and an artificial cryolite had to be substituted, which, of course,
increased the expense and made it about equal to the DeVille method.
During the period from 1860 to 1890 various attempts to produce
aluminum by other means than metallic sodium were suggested, but
they all proved abortive with the single exception of those depending
on the use of electricity.
DeVille had indicated a theoretical method, which he appears to
have tried on a laboratory scale by passing an electric current through
fused aluminum chloride mixed with common salt. Several inventors
took out patents which were simple appropriations of DeVille's ideas,
but none of them attained any industrial success, because the yield of
the metal was very small, and the losses, owing to the escape of the
chlorine and to secondary reactions in the bath, were great.
It was next proposed to electrolyse cryolite, but it failed from the
above reasons and also because the aluminum produced was impure.
Attempts were also made to form aluminum fluoride from a mixture
of alumina and carbon by help of an electric current, but they did not
succeed, chiefly because, since carbon is not attacked by fluorine, the
former made a mechanical protection to the alumina, which failed to
combine with the fluorine or to be dissolved.
Sir William Siemens has patented an electric furnace, consisting
of a carbon anode wich could be lowered into a carbon crucible, the
latter being the cathode. An electric arc could be sprung between the
two, and by it any contained metal or salt would be fused and imper-
fectly electrotysed.


23
Later this idea was taken up by the Messrs. Cowles, of Cleveland,in
their well-known f urnace,but it was found that owing to the excessively
high temperature the alumina was first melted and then partially
volatilized, distributing the reduced metallic aluminum in the condi-
tion of minute globules throughout the contents of the furnace with
which the reduced aluminum alloyed, forming a bronze when copper
was present.
The Cowles method yielded industrially aluminum bronze and
alloys of aluminum and iron, but not the pure metal itself. A some-
what similar process was devised by Heroult in France. This was an
even closer imitation than the Cowles had made. It, too, was an arc
furnace and yielded alloys of aluminum only.
Between the years 1885 and 1889 Mr. Chas. M. Hall invented an
electrotytic method for the reduction of aluminum, which works very
successfully and has been put into practice on a large scale by the
Pittsburgh Reduction Co. at New Kensington, Pennsylvania.
The principles on which this invention rests are wholly new in the
aluminum industry; experience appears to show them to be fundamen-
tal, and such as must dominate,.any electrolytic process capable of
working with commercial economy. In order to understand the nature
of the problem which Hall has solved, it is necessary to recall some
peculiarities of aluminum which mark it off so distinctly from the ordi-
nary metals of commerce.
Aluminum melts at about 760° centigrade. Its specific gravity in
the cast state is 2.67. It oxidizes with extreme slowness at any tem-
perature below a white heat and is practically non volatile at a heat
less than that of the electric arc.
Chemically, it is characterized by exceedingly strong attractions for
silicon, fluorine, and chlorine, while for sulphur its attraction is very
feeble. For oxygen the metal in mass shows an apparent indifference,
but when once the oxide is formed, it requires a large expenditure of
energy to separate it. So that its attraction for oxygen is stronger than
that of carbon for oxygen, hence alumina cannot be reduced by carbon
like the oxides of iron or copper.
The union of silicon with aluminum is an especially strong one. So
powerful is the attraction between them, that aluminum melted in con-
tact with glass or any fusible silicate, will reduce it and form silicide of
aluminum, the metalloid existing in the alloy chiefly as graphitoidal
silicon. There is no method known for purifying it from silicon, while
keeping the aluminum metallic and as even three-tenths of one per
cent, of this element have a most prejudicial effect on the physical
properties of aluminum, the only method to be followed is to rigidly
exclude silicates in every form from the materials and the furnace in
which the reduction of this metal is taking place.


The Technic.
Experiment has proved that fluorine is in general a more energetic
element than oxygen, and that the decomposition of the fluorides
requires more electrical energy than the oxides, but alumina is a non-
conductor, and if it is dissolved as a salt in water, then the current
spends itself on the water, breaking it up into oxygen and hydrogen,
but the aluminum salt is not decomposed. What was necessary, then,
was to find some solvent of aluminum which should at the same time
be electrically more stable than alumina, so that the energy of the cur-
rent could be expended on the oxide and not on the fluoride.
Now fluoride of aluminum is infusible: fluoride of sodium is f ijsi-
ble but will not, when melted, dissolve alumina, but Hall discovered
that a double fluoride of aluminum and sodium would melt at a little
above a red heat and possessed the property of dissolving alumina in
large quantities. Here, then, the requisite conditions for successful
electrolysis were found. The double salt when fused being the solvent
and alumina the dissolved body; the latter only, breaking up under the
action of the current, if its electromotive force is not permitted to
become too great.
The practical method of carrying out Hall's process is as follows:
Rectangular tanks of boiler plate about 4/x3/xl/ are lined on the sides
and bottom with compressed carbon. Above this, extending longitu-
dinally, are two copper arms, 6//xJ^//, in cross section from which
depend copper rods three-eights of an inch in diameter; these rods are
attached at the upper end by movable clamps to the copper arms,
while at their lower end they are fastened to carbon cylinders three
inches in diameter by twelve long. All of these rods are made electri-
cally positive, while the iron pot and carbon lining are negative.
Over the bottom of the pot is sprinkled a mixture of aluminum and
sodium fluorides, or native cryolite may be used. Al% Fe Na6 Fe.
One or more of the carbon rods are now brought into contact with
the carbon lining, forming numerous short arcs, the heat from these,
and also that due to the contact resistance of the electrodes, melts por-
tions of the cryolite, resulting after a few hours in a shallow bath of
fused salt. More cryolite is now added together with some alumina,
and the electrodes are diawn slightly apart.
This obliges the current to pass through the fluid portion of the
circuit with accompanying electrolysis ana decomposition of the
dissolved alumina. At the end of seventy-two hours the bath is com-
pletely formed, being about six inches deep.
The regular course of the reduction now ensues, alumina in a
powdered condition is sprinkled over the top of the bath and stirred
down into it by a carbon or iron rod. The metal is regularly reduced


25
and settles to the bottom of the bath in a fluid condition. This is
derived, apparently, exclusively from the alumina, none of the fluori-
des suffering decomposition unless the heat is allowed to become too
high. The oxygen of the aluminum goes to the positive pole, where it
enters into union with the carbon of the anode and escapes as carbon
monoxide or dioxide.
The theoretical equation being,
Ah o, + 3 C = 2 Al + 3 C o
This appears to indicate a chemical reduction, but it is only indi-
rectly so, for if the anodes are made of copper the aluminum is still
formed, while free oxygen escapes from the anode.
The carbon anodes burn off slowly at the lower ends, where they
are under the surface of the bath, but this wasting is only slightly in
excess of that due to the oxygen derived from the electrolysis.
Native cryolite always contains silica, iron, phosphorus, and other
impurities, which are reduced in the electrolysis. The first portions of
the aluminum is contaminated by these, but after the first day or two
they are wholly removed from the bath, and the quality of the metal
henceforth produced depends only on the purity of the alumina
used.
The process is a continuous one and succeeds best when followed
without interruption day or night for months in succession. The alum
inum being removed periodically by ladling. No sensible wear and
tear occurs to the carbon lining of the pot, except by its infiltration,
with melted fluorides, which, after several months, render it advisable
to put in a new lining.
The electrical expenditures are from 5000 to 7000 amperes, which
go through all the pots in series, with a drop of potential of seven volts
for each pot. The actual E. M. F. of decomposition of alumina is
about 2.30 volts, the difference between this and the seven volts neces-
sary being due to internal resistance of the bath and the carbon
linings.
The production of one pound of aluminum takes eighteen horse-
power hours, measured at the steam engine. The other principal items
of expense are for alumina, labor and carbon anodes. The great
industrial advance made by this invention is shown by the great fall of
the price of aluminum, which has fluctuated considerably but averages
about 70 cts per pound for the last twelve months. The improvement
in the quality of the metal has also been great, for silicon, that foe to
all the other processes, is wholly excluded from the carbon linings, and


The Technic.
is practically eliminated from the fluorides after a few days' use, leav-
ing as its only avenue of admission the alumina-used, but this can now
be made nearly chemically pure, even on a manufacturing scale.
Commercial aluminum is now regularly made 99.3 fine.
The demand for the metal is rapidly increasing and exceeds the
supply. The latter is about 1500 pounds daily.

THE TREATMENT OF LAKE SUPERIOR COPPER ORES.
Of the rich counties of the State of Michigan, Houghton stands sec-
ond only to Wayne in the amount of its taxable property. The value
of the property in this county lies in its large deposits of native copper,
and in the mining plants, concentrating mills and smelting works
incident to the extraction and refining of this metal.
The amount of copper produced by this one county in 1892 was
about one-fourth of that produced by the entire United States. The
yearly product is not increasing rapidly, and of the total output of the
United States, the proportion produced by Houghton County is grad-
ually diminishing.
The quality of " Lake Copper," by which name it is known in com-
merce, is such that it is peculiarly applicable to electrical purposes;
and owing to this peculiarity, the limited supply, and the great demand
for metal for these purposes, the Lake Copper is always worth about
one cent per pound more than other brands.
The copper of Northern Michigan is found in beds of amygdaloid
or conglomerate, varying in thickness from two to twenty feet. These
lie between beds of trap, which are also of varying thickness. At
Houghton, which is on the copper-bearing formation, the beds have a
dip of about 55° ; their outcrop is about two miles wide, and extends
from Keweenaw Point south-west into Wisconsin.
The metal sought for in the early days of copper mining was in the
form of mass copper, but the known deposits of this form have been
almost exhausted, only a small percentage of the metal coming to the
smelters in that form. In most of the deposits worked at the present
time the copper occurs as small grains of the native metal, varying in
size from that of a pin head to that of a bean; and to some extent, in
the form of threads and thin sheets. In some of the conglomerate beds
the cementing material has been replaced by copper ; and in a few of
the amygdaloid beds masses of copper are found, varying in size from
small grains to one and even five tons.
How copper came to be deposited in these beds, is a question that
has puzzled many geologists; sufficient for our treatment of the subject
is it to say, that the copper is purer than can be obtained by refining
any of its ores. Two samples analyzed at the Michigan Mining School
showed 99.96% of metallic copper.

The only elements occurring with the copper that deteriorate its
quality, and that cannot be separated by washing, are arsenic, sulphur
and silver. Arsenic is of rare occurrence, and when present exists as
one of the arsenides of copper. Sulphur is also of very rare occur-
rence, the sulphide of copper occurring in but one of the mines that is-
now worked. Silver occurs as metallic silver deposited as small masses
or crystals upon the copper ; the latter impurity, for as such it must be
regarded, is found in almost all of the beds to a greater or less extent.
Silver can be separated from copper very completely by hand picking,
and this is done upon all of the coarser products at several of the mills.
The objection to the presence of silver lies in the fact, that it increases
the electrical resistance of wires containing a very small percentage of
it, notwithstanding the fact that silver is a better conductor than
copper.
The amount of copper in the various amygdaloid and conglomer-
ate beds will run from nothing up to three or four per cent., seldom
running higher than the latter figure except where masses are found.
The poorest ore worked is that of the Atlantic Mine; here the ore has
not run above.8 percent, in metallic copper for several years, and yet the
mine has been worked at a profit. During the year 1892, 297,030 tons of
ore were treated by the Atlantic Stamp Mill, yielding an average of 12.3
lbs. of copper per ton of ore. The cost of stamping and separating one
ton of rock was only 25 cents. As the mill of the Atlantic Mine has
one of the best records of any mill on Lake Superior, a short descrip-
tion of the operation of concentration at this place will be given.
The mine is worked with four inclined shafts sunk in the deposit,
thus bringing the shaft houses inline with each other. As the skip*
come to the surface,. they are raised about 35 feet above the ground
level, and dumped into ore bins provided at each shaft house. From
these bins the ore is loaded, through chutes, into tram cars, and these
are conveyed over an elevated, endless-rope tramway terminating at
the rock house, some forty feet above the ground level, where the ore
is automatically dumped over " grizzlies," from which it falls to the
upper floor of the rock house. The "grizzlies" are made up of
parallel 4" planks, faced with iron. The planks are placed on edge,
and lie at an angle of about 459.
The rock passing through the grizzlies falls upon a second screen
made up of inclined iron bars, one and one-half inches in diameter,
placed 4" apart, and sloping in a direction at right angles to the first
grizzlies. The rock passing between the small bars drops without fur-
ther treatment into the ore bins; that passing over these bars is thrown
by hand into a Blake Breaker, where it is reduced to pieces of
about diameter, dropping thence into the ore bins. The ore and.


The Technic.
rock passing over the first grizzlies is hand-sorted, the poor rock being
thrown upon the dump, and the copper-bearing into 24" Blake Break-
ers, which reduce it to about Z%" pieces and drop it into the ore bins.
From the ore bins at the rock house, the ore is loaded through chutes
into cars holding about five tons each, and it is then taken in trains of
twenty cars to the mill on Portage Lake, a distance of about three
miles. At the mill the cars are dumped into bins located under the
track, and about seventy-five feet distant from the mill. These bins, in
turn, discharge into small cars, which empty automatically into the ore
bins in the upper part of the mill. The ore from the last mentioned
bins runs upon shaking hoppers which feed the stamps.
All of the Lake Superior stamp mills are provided with steam
stamps of the Ball* or Leavittf type. These stamps have an enormous
capacity, crushing from 160 to 230 tons of rock per day, fine enough to
pass a screen.
A man stands by the hopper of every stamp to pick out any
pieces of mass copper, and bits of wood or iron that may be seen, and to
regulate the supply of ore as the working of the stamp may require.
The steam stamps require a large amount of water. At the Atlantic
Mill a large portion of this is supplied by gravity from a neighboring
stream, the pumps being called upon to supply but a small portion.
The pumps are placed within the mill and take their supply from sett-
ling tanks. Twenty-five to thirty tons of water are required to stamp
and wash one ton of ore.
As the ore passes through the screens of the stamp it is collected by
a splash-box, and drops into a launder leading to the separators. This
launder divides the ore stream into three equal portions, one portion
being delivered to each of the three separators A, B, and C. The sep-
arator at the Atlantic Mill consists of a trough about 15 feet long, 18"
wide and 18" deep. Near the bottom, and at the front of each separ-
ator, are four small pipes discharging upon the screens of four jigs just
opposite them. In the axis of the separator and opposite each outlet is
a vertical V/%" pipe, supplied with water from above and opening
downward about 2" from the bottom of the separator. Between each
of these four pipes lies a bed of copper, deposited in the regular work-
ing, and allowed to remain there. As the ore enters the separator it
passes over these beds of copper, coming successively in contact with
the rising currents generated by the supply pipes mentioned. The
head of water in each successive pipe is less, so that the heavy particles
of copper and gangue will fall into the cavity around the first, and pass

through the small opening in the front, and spread themselves upon
the roughing jig. In the second cavity less heavy particles will fall, in
the third still smaller grains, and that ore which passes the fourth
division of the separator is classed as slime, and goes at once to the
settling tanks. The separation accomplished by the device used is very
incomplete, so that the size of the material coming upon the various
screens cannot be given further than has been stated above. Following
each separator are four so-called roughing jigs, each having two
screens; thus the ore from each separator is treated upon a set of eight
screens, each set of eight doing exactly the same work. These screens
are represented in the drawing by Figures 1 to 24.
The hutch work from the roughing jigs passes to twelve finishing
jigs, placed at a lower level, all of which do different work.
We will not follow the course of the ore in detail. The figures on
the drawing are only used to make the description clearer, and have no
reference to the system of treatment. The unbroken lines represent
overflow ; the broken lines represent the direction of the flow from the
lower portion of the apparatus.
The mixed ore coming onto screen No. 1 is there jigged; the hutch
work, passing through the screen, is discharged into a launder leading
to finishing jig No. 2o. A large percentage of the copper contained in
the ore collects upon screen No. 1. This is removed by hand at such
intervals as the amount collected may require. The tailings from No.
1 screen flow upon No. 8, where they are re-jigged. The hutch work
from No. 8 passes into the same launder as that from No. 1; but little
copper is collected upon No. 8, so that the removal of the bed occurs
less often. The tails from No. 8 pass into the tail launder of the mill,
and are subjected to no further treatment.
The ore flowing upon Nos. 2 and 7, 3 and 6, 4 and 5 is treated as
that on Nos. 1 and 8. The hutch work of Nos. 2 and 7 passes to the
finishing jig No. 26; that of Nos. 3 and 6 goes to No. 27; and that of
Nos. 4 and 5 to No. 28. Less copper collects upon Nos. 2, 3 and 4 than
upon No. 1, and practically none collects upon Nos. 5 and 6; these two
screens do, however, gather a large amount of ragging, and make con-
siderable hutch work. The ragging is removed by hand at intervals
and returned to the stamps. The tails from Nos. 5, 6 and 7 are dis-
charged into the tail-launder.
The other sixteen roughing jigs make the same separations as the
first eight, their hutch work passing to the same finishing jigs, and
their tailings going to the tail or waste-iaunder.
The ore flowing upon finishing jig No. 25 is there jigged, the hutch
work goes to box No. 4, the bed of copper collecting upon the screen is
occasionally removed, and the tailings flow into a small settling box at


The Technic.
the lower end of the jig. The overflow from this settling box is carried
to the box below No. 32, while the settlings pass to jig No. 32. The
hutch work from jig No. 32 passes to box No. 2 ; the copper is occasion-
ally removed from this screen ; the overflow passes to a second box at
the lower end of the screen.
The settlings from the last mentioned box pass to jig No. 33, the
hutch work from which goes to box No. 1, and the overflow into the
waste-launder; it is very rarely found necessary to remove the copper
from this screen.
By following the lines of the drawing, it will be seen, that the work
of the jigs Nos. 26, 31 and 34, 27, 30 and 35, 28, 29 and 36 is practically
the same as that given for Nos. 25, 32 and 33, the only difference being,
that every successive screen is of smaller mesh than the preceding: e. g.,
the screens on jigs Nos. 25, 26, 27 and 28 have about the following
mesh; 10, 12, 16 and 20 respectively, while the screens on jigs Nos. 32,
31, 30 and 29 are 16, 20, 25 and 25 mesh respectively. The copper is sel-
dom removed from any of the screens of the finishing jigs, for but lit-
tle collects there. The office of the finishing jigs is to make hutch
work.
The mineral from boxes Nos. 3, 6 and 8 is re-jigged on the finishing
jigs, that from the other boxes is tossed in kieves. The tossing produ-
ces two classes of mineral, the upper or lighter class is re-jigged, while
the lower or heavier class is barrelled for smelting.
The slime treatment of this mill appears quite intricate to the
uninitiated, so we will describe the treatment of but a small portion of
it, which will, however, be sufficient to indicate the method of working.
The slime, when it leaves the separator, passes to a settling tank.
The tails from this tank, which consist principally of muddy water, go
into the tail-launder of the mill, or are used in washing the slimes dur-
ing their subsequent treatment. The settlings from the tank are dis-
tributed over one-half of an Evans Slime Table, the other half of the
table being supplied with water only. This table makes but two
classes, namely heads and tails. The tails go into the waste-launder,
while the heads go to a small centrifugal pump. From the pump the
heads pass to a small settling tank above the second floor of the mill.
The overflow from this tank goes back to the first table to be treated
again. The settlings pass to one of two Evans Tables, called the Finish-
ing Tables. The Finishing Tables are of slightly different construction
from those on which the slimes are first treated, making three classes,
namely heads, middlings, and tails. The tails go back to the first
table, the middlings are retreated on the finishing tables, while the
heads are tossed in a kieve.
As a result of the first tossing two layers are made, the upper one


33
is sent again to the finishing tables, the lower is transferred to a second
kieve. Two layers result from the second tossing ; the upper goes back
to the first kieve, while the lower is barrelled for smelting.
The drawing shows but a small portion of the plan of the mill.
The relative position of the jigs has not been altered, but that of
the tables has been changed to show to the best advantage..

The Technic.
AN EFFICIENCY TEST.
In all classes of machines whose duty it is to change energy from
one form to another the question of efficiency plays a very important
part. Machines which are of a labor-saving character, as, for instance,
wood or iron working machinery, are not required to be so efficient as
those in which there occurs a transformation of energy, such, for
instance as the steam pump or dynamo. In labor saving machines we
expect to have a certain amount of power absorbed and look for the
return in time saved or superiority of execution, but in the case of the
steam pump or dynamo it is different; we look for a certain return in
energy (the larger the better) for every horse power or watt put into it.
If we desire to know what this return is which is known as effi-
ciency, we can readily do so in the case of the pump by calculations
from indicator cards—it is not necessary to connect to any special
device for measuring or absorbing power, that is already provided in
the standpipe, reservoir or mains,— but when we come to the steam
engine, the difficulty presents itself of measuring easily and accurately
the amount of power given out from its shaft or band wheel ; if we
have a small machine this may be readily performed with brake or
dynamometer, but with machines giving a large output, such methods
become impracticable.
The dynamo electric machine, running as a motor, presents a
parallel case to the steam engine — the energy given to the engine is
readily measured from indicator cards, and the energy given to the
motor is as easily measured from volt-meter and am-meter readings,
but when we try to measure the power given out, difficulties present
themselves in each case.
There is one advantage in the dynamo electric machine over the
steam engine, however, and that lies in the fact that the former is per-
fectly reversible, and we can supply mechanical energy to be returned
in electrical energy, or rice versa, at will.
To measure the electrical energy absorbed or given out by any
electrical machine, it is only necessary to multiply its volts by its
amperes, and this product is an exact measure of this energy, the result
will be in watts (1 watt — TJS HP.). It will be seen from this that if a
machine works at a constant voltage, its amperes will be a proportional


35
measure of its energy, or if it works at a constant current (or amperes)
that its volts will be a proportional measure of its power and in what
follows this is to be understood. Suppose we desire to obtain the effi-
ciency of an electrical machine, there must be eliminated engine, belt,
and sometimes counter-shafting friction, for which we are generally
obliged to make approximations.
Another method of testing efficiency, and one that is much used, is
that of employing some form of transmission dynamometer, and the
method is either good or bad, according to whether the dynamometer
is good or bad — most dynamoneters are open to the objection, how-
ever, that a certain amount of power is absorbed, which will appear in
the results as an error.
A brake test is generally satisfactory, but we do not always have the
power to throw away.
The method of supporting an electrical machine so that it is free to
revolve about the axis of the armature is a good one,—the torque of
the driving pulley or shaft is made up of the reaction of the armature
on the fields and of the bearing and brush friction, and this torque we
can measure by counter weighting the fields or frame, but should there
be any considerable air resistance or friction to the armature this
would not be compensated for in the counter weighting of the frame.
In these methods of measuring the mechanical power absorbed or
given out by an electrical machine, there is the objection that one set of
readings must be taken from one class of instruments and another from
an entirely different kind of instruments, using a different set of units,
and in order that the test may be accurate the relations between these
two sets nvust be well defined.
For measuring the power absorbed by a dynamo electric machine
a method has been proposed, which employs a sort of electrical trans-
—-—^
There was given in the Electrical World some time ago a method of
mission dynamometer or, in
other words, an electric motor
whose efficiency at various
speeds and outputs has been
predetermined. By attaching a
dynamo to this motor its effi-
ciency could be quickly and
accurately determined, but there
is again the objection that two
separate sets of instruments
would be required and their
accuracy and relation should be
closely determined.


The Technic.
determining the efficiency of dynamos, and it is briefly as follows: two-
similar machines are mechanically coupled, and these two, toge-
ther with a third machine, driven from some source of power, are elec-
trically connected in the manner shown in the diagram.
Of the two machines, A and B coupled together mechanically, one is
run as a motor and the other as a generator, while the third G is sim-
ply to make up the losses in these two. Suppose the three machines to
be of 110 volts constant potential, and the coupled machines to be of
about 20 kilo watts capacity each, the capacity of the third machine
does not matter, but it should not be less than J the capacity of either
of the other two. Let the three machines be connected in multiple arc,
and suppose that the machines are all running, G as a generator, and
A and B as motors. A and B will evidently absorb but enough power to-
turn themselves and to excite their fields and each will absorb the same
amount of power if they are adjusted for the same voltage Now let
us raise the voltage on machine B, adjusting the E. M. F. of G at the
same time, and the effect will be, first, to raise the counter E. M. F. so-
that no current can pass, and afterwards, if we continue to raise the
voltage to change the machine into a generator that will be giving energy
into the system. Since B is developing a current, and since it is impos-
sible that G. should act as a motor, it is seen that all the current devel-
oped in B must flow back through A and thus increase its power as a
motor.
Suppose, for instance, that when the machines were started, G was
giving 20 amperes at 110 volts, and that A and B were each absorbing 10
amperes; then if the field resistance of B were reduced, we
should very soon find a point where A would be absorbing say
21 amperes, B would be giving no amperes, and G would be giving
21 amperes. We see from this that B is developing just enough cur-
rent to excite its own fields, but giving no energy into the system. Let
the field resistance of B be further reduced, and we will reach a point
finally where we will have, say 200 amperes absorbed by A, 162 amperes
given out by B, and 38 amperes given out by G. Under these condi-
tions we have our two coupled machines running at full load, and
there is a loss in the two coupled machines taken as a system of 32 xllO
watts, or that the product of the efficiencies of each is Jjjf = .81, or,
since we have two similar machines we may say that their efficiencies-
are equal, or that each is equal to i/.Hl = .90 = 90%.


We know that the efficiency of a dynamo varies with the load
because of certain constants, and hence it might be objected that since
the motor must be more heavily loaded than the coupled generator
that the efficiencies would not be equal, but if we overload our motor
to about the same extent that we underload our generator, there is very
slight error in this method. From the above experiment it will be seen
that there has been accomplished the apparent impossibility of making
a small machine run two larger ones, each of which is giving an output
four or five times that of the small machine, but when we reflect that
the only real work accomplished by the small machine, is that of com-
pensating for the friction, heat losses, and field excitations of the
larger machines, the performance does not seem so extraordinary.
There is one great advantage in this method, and it is that, by an
arrangement of switches as shown, there is needed but one instrument
to measure the current, and, as has been shown, this is all that is neces-
sary since all results are proportional to the current in the class of
machine we have assumed.
In testing the efficiencies of const-
ant current machines, the above
method was adopted and the
arrangement is shown in Fig. 2. The
same letters are used as before, and
machines of the same letter were
similarly used in each case. The
machines A and B to be tested are
connected in series with a third ma-
chine G, driven as a generator from
some source of power. The normal
working current of these machines
was the same, and hence their loads were varied by means of their
voltage. Machines A and B were mechanically coupled. Machine G
was started and its brushes so adjusted that it gave the normal current
through machines A and B, which had their brushes so adjusted that
their armatures were not put in motion, or, what amounts to the same
thing, the brushes were adjusted for no load.
Art
The brushes were next shifted forward on machine A, and it was

allowed to come to its normal speed, while the brushes on B were so
adjusted that it gave no volts, or it simply developed enough voltage to
carry the current through itself. Under these conditions, and since the
current is a constant factor, the efficiency of the two machines, taken
as a system, was TV The brushes were next shifted farther forward on
A, and back on B. At the normal speed, the following was true: volts
absorbed by A = 110.6; volts given out by B = 61*, hence the efficiency of
the system was Tfi.&lt;f = .551, or the efficiency of each = ^/^5i — 74.2%.
The brushes were shifted still farther forward on A, and still far-
ther back on B, when the following was true at normal speed. Volts
absorbed by A = 148, volts given out by B = 97, hence the combined
efficiency of the two was 65.5, or the efficiency of each was ]/65.5 =
80.9 %
In making the following test a slightly different method was used.
Instead of using two machines besides the generator, three were used
in the course of the test, and they were connected in pairs, in series
with the generator. By doing this we were enabled to get the efficiency
of each of the three machines when running at two different capa-
cities, and as there seemed such a discrepancy between the power
absorbed by the motor and that given out by the coupled generator, it
was desired to find the relation between these two efficiencies that
entered into the relation ; in other words, it was known as before men-
tioned, that the efficiency of the motor at its higher load was higher
than the efficiency of the coupled generator at its lower load. To
ascertain this the following equations were derived from the given con-
ditions. Represent the three machines to be tested by A, B and C; let
their efficiencies at a certain load be represented by x, y, and z. Suppose
that this is at their higher loads when running as motorst, and let the
corresponding generator efficiencies be represented by Xj, y^ and z„
then if we run the machines two together in rotation we have the fol-
lowing relations:
*Note.—I am aware that Thompson says that for an increase in load the brushes
are to be shifted forward in a generator and backward in a motor, but this applies
only to machines that commutate at or near the space between pole piece tips.
tNOTE.—It is not to be understood that the efficiency as a motor is greater than
as a generator but when two machines are coupled together and one is driving the
other, the motor must necessarily be working at a higher load than the generator.

Although we have six equations and six unknown quantities they
do not admit of a solution except in ratios or products, and hence the
following means was employed to obtain the efficiency of one of the
machines as a generator, and afterward, when the machine was run
again, it was run at the same output. The two machines A and B were
uncoupled and run separately at their normal speed. The volts
absorbed by each was observed, and was as follows: A 22, B 24. They
were then coupled in series and run as before shown, so that the ter-
minals of B gave no voltage, and the voltage at the terminals of A was 47,
from which condition we may learn ihat when run at aload of 47 volts, A
absorbs within itself 23 volts, since B absorbs 24 volts when run at no
load, as we saw when we run it separately as a motor, hence the power
given out by A must have been the equivalent of 24 volts, or it
absorbed 23 volts of the 47 put into it. Next let us shift the brushes so
that B acts as a motor and A as a generator, and let us run A under the
same conditions as a generator as we have run it as a motor. If A as a
motor received an amount of power proportional to 47, it must receive
the same amount over its coupling when run as a generator, and it is
evident that if we cause it to give out at its terminals 47 volts, less that
absorb ed by itself (23 volts), that we shall have it running under the
same conditions as a generator as it has just been running as a motor.
If A receives at its coupling power equivalent to 47 volts, the volts
received by the motor B must equal 47 plus that absorbed by itself. The
total of volts received by B was 72.5, or 25.5 volts absorbed by itself.
By again reversing the machine and reasoning the same way we find
that 97 volts are required to give out power proportional to 72.5 volts
over its coupling. Another similar operation shows that B received 123
volts and gave out on its coupling power proportional to 97 volts, hence
it must have possessed an efficiency at this load of ffc = .788 — 78.8%,
which we will call yx of the equations. Perhaps the process would be
best understood from the following table, in which the five succes-
sive operations are shown:

Starting with this value of yx (78.8) we are now prepared to deter-
mine the value of the other five unknown quantities. The observations
gave the following results, which are equated to their proper

The normal working current of these machines was 10 amperes,


41
and was maintained as near as possible to this value throughout the
test.
By these results it will he seen that there is quite a marked differ-
ence in the efficiencies of the same machine when run at different
loads, a difference that we should expect to see in machines of this
class, for there is always the same power expended in energizing the
field magnets. The current in the armature is constant, and hence
heat losses, due to fall of potential, are constant. The distortion of
the magnetic field and its consequent losses are the only thing that can
produce any changes of loss in the machines with varying loads, and
this variation seems very slight. If we have a constant amount of
matter lost at all loads then there must be a marked difference in the
ratios of power given out to power received, and it will follow that the
more we can load our machine the greater will be its efficiency. From
the percentages found, and by calculating with these from the data
the amount of loss in each machine, we find that it is about the same in
■each case. Fred. H. Loveridge.


OVERHEAD BRACING WITH TWO PANELS OF
TRUSSING.
In the past few years the building of longer and longer bridges, thus
necessitating a greater depth of truss, and changes in types of construc-
tion have brought into quite common practice the use of overhead brac-
ing with two panels of trussing. While discussions of the stresses in
overhead bracing with one panel of trussing are common enough in the
text books, the writer has never seen any discussion of the same with
more than one panel of trussing.
W Let Fig; (1) represent the skeleton of a sys-
P, tern of overhead bracing with two panels of
trussing.
Let a load W, caused by the component in
the direction of the strut of the pull of the
lateral, be applied at B. (To be theoretically
exact we have in addition to this load a small
local load at each of the points A, B, C, D,
E, and J" caused by the wind pressure on the
posts and bracing. In the following discus-
sion these small local loads have been omit-
ted as their influence on the result will be
small considered from a practical stand-
point.) The two posts being of equal section
may be considered to carry equal bending
moments and shears; hence a horizontal force
of w will be resisted at each of the points O
lfl__&gt; w and H.

pression, where Plt Pnand Ps are computed as above. Care should be
taken to proportion the posts A O and B Hloi the bending as well as
for the direct stress caused by the wind bracing. It is also usually
necessary to splice the posts because of the impracticability of obtaining
material long enough in one length. This splice should be made just
above the point D and proportioned sufficiently strong to carry the
maximum tensile flange stress caused by the bending moment less the
minimum regular compressive truss stress.
This is the theoretical discussion. Practically other considerations
enter into the problem which may perhaps be considered to render these
results of little value. To a very large extent the correctness of the
stresses computed depends upon the shopwork. The struts being a little
long or a little short or a very small amount of wind in the posts will
change the stresses very materially. The length of the strut A B is
particularly difficult to make exact. There are often countersunk rivets
on the outside of the posts, then eyebars, then wing plates for laterals
as well as for A D and B Cand outside of all a yoke plate for the strut
connection. The eyebars are almost certain to over-run and the amount
they and the wing plates will pack up is a variable quantity.
For these reasons it may be desirable to consider the upper panel of
bracing as pin connected, proportioning the splice just above D only
strong enough to hold the post truly in line. The stresses may then be
computed as follows:—

carried by the strut to E to be there resisted by the bending.

'The stresses given by this solution vary somewhat from those given
by the first solution; those in the lower panel being somewhat smaller
and tho«ein the upper panel somewhat greater.
In this discussion there is another fact which should not escape,
notice. Even in railroad bridges, where the maximum wind and live
loads occur at the same time, wind loads are seldom taken into account
in proportioning the trusses. Even with a moderate wind load the
bending moments and direct stresses in the posts are large. The result-
ing direct stress is particularly large in the channel of the post A Q
which is the compression flange of the post acting as a girder. This
channel carries in addition to the regular truss loads; first,—the direct
compression caused by the load W; and second,— .the compression
caused by the bending moments.
Whichever of the two methods we use to compute the stress in our
wind bracing, it is an undeniable fact that, in consequence of not being
properly porportioned to carry these stresses, the posts would probably
fail long before the struts and diagonals. It is quite common practice
to make all three struts of the same section as well as to make both sets
of diagonals alike. When the stresses are carefully computed this will
be found to be far from meeting the true necessity of the case. The
second method here discussed is easy of computation, theoretically
exact when the posts are spliced at D, and gives results sufficiently
accurate for all ordinary purposes even when the posts are rigidly-
continuous. I M. Wolverton, '90.

Level the transit carefully again. Test the adjustment as at first.
Repeat the corrections and tests, in this manner, till no devitation

motions. This may be tested by first adjusting the plate levels about
the spindle with the plates clamped; then releasing the plates and
clamping the spindle; and finally testing the adjustment of the plate
levels about the axis of the vernier plate. If found out of adjustment
with respect to the motion of the vernier plate, after carefully repeated
trials, it shows that the two plates do not revolve about the same axis.
Leave the plate levels in adjustment with respect to the spindle if the
principal work is running straight lines and reversion on the spindle.
If reading angles is the principal work leave the plate levels in adjust-
ment with respect to the motion of the vernier plate. In case this
defect is serious, the transit should go to its maker and be recentered.
Should it be found impossible to adjust the plate levels, after
repeated careful trials, about either axis of motion, it shows that axis


47
of motion with respect to which this difficulty exists, to be badly dam-
aged. Usually the maker must fix it. Make this test after the transit
has a fall.
TRANSIT.
2. Transit. Line op Sight. Closed Wyes.
a. Cond. A place to set the transit in is needed where well defined
fixed marks can be readily found on opposite sides of it at a distance
away as great as the telescope will show them clearly. It is well to
have the marks at about the same angular distance, above on one side
and below on the other, from the place chosen. The plate levels should
be in adjustment, and the reversions of the transit made about the
axis they are adjusted for.
b. Dir.
Preparations. Set up the transit firmly in a suitable place. Level
it carefully. Set the line of sight on a distant, well defined, fixed mark.
Reverse the telescope about the transit axis and find a similar mark in
apparent line. Turn the telescope back and see if the line of sight strike
the first mark. Repeat these pointings, making the necessary correc-
tions in the setting and levelling of the transit till the line of sight will
surely strike the first mark again when the telescope is turned-back.
Test. Release the necessary clamps and reverse the telescope
about both axes. Level the transit if the levels show a slight disturb-
ance- Set the line of sight on the first mark. Reverse the telescope
about the transit axis and see if the second mark is in apparent line.
Turn thejtelescope back to the first mark, as before, and, by the same
means, make sure the line of sight will strike that mark. Then reverse
the telescope as at first and note the deviation of the line of sight from
the second mark.
Correct, by estimation, one-fourth of the deviation of the vertical
cross wire by means of the screws at right angles with it that hold the
cross wires in the telescope tube. Whether the telescope shows objects
right side up or not, turn these screws as if to increase the apparent dev-
iation. Loosen the screw permitting the desired movement before turn-
ing the other. Leave the screws under a gentle even strain. If the
deviation is large, loosen the other pair of screws slightly, but have a
care not to get the vertical cross wire inclined. . "•
Set the line of sight again upon the first mark, as at first. Repeat
the tests, corrections, and tests till no deviation appears when the test
is made. ••• -"
c. Rem. This adjustment is required theoretically in reading
angles but not in running straight lines. It conforms to the best work
ing conditions, however, both optically, and in the field practice.

3. Transit. Open Wyes. Striding Level.
a. Dir. Adjusting.
Preparation. Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully by
the plate levels, or disc level. Bring the transit axis over a levelling
screw. Clamp the spindle. Place the feet of the striding level on the
bearings for them on transit axis. Level the striding level with the lev-
elling surface to the transit. See that it stands freely on its feet, and
remains level.
Test. Carfully lift up the striding level, reverse it, and replace its
feet to the bearings, without jar. In the same manner return this level
to its first position. See if the bubble again reads level. Repeat these
reversions,making the necassary corrections in the setting or levelling
of the transit till the striding level bubble will surely read level again
when returned to its first position. Then reverse the striding level as
at first and note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading. •
Correct, by estimation, one-half of the deviation by means of the
adjusting screw, or screws at one end of the level tube provided for a
vertical adjustment.
Set the striding level, by means of the levelling screws of the
transit, to read and stand level again. Test the adjustment as at first.
Repeat the corrections and tests, in this manner, till no deviation is
shown by the test.
6. Rem. In making this adjustment stand the striding level ver-
tically over the bearings. Do not incline it. If inclined it may show
this adjustment apparently imperfect. This requires a second adjust-
ment sidewise to bring the axis of the level tube into a plane parallel
to the line of the points of support of the feet of the striding level.
c. Dir. Adjusting Sidewise.
Preparation. Make the last adjustment as perfect as practicable.
Test. Incline the striding level slightly on its feet. Return it to
its first position. See if the bubble again reads level. Incline it in the
opposite direction about the same amount. Return it again to its first
position. See if the bubble will surely read level. Repeat these trials
making the necessary corrections in the setting or levelling of the tran-
sit, till the bubble will surely read level again when returned to its first
position and stand at the same reading when inclined. Then incline
the striding level, as at first and note the deviation of the bubble from
a level reading. Incline it a like amount in the opposite direction and
note the deviation.
Correction. By means of the screws for a sidewise adjustment set
the level tnbe so it will show the same deviation in the same direction


49
for the same inclination either way from its vertical stand, when tested
as above described.
d. Rem. The bubble should read level in all three positions. If
it does not the bore of the glass tube is not uniform and it should be
replaced by a perfect one at the first opportunity. In using such a
striding level be very careful to stand it plumb on its feet.
This adjustment, and the preceeding, need to be made alternately
together when first the bubble tube is attached to its base.
If, for any reason, the bubble tube has to be disconnected from its
base, loosen but one of the sidewise screws and notice how tight it is.
Likewise if there is a check screw to the vertical adjustment, leave it
alone,—only unscrew the adjusting screw. When the bubble tube is
again restored to its connections with its base it can be set almost in
its proper place by bringing the loosened screws to their bases again
and not require so much adjustment.
e, Dir. Transit Axis Trunnions. Soundness.
Preparation. Separate the transit axis from the telescope. Clean
its trunnions, and their bearings in the wyes of the transit. Set up the
transit, in place of even temperature, firmly. Level the transit care-
fully. Clamp the spindle so the transit axis will stand over levelling
screw. Place the transit axis in its wye bearings. Stand the striding
level on the transit axis with its feet on the trunnions. Level the strid-
ing level carefully with the levelling screws to the transit. Eeverse it
and put it in adjustment. Level the striding level carefully again and
see that everything is stable and steady so the striding level will stand
level.
Test. Lift the striding level off. Replace it carefully. See if it
reads level again. Repeat these trials, making any corrections that
may be needed in setting or levelling of the transit, or adjustmennt of
the striding level, or otherwise, till the striding level bubble will surely
read level again when replaced, and stand level.
Lift the striding level off.' Turn the transit axis slightly in its bear-
ings. Replace the striding level as it was before—do not reverse it.
Notice if it still reads level. Remove the striding level, turn the transit
axis back to its first position, replace the striding level as before, and
see if it again reads level. Repeat these trials, and make sure of the
stability of the apparatus, also of the reading of the level after the
transit axis has been turned.
So test the transi; axis turning it a little more at each trial till it
has been examined entirely round its trunnions and returned to its
first position.
/. Rem. Whenever the striding level fails to read level in these
tests it indicates an imperfection in the trunnions as to their roundness.


The Technic.
The method here given will not show which trunnion is not round,
theoretically, but in the practice with a transit axis whose trunnions
have been marred it is usually easy to find the trouble. In any case
the method may be used to prove the roundness of the trunnions. By
providing a support for one foot of the striding level while the other
rests on a trunnion, that trunnion can be examined separately. Usual-
ly the transit axis must go to the maker to be refitted and the transit
may have to go with it. The finest transits must always go to the
maker for this repair. The trunnions of the transit axis of a transit, if
not so fine a grade, have been smoothed, and brought to the same size,
by soft wood clamps, oil, flour of emery, and turning transit axis with
the hand, while a trunnion was held in the clamps where the oil and
emery was applied. This was so successfully done that the striding
level in use with the transit would show no difference of any kind
between the two trunnions. Such a thing is not recommended for prac-
tice but may serve when nothing better can be done, except at great
loss'of time, and expense. When emery is used in any form about an
instrument the utmost care must be taken to get rid of it all. It is so
liable to get into the working parts and do irreparable injury that its
use is prohibited by many persons, and tripoli, or even pumice, sub-
stituted. Nothing coarser than flour of emery should be used.
g. Dir. Transit Axis Trunnions Equal Size.
Preparation. Open the wye clamps, take out the transit axis, clean
the trunnions and their bearings in the wyes. Set up the transit firmly
Level it carefully. Clamp the spindle so the transit axis will stand
over a levelling screw. Place the transit axis in its wye bearings.
Stand the striding level on the transit axis with its feet on the trun-
nions. Level the striding level, carefully with the levelling screws to
the transit. Reverse it and put it in adjustment. Level the striding
level carefully again and see that everything is stable and steady so
the striding level will stand level.
Test. Set the striding level off. Lift out the transit axis carefully,
reverse it, and replace it in the wyes without jar. Eeplace the striding
level without reversing it. Notice if it still reads level. Remove it as
before. Restore the transit axis to its first position without jar.
Replace the striding level. See if it again reads level. Repeat these
trials. Make sure of the stability of the apparatus and of the reading
of the level when the transit axis is reversed.
h. Rem. If the level does not read level when the transit axis is
reversed it shows the trunnions to be of different sizes. They must
usually be fitted by the maker, but may be treated as noted in /. This
method tests for differences in size. Should a difference be shown, the
trunnions are not made with precision enough for the striding level or
the level is too sensitive for the transit.


51
Professor Durand's three point calliper may be made to give still
more delicate tests for roundness and differences in size.
Theoretically this test will show whether the two trunnions have a
common axis. Practically, this defect would have to be so large as to
be a disgrace to all shops of the present day, for it to appear. It is true
that trunnions are turned to what is practically the same size, even
when using the term size with rigid precision. - That is, the trunnions
are of a size so nearly, that if the tests appear to show a difference,
that difference is quite likely due to the errors of the test (observation,
apparatus, temperature, etc.) instead of the difference in size of the
trunnions. Some very elaborate tests would seem to confirm this view.
A level bubble can be read with as much more precision, with a
reading glass, than without, as the graduations of the plate can.
i. Dir. Levelling the Transit Axis.
Set up the transit and level it carefully with the plate levels. Stand
the striding level on the transit axis over a levelling screw. Level the
striding level carefully with the levelling screws of the transit. Reverse
it and put it in adjustment. Level the striding level carefully and see
that everything is steady so the striding level will stand level. Turn
the transit to its second position,—do not reverse it. Level the striding
level again. By repeated trials set the transit by means of the levelling
screws so the striding level will stand level in either position of the
transit. Test the striding level again for its adjustment. Repeat these
operations till the striding level shows the transit axis to be level in
both positions of the transit and itself appears to be in adjustment
upon making the final test.
j. Rem. The transit axis will then be level but the spindle will not
be vertical unless the axis is in adjustment. This .adjustment is given
below. It may be made, by using the striding level as directed in one
of the methods given for adjusting the axis, at the time of levelling the
transit axis. Then the transit will be completely levelled by means of
the striding level. It will be much more precisely set than any plate
levels will set it. In the better grades of transits the plate levels are
approximate setting only.
4. Transit. Open Wyes. Line of Sight.
a. Cond. Select a place for making this adjustment in, from
which a well denned fixed mark can be seen when the telescope is
pointed level, or nearly so, and as far away as the telescope will show it
plainly. Use the striding level to the transit axis. The trunnions to
the transit axis must be round, of the same size, and centered on the
same axidal line.

the line of sight on a distant, well defined, fixed mark, with the transit
axis carefully levelled. Kemove the striding level.
Test. Carefully lift the telescope from the wyes, turn it over, the
objective direted towards the mark, and replace it in the wyes without
jar. Eeplace the striding level and see if the transit axis now stands level.
Eestore the telescope to its first position and replace the striding level.
See if the line of sight again strikes the mark and if the transit axis is-
level. Repeat these trials making the necessary correction in the setting
or levelling of the transit or the adjustment of the striding level till
sure that the transit axis stands level in both positions and the line of
sight strikes the mark in the first one. Leave the telescope in its second
position. Note the deviation of the line of sight from the mark.
Correct one half of this deviation by means of the cross wire screws
at right angles with the vertical cross wire, as directed in Sec. 2 6.
Set the line of sight again upon the mark as at first. Repeat the
preparations, tests, corrections, preparations and tests till the test shows
no deviation.
c. Rem. This adjustment can be made in the way described in Sec.
2 for closed wyes when the telescope can be reversed on the transit
axis.
5. Transit. Closed Wyes. Axis.
a. Cond. The plate levels should be in adjustment. The line of
sight should be in adjustment. The objective slide should be in good
line. If the transit has a telescope level, or other delicate level it should
be levelled by it as directed in Sees. 3, or 7. In making this adjustment
the telescope should be turned through a vertical angle of about 90°
—from about 45° above to about 45° below the horizon.
6. Dib.
Preparation. Set up the transit firmly near some high, well
defined, fixed mark, so that when the telescope shall be directed to it the
elevation will be about 45°. Level the transit carefully, as above noted.
Set the line of sight on the high mark. Read, or estimate, the angle of
elevation. Direct the telescope at the same an *le below the horizon, on
the same side of the transit. Find, or fix a mark in apparent line.
Turn back to the upper mark and see if the line of sight again strikes it.
Repeat the pointings at both marks making the necessary corrections
in the setting and levelling of the transit, and in the position of the
lower mark, till sure the line of sight will strike both marks with the
transit carefully levelled.
Test. Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about
both axes. Set the line of sight upon the upper mark. Notice if the
transit is still level. If not it must be reset, the levels adjusted if needed


be, and the whole preparations repeated. Having made sure of the
setting of the transit and the pointing of the line of sight, direct the
telescope downwards, as before, and rind, or fix, a second mark in
apparent line, with the same care and tests used in locating the first
mark. See if the two lower marks are the same or in exact line. Leave
the telescope so as to show this
Correction. Move the vertical cross wire over one-fourth of the
apparent distance between these two lower marks, by raising, or lower-
ing, one end of the transit axis, by the device provided.
Prepare for and make a test of the adjustment, as at first. Eepeat
these tests, corrections, and tests, till the test shows the two lower marks
in the same line, or as one.
c. Rem. This adjustment sets the axes at right angles with each
other. It, theoretically, enables one to measure correctly the angle
between the vertical planes of lines having very different angles of
elevation.
6. Transit. Open Wyes. Axis.
o. Rem. The axis may be adjusted in the way given for closed
wyes in Sec. 5. This involves levelling the transit with the striding level
independently of this adjustment, which is involved in the usual
process of thus levelling the transit. If the striding level feet do not
stand on the transit axis trunnions use the, process for adjusting the
axis given next below. If the transit has a delicate level attached, it
may be levelled by that, according to the next paragraph or according
to Sec. 7, b.
b. Dir. Levelling with the transit axis striding level.
Set up the transit firmly and level it carefully with the plate levels.
Place the striding level in position. Turn the transit on its spindle so
the striding level will stand over the levelling screw. Level the striding
level carefully with the levelling screws to the transit. Turn the transit
one quarter round and level the striding level again. Turn the transit
back to its first position—do not reverse it. Level the striding level
again. Turn the transit to its second position, —do not reverse it. Level
the striding level again. By repeated trials set the transit by means of
its levelling screws so the striding level will read level in either of
these positions.
Reverse the transit on its spindle. Notice reading of the strid-
ing level. Reverse back again and see if the striding level now reads
level. Repeat these reversions, making the necessary correction in the
setting and levelling of the transit, till the striding level will certainly
read level in the first position and return it to the same reading always
in the reversed position of the transit. Leave the transit reversed.
Note the deviation of the bubble of the striding level from a level
reading.


The Technic.
Correct one-half this deviation by the vertical adjusting screw of
the striding level tube.
Repeat the levelling, as first noted above, then the reversions, and
make any further correction that may be needed in the setting of the
striding level tube by its vertical adjusting screw, as before.
Continue these operations till the striding level will read level in
both positions of the transit, when it is reversed.
By the same means, set the striding level so it will read level when
the transit is turned one-quarter round and reversed as before.
Proceed with the experiments till the striding level is set to read
level in any position of the transit when turned around on its spindle,
or, speaking theoretically, till the striding level will stand level during a
complete revolution of the transit on its spindle.
c. Rem. The spindle will then stand plumb. The striding level is
adjusted to the spindle and not to its feet, by this process. Any such
delicate level on the transit may be similarly treated and used. The
telescope level, or the vernier level, being provided with a slow motion
screw, may be set by that instead of an adjusting screw, as above des-
scribed. This is detailed in Sec. 7, 6.
d Dir. For adjusting the axis. First method.
Preparation. Set up the transit firmly near some high, well defined,
fixed, mark, so that when the telescope shall be directed to it, the
elevation will be about 45°. Level the transit as directed in b.
or in Sec. 7,6. Set the line of sight on the high mark noticing the level
to see that the transit stands steady. Read, or estimate, the angle of
elevation. Direct the telescope at the same angle below the horizon,
on the same side of the transit. Notice the level again, and see that it
reads level. If not, repeat these operations till it does and both transit
and level work satisfactorily. Then find, or fix, a mark in apparent
line. Turn back to the upper mark and see if the line of sight again
strikes it. Notice the level again and see that it reads level. Re-
peat the pointings at both marks, noticing the level, and making the
necessary corrections in the setting and levelling of the transit, also in
the position of the lower mark, till sure the line of sight will strike both
marks with the transit carefully levelled.
Test. Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about
both axes. Set the line of sight upon the upper mark. Notice if
the transit is still level. If not it must be reset, and levelled as directed
in 6, or in Sec. 7, b. Having made sure of the setting of the transit and
the pointing of the line of sight, direct the telescope downwards, as
before, and find, or fix, a second mark in apparent line, with the same
care and tests used in locating the first mark. See if the two lower


55
marks are the same, or in exact line. Leave the telescope so as to
show this.
Correction. Move the vertical cross wire over one-fourth of the
apparent distance between these two lower marks, by raising, or lower-
ing, one end of the transit axis by the device provided.
Prepare for and make a test of the adjustment, as at first. Repeat
these tests, corrections, and tests, till the test shows the two lower
marks in the same, line, or as one.
e. Rem. The methods of b, c, and d, will reveal defects of con-
struction that can be shown by the striding level. For this reason the
examinations noted in Sec. 3, should be first made. The process of b
will not show a difference in the size of the transit axis trunnions.
/. For adjusting the axis. Second method.
Preparations. Set up the transit firmly and level it carefully with
the plate levels. Place the striding level in position. Turn the transit
on its spindle so the striding level will stand over a levelling screw.
Level the striding level carefully with the levelling screws to the tran-
sit. Remove the striding level, reverse it, and replace it, as in adjusting
it. See if it is much out of adjustment. If it is, adjust it approx-
mately.
Level the striding level carefully with the levelling screws to the
transit. Turn the transit one-quarter round and level the striding level
again. Turn the transit back to its first position,—do not reverse it.
Level the striding level again. By repeated trials set the transit by
means of its levelling screws so the striding level will read level in either
of these positions.
Adjust the striding level by the process of Sec. 3, a, as perfectly as
possible.
Level the transit again as above directed. Test the adjustment of
the striding level. Repeat these operations till sure the transit stands
steady, the striding level is in nice adjustment, and that it reads level
in either position of the transit.
Test. Reverse the transit on its spindle. Notice the reading of the
striding level. Reverse back again and see if the striding level now
reads level. Repeat these reversions, making the neceseary corrections
in the setting or levelling of the transit, or the adjustment of the strid-
ing level, till the bubble will certainly read level in the first position of
the transit and return to the same reading always, in its reversed
position. Leave the transit reversed. Note the deviation of the bubble
of the striding level from the level reading
Correct one-half this deviation by raising, or lowering, one end of
the transit axis by the device provided.
Prepare for and make a test of the adjustment, as at first. Repeat


The Technic.
these tests, corrections, and tests till the test shows the striding level
always to read level. Last of all try the striding level for adjustment
on its own feet. If not in adjustment repeat the work.
g. Rem. This is the usual way of levelling the transit, levelling
the transit axis, and adjusting the striding level, at one time.
7. Transit. Telescope Level.
a. Rem. Telescope levels are attached by nuts permitting a ver-
tical motion at each end of the level tube, and without any sidewise
adjustment, such as is commonly seen on the wye level, and on striding
levels. This makes it important that these level tubes be carefully set
by the maker, and that the glass bubble tube be placed, and fastened in
its brass case with every care. Striding levels are used, fitting on col-
lars turned on the body tube of the telescope. These may be adjusted
in every particular. They are very easily attached and detached, will
not fall off and can be used on the telescope either side up. The
ability to completely adjust them makes them more desirable than the
old form, even if provided with a double ground bubble tube reading
either side up, which is protected by a loose brass shell outside the brass
case of the bubble tube. All such bubble tubes should be scaled
directly on the glass itself, not by a brass scale standing over it.
This adjustment is for the purpose of setting the level tube or the
horizontal cross wire so the bubble will read level when the line of sight
is horizontal. With the level tube attached to the telescope body tube,
as first above noted, the level tube is adjusted and there is no very good
way of setting the horizontal cross wire in its best position in the
telescope. With the striding level standing on collars turned on the
outside of the body tube the cross wires are adjusted and the horizontal
wire brought to its best position in the telescope. With the striding
level no aid is required,—one can make the adjustment alone
To adjust the attached telescope level, there are three principal
steps: First, levelling the transit with the telescope level. Second, set-
ting the line of sight horizontal. Third, setting the level tube, and test-
ing the adj ustment. This method of levelling the transit is necessary,
or the delicate telescope level would be made to depend upon the
plate levels.
6. Dir. For levelling the transit.
Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully with the plate levels.
See the telescope level tube to read level by means of the clamp and
slow motion screw, to the transit axis. Reverse the transit on its spin-
dle. Notice the telescope level reading. Reverse back. See if the
telescope level reads level again. If not, set it to read level again.
Reverse the transit again and notice the telescope level reading. Con-
tinue these reversions, making the necessary corrections in the setting


57
of the transit and the telescope level till it will certainly read level in
the first position of the transit and return to the same reading always,
when the transit is reversed. Leave the transit reversed. .Note the
deviation of the bubble of the telescope level from a level reading.
Correct one half of this deviation by the slow motion screw to the
transit axis.
Level and reverse the transit again, as before.
Repeat these operations till the telescope level will read level in
either the first, or the reversed positon, of the transit.
Turn the transit one quarter round and level it again, as above set
forth.
By repeated trials, making the necessary corrections in the setting
of the transit and the telescope level, as above directed, make this level
read level for any postion of the transit when turned on its spindle.
c. Dir. For setting the line of sight level.
Level the transit as above directed. Leave the telescope clamped.
Measure off, each way from the center of the transit the same distance,
say 150' or 200', and drive a stake till firm, at the end of each measure-
ment. Number these stakes 1 and 2. See that the transit is level and
stands steady. Take accurate rod readings on the tops of the stakes.
Subtract the reading on 1 from the reading on 2 and preserve the sign
of the result, + or —. Call this result k.
Move the transit to a place, a short distance, say 30', beyond stake
1, carrying the telescope clamped as last used. Set up the transit here
and level it as directed in 6. Take a rod reading, ri on stake 1 and
another r2 on stake 2 just as the first ones were taken. Record these
with their numbers. Find r2 — r1, noting the sign. Call this k'. See
if k — k'. Make sure of the whole work.
If k = k' the line of sight is horizontal and the level tube in adjust-
ment. If k' does not equal k , measure the distances from the transit's
center to stake 1, , and to stake 2 , d2. Find a rod reading, B2 for
stake 2 by the following equation, observing all signs.
*&gt; = r&gt;+J^d&gt;(D-
Hold up the rod on stake 2 ( set at this reading S 2, if a target rod )
and by means of the slow motion screw to the transit axis, set the line
of sight so it will give the rod reading, R 2, on stake 2.
Test by taking a new rod reading Ji, on 1. Find Ri — i2,, observing
the sign of the result. See if this result very nearly equals k.
Proceed with these trials and tests till the line of sight is set so that
-R2 — Rx at a test equals k or so near it, that the experiments show it to
t&gt;e useless to try further.


The Technic.
d. Dir. Fob setting the level tube.
Set the level tube to read level by means of the nuts at one end of
it. Start that nut first that will permit the desired movement. Leave
the nuts under a gentle even strain.
Test the level tube adjustment by additional rod readings and finally
set it so that R2 — Rt = k when the bubble stands level,—or as near this
condition as can be.
e. Rem. If the ground is near enough level drive the stakes so the
first rod readings on them will be equal. Then k — o. After that, pro-
ceed as above directed, but use the equation below instead of (1), ob-
serving all signs.
With some experience in making this adjustment,probably the equations
will be dispensed with.
f. Dir. Double ground level tube.
Adjust as directed in b, c, d, and e, above, using but one side.
Release the necessary clamps and reverse the telescope about
both axes and set the line of sight horizontal by means of the rod
readings on stakes 1 and 2. See if the bubble of the telescope level
reads level. Repeat the observations and rod readings till sure the
line of sight is level, the transit steady, and the bubble gives the same
reading. Note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading.
Set the bubble to read level by means of the slow motion screw to
the transit axis. Take a rod reading on stake 2,—the distant stake.
Move the horizontal cross wire by means of the screws at right
angles with it, that hold the cross wires in the telescope tube, and set it
so the rod reading on stake 2 will equal the half sum of the former rod
readings on this stake,—the one when the line of sight was level, and
the one when the bubble read level. Whether the telescope shows ob-
jects right side up or not, turn these screws as if to increase the appar-
ent deviation of the second rod reading from the first. Loosen the
screw permitting the desired movement before turning the other. Leave
the screws under a gentle even strain. If the difference between the
two rod readings is large, loosen the other pair of screws slightly, but
be very careful not to turn the cross wire ring. Be certain the transit
stands steady, and the rod readings are correct.
Set the line of sight again level by means of rod readings on both
stakes.
Set the level tube to read level by means of the nuts at one end of
it. Start that nut first that will permit the desired movement. Leave
the nuts under a gentle even strain.
Test the level tube adjustment by additional rod readings and final-


59
ly set it so that Rz — iJj = k when the bubble stands level,—or as near
this condition as may be.
Release the necessary clamps, and reverse the telescope about both
axes. Set the line of sight level by rod readings on both stakes. See if
the bubble of the telescope level (now the same side up again as at first
adjusted) reads level. Repeat the observations and rod readings till
sure the line of sight is level, the transit steady, and the bubble gives
the same reading. Note the deviation of the bubble from a level read-
ing.
If this is considerably less than before, for the other side of the bub-
ble tube, make the same observations and adjustments for this side as
above detailed for the other.
Release the necessary clamps, reverse the telescope about both axes
and make the tests just above noted anew for the side of the bubble tube
which is again uppermost.
Repeat these trials, adjustments, and tests till the telescope level
and the horizontal cross wire are so set that the line of sight will be
level when the bubble reads level which ever side up the bubble tube
may be, as shown by rod readings on both stakes.
If persistent trial under favorable conditions of light, seeing, tem-
perature, and steadiness, does not complete these adjustments so they
will bear the test imposed, or very nearly so, repeat the work and make
these adjustments so the two sides of the bubble tube will read the same
(not a level reading) when the line of sight is level. Record this read-
ing and fasten it in the transit box.
g. Rem. By these last adjustments the horizontal cross wire is set
nearer its proper place in the telescope tube if not at that place. The
trouble of these adjustments shows the value of such a level tube in
such a place. Once the level tube is proven to be ground alike on both
sides it makes matters somewhat easier. Even with a perfect level tube
there can be no sidewise adjustment and the device is not nearly as
perfect as that of a striding level standing on collars turned on the body
tube of the telescope.
h. Dir. Horizontal cross wire. Striding telescope level.
Preparations Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully with its
plate levels. Clamp the spindle so the telescope will stand over a level-
ling screw Clamp the telescope level as shown by its striding level. Ad-
just the striding level fully as directed in Sec. 3. Level the transit by
means of the telescope level as directed above in 6. See at the last that
the striding telescope level remains in adjustment with respect to its
own feet.
Direct the telescone to some object and find a mark on it in line
with the horizontal cross wire when the transit is carefully levelled by


The Technic.
the telescope level and that level is in good adjustment. Prove the
steps and make sure the conditions are favorable.
Jest. Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about
both axes, and set it level as before. Be sure the striding level keeps
its adj ustment. Note the deviation of horizontal cross wire from the
mark it covered before.
Correction. Move the horizontal cross wire by means of the screws
at right angles with it, that hold the cross wires in the telescope
tube, and set it so it will cover a place midway between the two above
noted, when the telescope is level.
Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat the test, correction, and test
till the horizontal cross wire will cover the same mark with the telescope
•either side up, and level.
i. Rem. This arrangement of a telescope level is the best for gen-
eral use. The same striding level may be made to fit the transit axis
also.
8. Vertical Circle Vernier.
a. Rem. If the telescope is provided with a level as above noted in
Sec. 7, it may be put in adjustment, or the horizontal cross wire ad-
justed, as directed in this section, the line of sight set horizontal, and
the vernier of the vertical circle set to read zero when the line of sight
is level. This is best when practicable.
Some transits have a vertical arc in place of a full circle. Some
have two opposite verniers to the vertical circle, some but one. Some
transits have two opposite verniers set horizontal and two opposite
sectors of a vertical circle fitting these verniers. With opposite verniers
an examination should be made to ascertain if the verniers give
readings 180° apart, or sufficiently near so,—that is, within a
reasonable limit of instrumental precision, temperature, perfection of
construction, and closeness of reading considered. This will be ascer-
tained by taking numerous readings on different parts of the circle or
opposite sectors, both direct and reversed, and comparing them.
If the transit has no telescope level and but one vernier to its vertical
circle, or if the verniers and circle, or opposite sectors, are not well cen-
tered and in good working order, this adjustment must be made by the
peg method given for the telescope level in Sec. 7, c, and d, the level-
ling being done by the plate levels. This adjustment then must depend
upon the least sensitive of the plate levels,—the one parallel to the
telescope. To provide against this a delicate level is attached to the bar
carrying the opposite verniers on transit having such, which is con-
trolled by a slow motion screw similar to the one used for the transit
axis. This level may be used to level the transit with, as directed in
Sec. 7, b. These conditions call for several forms of this adjustment as


61
was the case with the telescope level, which are indicated above, except
the one given below.
6. Die. Full vertical, circle. Opposite verniers.
Preparations. Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully by the
plate levels. Complete the levelling by the level for the verniers of the
vertical circle, if there is one, as directed in Sec. 7, b. Set the vertical
circle to read, vernier A, 0° 00' 00" and vernier B, 180° 00' 00". Turn the
transit on its spindle, direct the telescope to some object and find a
mark in line with the horizontal cross wire. See that the transit is steady
and the level to be trusted.
Test. Release the necessary clamps, reverse the telescope about both,
axes, see that the levels show the transit to be steady and levelled, and
set the verniers to read, ver. A, 180° 00' 00" and ver. B, 0° 00' 00".
Note the deviation of the horizontal cross wire from the mark at first in
range with it.
Repeat the steps of this process till sure of the result shown. Leave
the transit so the telescope shows the deviation.
Correction.&gt; Set the line of sight midway between its two pointings,
by means of the slow motion to the transit axis. Set the verniers to.
read 0" 00' 00" and 180° 0' 0", or one at 0° 0' 00", and record the read-
ings of both. Fasten these last readings in the transit box.
Set the level to the verniers to read level, if there is one, after set-
ting them at 0° 00' 00" and 180° 00' 00" by their slow motion screw.
Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat the preparations, tests, cor-
rections, preparations, and tests, till the line of sight will strike the
same mark whichever side up the telescope may be, when the verniers
are set for a level line of sight, and the transit carefully levelled,—or
as nearly as can be to these conditions.
9. Line of Sight.
If a transit has a telescope level attached to its body tube,,
it being in adjustment with respect to the line of sight, and it is-
necessary to adjust the vertical cross wire, as in Sec. 2., some work
may be saved by levelling the transit for that adjustment with the
telescope level, setting the line of sight level and observing some mark
in line with the horizontal cross wire, before beginning the adjustment
of the vertical wire. After the vertical wire is adjusted set the horizon-
tal wire on the same mark, first seeing that the transit is as well levelled,,
as before, and adjust the telescope level to read level again, in case it.
needs it.
It is especially easy to derange the cross wires whenever all four
cross wire screws are loosened.
If the telescope level is a striding level it is so little work to adjust


the horizontal cross wire that it had better be done instead of depending
on any such device as is given above.
10. Centering the Eye Piece.
a. Eem. This is for the purpose of clear vision, as one might cen-
ter a magnifying glass more carefully over an object to be viewed. Fre-
quently there is no way provided for making this adjustment, and none
is needed.
b. Dir. Set up the transit where the telescope can be directed to
the light,—artificial light will do. By means of the four screws like, or
similar to the cross wire screws that hold the ring in the body tube of
the telescope, in which the inner end of the eye piece slides, set that
ring so the cross wires divide the field of view symmetrically.
tl. The Objective Slide.
a. Rem. No adjustment of the objective slide should be needed.
At this point the skill of the maker should be manifest. A test is given
below instead of an adjustment. This test will indicate how perfectly
the slide is fitted if the objective is well mounted, or how well the ob-
jective is mounted if the slide is well fitted. Two imperfections may be
present, or but one of them. An adjustment does not correct the dif-
ficulty. It partly hides it.
b. Dir. Set the transit where a row of stakes can be lined by it
without a motion of any kind except changing the focus of the objective.
Clamp the telescope securely with respect to all its motions. Line out
a row of stakes at measured intervals of 50 feet to 1,000 or 1,500 feet
away. Use a fore sight either at the end of the line or beyond it to keep
the transit steady by. Mark points on these stakes precisely in line and
at the measured distances apart, on line.
Move the transit to the other end of the line and by trial set it so the
line of sight covers the end marks, with no motion but focussing the
objective. Leave the telescope so clamped. Line a new set of pointsat
the same places as before. Note their deviations. There should benone,
theoretically.
This test is with respect to line. A similar test with respect to level
may be made by setting points on the sides of tall stakes in the line of
the horizontal cross wire. The horizontal cross wire cannot be easily
set to cover the end marks in the second position of the transit. Make
a new lir.e of marks. Measure the spaces between these and the first
ones carefully. They should vary as their horizontal distances from the
transit in its second position. J. B. Davis.

SAFETY FUSES.
In the development of the electrical industries, practice has almost
universally followed the lead of science and the men who have perfected
the electrical apparatus of today are very nearly without exception
scientific men The important features of the dynamo; the quantities
of copper and iron and their relative positions; the relation between
weight, output and cost of construction or efficiency of manufacture;
and the relation between selling price, expense of operation and of
maintainance, or efficiency of action; have all received elaborate con-
sideration at the hands of acknowledged scientists. A similar amount
of care and study has been given to the construction of the circuit and
the matter of the most economical size of wire for use under particular
conditions may be settled by the application of a law propounded by
the leading mathematical physicist of our day. But notwithstanding
the thought spent upon the more important parts of an electric system,
the details, those vitals of practice, have often been neglected by the
theorist and this probably from a variety of reasons. In the first place
they do not come to his notice; it is the practical man who is forced to
see the importance of details and when difficulties arise they must be
settled promptly, he has no time to wait for a scientific solution if not
absolutely necessary. But perhaps the principal reason is the fact that
a scientist will not spend his time on the solution of an uninteresting
and unimportant problem.
Of all the details which have suffered from.lack of scientific atten-
tion probably the fuse has the greatest cause for complaint. Its impor-
tance is paramount.for upon its accuracy depends not only the safety of
every part of the system and of every piece of apparatus but also
that of the building in which the wires or apparatus may be located.
On the other hand it might prove a very interesting subject for study
since its action is by no means as simple as it might appear to the casual
observer; nor as it has been made out to by articles published in some
of the electrical journals.
The fundamental principle of the fuse is indeed very simple. At
some convenient place a few inches of the circuit has its carrying
capacity very much reduced so that a rise of current of more or
less definite extent will open the circuit at this place by fusion of the


The Technic.
conductor, thus preventing injury to it at some inaccessable point.
Then with the recVuced portion of the circuit easily replacable we have
a convenient safety devise, and if proper attention is given to its man-
ufacture and a decent amount of intelligence is used in its application
it may be made sufficiently reliable for all commercial purposes.
But fuses are proverbially unreliable and when one consideres the
way in which they have been made and used, this is not in the least
remarkable. It has been said that the only difference between solder
and fuse wire is, that one costs ten cents a pound and the other a dol-
lar a pound. If a station manager is bothered by a fuse blowing out a
few times he is very apt to replace it by a larger one and if that gives
trouble a still larger one is substituted; and it is not impossible to find
record of cases in which Edison fuse sockets which have been poured full
of type metal, thus eliminating all trouble from the blowing of fuses.
Their unreliability is directly traceable to one or both of two causes;
first, ignorance or carelessness on the part of the manfacturer; second,
ignorance or carelessness on the part of the user. In the correction of
these evils, the manufacturer has the harder task: it is for him to
determine the best material to use; the best conditions and environ-
ments for the fuse, and its action not only under these, but under any
other combination of circumstances that may arise in practice. When
he has done this the consumer has only to follow directions and the
fuse will protect his plant from injury so far as excessive currents are
concerned.
In developing a system of fuses the manufacturer must depend
ultimately upon experiment. Formulas are not very difficult to con-
struct and they have appeared from time to time in the electrical jour-
nals, where they do very well; but their confirmation is quite another
matter and is not so simple, probably for a good reason.
Starting with fundamental principles; the fusing of any electrical
conductor, of indefinite length and uniform in material, cross section
and perimeter depends upon the following variable factors:
First. The current.
Second. The resistance of the conductor.
Third. Its melting temperature.
Fourth. Its emissivity.
Fifth. The amount of radiating surface.
Sixth. Its specific heat.
Seventh. Its mass.
Eighth. The length of time the current Hows.
Letting C=current.
i?=resistance.
S= surface.
M= mass.

we have L S ( Tm — To) = the maximum heat the conductor can dispose
of continuously without fusing; and since .24 CJ -R represents, the
heat continuously produced, the conductor will not fuse when

.24 C*R — L$( T„ — Ta) seconas- 1 aererore $1 C* R —LS ( Tm—T.)
= F is the fundamental equation for fusing of conductors. However,
in practice, as regards fuses, this equation is of little or no value. The
conditions there vary materially from these theoretical ones. The chief
difference is in the matter of length; instead of an indefinite length,we
have a few inches, or perhaps only a fraction of an inch, and the fuse
terminates on blocks of metal which help to keep it cool. It then be-
comes necessary to take account of the resistance to the flow of heat to
these terminals. Another difference is the wide variation in emissivity
with change of surface from bright to dull; with lead it is 137% greater
for a dull surface than for a polished one. Then there is the effect of
closed fuse boxes, which serve to interfere with free radiation and which
must be considered. Account must also be take of the mechanical
weakness of very small wire fuses and of very thin strip fuses. And
finally there is the very indefinite effect of a very uncertain amount of
oxydation which must not be forgotten.
On the other hand, such a general equation as the one developed
would be unnecessary since when once a particular material is adopted,
several of the variables become constants. In fact the only ones re-
maining of the original set are, the current, the time, the resistance and
the mass; and the last two may be expressed in terms of the diameter,
so we have to deal only with the current, diameter and time. But un-
fortunately the whole list of more uncertain variables is still to be con-
tended with, and it is these that disturb the calculations.
An equation called the " i power" formula appeared in one of the
electrical journals some times ago. It states that the current required
to melt a fuse varies with the § power of the diameter, or C= K D -§, K
being a constant. This, it is to be presumed, assumes that the length of
the fuse and of the time shall be taken the same in all cases. As a
matter of fact, a long series of experiments proved it to be false; per-
haps, if the length used varied with some function of the diameter, the
equation would hold true, but in such a case that element ought to be
embodied in the equation. C = K D2 agrees much more nearly with


67
the facts, but even with it, the variations in the value of K when figured
from the current and diameters of the experiments were more than
could be well charged to errors of observation; furthermore the variation
was in the nature of a steady increase with the increase in size of the
fuse, which showed that it was not due to accidental causes.
A formula connecting current and diameter when length and time
are constants, would be a very valuable one, and one connecting cur-
rent and length when diameter and time are constants would be almost
as useful, but after struggling with both problems for some time with-
out reaching a practical solution of either, the drawing of curves from
a series of experiments was resorted to. This method was very expen-
sive since it necessitated a storage battery capable of yielding 1000
amperes and an ammeter to measure this current, but it was one to be
relied upon implicitly and therefore of great value.
In all of the experiments the time was taken as one minute; that is,
the current that melted the fuse in one minute was the one accepted,
so the time did not enter as a variable. In making the tests enough
different sizes of wire were used to give a sufficient number of points to
make reliable curves ;and each size was used in five or six different lengths
and of each size and length from four to six samples were fused. The
results were embodied in three sets of curves and in each of the sets one
of the three variables, current, length or diameter was treated as a
constant. The curves on plate I are of that set in which a constant
length is used. Currents are plotted as ordinates increasing from the
bottom toward the top; diameters as abscissae, increasing toward the
right; and there is a seperate curve for each length. The curves on
plates II are of the set in which the diameter is a constant. Currents
are plotted the same way as on plate I but the abscissae represent lengths,
and there is a seperate curve for each diameter. In the set on plate
III the current is a constant; ordinates representing lengths and ab-
scissae, diameters; separate curves being drawn for each fusing current
used.
The deviation of the first set above a straight line is due largely, if
not entirely to the fact that as the diameter increases the ratio of length
to diameter decreases, which accounts for the carrying capacity of the
fuse increasing faster than the cross section. This effect is more clearly
shown by curves II, from which it appears that after the length of the
fuse falls below a fairly definite value, which might be called its critical
length, its carrying capacity increases very rapidly with further reduc-
tions. And the larger the fuse the sooner it makes this rapid upward
sweep.
Curves II, furthermore, emphasize the advisability of using fuses of
sufficient length ;#for if the length is sufficient to bring the fuse on the


The Technic.
part of the curve most nearly horizontal, a slight variation in its length
will make only a slight change in its carrying capacity, whereas if the
fuse is so short as to bring it on the more vertical part of the curve,
such a slight change may very materially alter its carrying capacity. It
is really of a great deal of importance that it be of sufficient length, since
the element of uncertainty may thereby be greatly reduced, and it is
essential that uncertainty in a safety device be reduced to a minimum.
The present tendency is to shorten them, and it has already been car-
ried to such an extent that the regulation of their length, by legislation
or by the insurance companies, would increase the certainty of their
action, and therefore their reliability.
Plate III contains curves which are of great convenience in making
up wire into terminal fuses, for, in orders for these, a regular carrying
capacity is usually called for, that is, one which is some multiple of
5, while the lengths are very irregular, depending on the shape and size
of the terminals. These curves amount to an interpolation between
those of Plates I and II.
Some hard things have been said against fuses because of the dif-
ference between the current required to fuse them instantaneously (so
called) and that required to fuse them in some definite length of time;
the argument being that in order to have the fuse carry a given current
safely and continuously, it must be so large that it will carry without
melting a very much larger current for a short time. But it should be
remembered that the other parts of the circuit are subject to the same
general laws with regard to heating and melting, as the fuse is, and, that
a dangerous current is not fully described by stating the number of
amperes, but the length of time it lasts must be added. In any event,
the fuse is the weakest part of the circuit by hypothesis, and therefore
must be the first to give way.
There is one case in which the criticism is a just one; it is where a
fuse is the ultimate protection to the dynamo and engine. Then a
short circuit on the line may injure the engine, belts or pulley ; may
twist the armature shaft or displace the windings before the fuse has
time to melt. For such a purpose a fuse is out of place, and magnetic
circuit breakers are generally used. In general, a safety device should
be similar in nature to that which it is to protect; a fuse cannot be ex-
pected to protect a steam engine. An engine may suffer as much from
a sudden decrease of load as from a sudden increase, for in the former
case a sudden rise in speed may result, followed by the bursting of a Hy
wheel and its attendant destruction.
In experimenting on fuses with copper terminals a Peltier effect
was looked for, but the fact that they all gave way in the middle would


69
indicate that it was comparatively very sight; for since, in case the
terminal blocks are heavy enough, the fuse melts ultimately on account
of its inability to conduct to the terminals the heat generated in it, it
gets hottest in the center and breaks there; if, however, the Peltier
effect exerted an appreciable influence on the temperature, the fuse
would give way nearer one end than the other, since one junction would
be heated and the other cooled by the passage of the current. In one
case the circuit was opened just before the fuse was ready to break;
'the inside of it had become either very soft or else molten, and a very
delicate but well-defined crease had formed around it exactly halfway
between the terminals, showing with precision which had been the
hottest part.
In spite of this fact, it does not seem at all impossible that with
proper care a fuse should be made depending for its action on the Pel-
tier effect. From a commercial standpoint its value would probably be
small and its field of usefulness limited, since it could hardly compete
with the ordinary fuse; yet it might find application in places where the
other would be useless, as, for instance, preventing the flow of a current
in a particular direction, or opening the circuit in case the direction of
the current became reversed ;—protection which is valuable in electro-
plating and in the charging of storage batteries. Whatever value it
might have commercially, it would certainly prove an interesting sub-
ject for investigation.
Judging the fuse from its past record we must certainly acknowl-
edge that, even in its crude condition, it has occupied a place in elec-
trical engineering which no other device was capable of filling, and with
more care given to its manufacture and a greater amount of intelligence
used in its application, it will doubtless be able to hold the place as a
circuit protector under the more exacting conditions of future installa-
tions which it has held in those less elaborate ones of the past.

HEATING A SHOP FOR NOTHING.
In the consideration of this seemingly difficult problem, it is not
proposed to arrive at conclusions by any abstruse calculations at this
time, for in these the new graduate would be more skillful, in all prob-
ability, than we who have been a few years away from college walls.
It is not forgotten that it has been said in the pages of this periodical
that the acquisition of facts alone is of no value. I have some misgiv-
ings, therefore, in presenting the following bare-faced facts. Still, a
few practical results will not prove uninteresting, I hope, and especially
as the subject yields readily to theory.
The heating of large shops is a very important question, and usually
a very expensive one; and since in these days of sharp competition the
difference between success and failure is often only the cumulative
effect of a number of small leaks in management, the cutting down of
expense in this department is a very satisfactory step in the right direc-
tion. Let us see what can be done by employing the exhaust steam
from an engine for heating.
In the plant of which we propose to speak, all the power is trans-
mitted by a Eeynold's-Corliss engine of 150 H.P. capacity. A series of
cards taken under conditions of maximum load, demonstrates, how-
ever, that 105 H.P. is all that is ever required, and the average of a large
number of cards with the ordinary work in progress is 82 H.P. A calcu-
lation of the water consumption shows about 35 lbs of steam per H. P.
per hour, or about 28,700 pounds per day. In the blacksmith shop is a
steam hammer, also contributing to the supply. Unfortunately it can-
not be stated exactly how much steam this hammer uses, but from com-
parisons of coal used when the hammer is running and when it is not,
it may fairly be assumed that an average of 2,000 lbs. of steam passes
through the hammer in ten hours. This, then, is the amount of steam
we have with which to heat the shop, approximately 3.000 pounds per
hour. The boiler pressure is kept at 75 lbs., and the inspection of a large
number of cards shows the back pressure to vary from 0 lbs. to 4 lbs.,
with an average of about 2 lbs. There seems to be no connection
between the high back pressure and the increased H.P. as heavy loads
are thrown on the engine, the capacity of the piping seeming to be
ample; but when the steam hammer was used for long periods of time
the back pressure rose, sometimes as high as 4 lbs.


71
The sizes of the various shops are as follows: A carpenter shop
53' X 5C X 25', with two walls exposed to the weather. There is in this
shop about 250 feet of heating surface in \" pipe placed in long coils
along the wall. A foundry 50' X 150' X 20' high, three of the walls
being outside; but a large number of skylights, some of which are con-
tinually open for ventilation, makes this a hard shop to heat. There is
fully 1,000 sq. ft. of surface distributed around the walls of this shop.
An erecting shop 140' X 120' and about 28' high, almost the whole of
which is glass, and one long wall exposed to the weather. There is in
the shop about 1,150 sq. ft. of heating surface distributed around the
walls and in a series of coils down the center of the shop. There are
two floors of a machine shop each 98' X 47' and about 15' high, each
floor supplied with about 500 ft. of surface. Across the street from the
engine room, and supplied with steam through an underground tunnel,
is another machine shop 90' X 270'. The central portion for a width of
40' i9 about 38' high, while the wings are 15' high. There is about 2.700
sq. ft. of surface in 2" pipe extending the full length of the shop in
either wing. There are also six offices with about 60 sq. ft. in each one.
All of the shops, except the large machine shop last named, were orig-
inally piped for live steam, with 1" pipe in all coils, as the old coils
were used ; and this caused some fear as to the amount of back pres-
sure that would be produced on this account.
The following is a brief description of the system: The main engine
exhausts into a six-inch pipe with the valves so arranged that the ex-
haust may be turned directly out of doors, through the feed water
heater or through the heating pipes, the condensed steam being all col-
lected in a tight hotwell, from which it is pumped back into the boiler
when the heating coils are in use. The various shops are made inde-
pendent of each other, and an attempt was made to divide the lengths of
pipe on any one system so that the water may be returned at as nearly
210° F. as possible. One system has on it about 100 ft. of 6" pipe, 100
ft. of 4", 3,500 ft. of 2", and about 1,600 ft. of 1", while in another is
about 7,000 ft. of 1" pipe, though this is rather too much. The feeders
for the various shops, and the return to the hotwell, are of 2J" pipe.
There is no sort of condensing arrangement in the hotwell, though I
think it would be a valuable addition. A relief valve js fixed on the hot-
well jet so it will relieve at 2 pounds. Live steam pipes 1J" in diameter
are run direct from the boilers to each main feed pipe at a point as near
the coils as possible. This is only used daily, in the morning to warm
the coils up before the engine starts; but no bad effects have been pro-
duced by mixing live and exhaust steam on very cold days when found
necessary, care being taken not to run the back pressure up too high.
It is quite important in starting that all coils have liberal openings for
escape of air, also large pipes to drain main feed pipes and return


The Technic.
water easily to tank when starting the engine. All the return pipes run
through an oil extractor, as the constant accumulation of oil in the
boilers is very destructive to the sheets. The tank used is about 3' X V
X 6', and arranged with a float operating the valve admitting steam to
the pump which supplies the boiler from the hotwell. This, of course,
is quite necessary, obviating the constant attention that would other-
wise have to be given it. The returned water is nearly sufficient to sup-
ply the boiler, it being necessary to admit water to the tank from out-
side sources only about ten minutes each day, to make up for leaks,
steam blown out through vents and the tank relief valve.
Mention should be made of the noticeable difference in the condi-
tion of the boiler after a few weeks run with this system. No accumu-
lation of scale whatever could be found, the dirt being soft and, of
course, oily, and easily blown out of the boiler
Much has been said regarding the loss coming from the increased
back pressure incident to this method of heating, indeed I have seen ap-
peals to the calculus with results that would discourage any innovations
of this kind; but a few figures with dollar signs annexed might aid us
in our conclusions. The drain in this power plant is so nearly uniform
that, as far as practical results go, comparisons may safely be made
between different weeks The cold weather, with the call for heavy
firing in the heating boiler, started last season with the first of Decem-
ber, and the piping for the use of exhaust steam not being completed,
the shops were heated in the old manner till the middle of January.
For the week ending Dec. 10th, 1892, the average daily cost of operating
the plant, including coal, oil, and labor, was $17.37 ; for the succeeding
weeks, including the week ending with January 14th, it was $18.60,
117.80, $18.07, $18.07, and $18.58. The following week was largely an
experimental one, with the new system in operation a portion of the
time only, but the daily average dropped to $15.36. For the eight suc-
ceeding weeks the average daily costs were, respectively, $14.33, $14.60
$14.68, $14.60, $14.35, $13.64, $13.53, and $13.96. This shows the invest-
ment in pipe to have been a profitable one, and when we still further
consider that the effect on the boiler is so beneficial, and that we are
enabled to shut one boiler down entirely, there seems to be but little
chance foi objection to the system, at least from a financial standpoint.

ELEVATION OF THE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD
TRACKS.
The right of way of the Illinois Central Railroad extends along the
shore of Lake Michigan from the Chicago terminus at Lake street to
Forty-seventh street, a distance of about five miles. Thence it begins
to diverge from the lake shore passing through one of the most desira-
ble residence parts of the city which is well populated about as far south
as Sixty-seventh street.
South of Sixty-seventh street are numerous suburban points on the
main line and on branches running
to South Chicago and Blue Island
which are about twelve and sixteen
miles respectively from the city.
The suburban traffic on the main
line is carried on as far south as
Homewood, which is twenty-five
miles from the city.
Seventy trains are run daily each
way between the city and Sixty-
seventh street at which points some
of these trains branch off for South
Chicago, while others leave the main
line further south for Blue Island
the remainder continuing to the end
of the suburban route on the main
line.
The commutation traffic of this
road is the largest in the United
States, the number of passengers
carried on its suburban line during
the year ending June 30th, 1892 be-
ing 7,945,937. During the year 1887
4,828,128 passengers were carried
thus showing that the suburban
traffic has increased over fifty per
cent, in the past five years. During


The Technic.
the continuance of the World's Fair through trains will be run, at
two minute intervals from the city to Jackson Park.
For this World's Fair traffic, which is separate from the regular
suburban service, trains of ten cars, carrying about one thousand people
per train will be used, making the number carried per hour thirty
thousand. The cars were made especially for the purpose, the seats
being arranged as in ordinary open street cars. •
The economy" of time in unloading these trains will be evident when
it is said that from the time the train stops until it is drawn off empty
but thirty seconds elapse.
The regular suburban service will accommodate twenty thousand
people per hour thus making it possible to transport fifty thousand
people per hour to the World's Fair site.
If the tracks had remained at grade and this enormous traffic been
carried on it would have been well-nigh impossible for vehicles or
pedestrians to have attempted to cross them without the most fatal re-
sults.
In view of these facts and in order to provide for the future use of
the streets intersecting the right of way without grade crossings, the
elevation of the tracks from Fifty-first to Sixty-seventh street was under-
taken.
Actual field operations were begun about the 20th, of June 1892.and
construction has since been pushed to completion, in accordance with
an ordinance passed by the city council of Chicago May 23rd, 1892. The
work has thus required about one year.
The elevation of the finished roadbed is 20.5 feet above city datum
while the average elevation of the old roadbed was 10.5 thus making the
embankment about ten feet in height.
Approach grades beginning at Forty-seventh and Seventy-first,
streets connect the old roadbed with the elevated at Fifty-first and
Sixty-seventh streets, the gradient used being .3 of one per cent.
The embankment is of sand which was brought from a point in
Indiana near the lake shore, about twenty-six miles from the city.
The cars used in transporting the sand are similar to ordinary coal
cars and contain from thirty to thirty-two cubic yards, which is about
four or five times as much as flat cars ordinarily carry.
About six or eight inches of gravel was used for ballasting.
The roadbed will accommodate ten tracks for which the whole of
the two hundred foot right of way is used,excepting about forty feet on
the west side, on which are located the stations. These are left on the
lower level in their original positions, retaining walls having been built
in front of them to hold the embankment. Two stairways at each
station for reaching the elevation are built in openings in the abutments.


At the street intersections plate girders, supported by columns and
masonry abutments, admit of the roadways and sidewalks being carried
beneath the tracks.
The abutments are locatad on the property lines of streets where
there are no stations, but where there are stations the abutments are set
back of the property lines from forty to fifty feet. The space thus left
under the girders between the abutments and sidewalks is available for
extra ticket offices of the company or as rentable ground for stores,
stands, etc. On each curb line there is a row of columns spaced the
same distance apart as the tracks, being thirteen feet center to center
except where stairways occur, when the distance is twenty-six feet.
The distance between curb lines varies from forty to fifty feet ac-
cording to the widths of streets.
In general there are at street crossings three spans of eleven girders
each, the central span, extending between the two rows of columns,
being about forty feet in length while the side span extending from the
columns to the abutments,are from forty to fifty feet in length on some
streets and from ten to fifteen feet on others according to the location
of abutments as noted above.
The streets are lowered about three or three and one half feet on
the right of way and are connected with the original street surfaces by
slopes of one foot in (wenty-five beginning at the right of way lines.
All depressed roadways and slopes are macadamized and a proper
system of sewage is instituted ; also seven to ten foot sidewalks are built
on the right of way and on slopes where old walk has been disturbed ,
all of which is done and to be maintained at the expense of the rail-
road company.
At the Midway Plaisance which extends from 59th St. to 60th St.
the tracks are carried on pile trestle. This is only temporary and will
be replaced by embankment and girders after the World's Fair. Ex-
tensive preparations have been made here, for the handling of the
World's Fair traffic and for the passage of crowds beneath the tracks,
but the limits of this article will not permit further detail.
The abutments at all streets consist of five courses of Bedford lime-
stone, resting on two and one-half feet of concrete. Foundations for
the columns are of concrete, three and one-half feet thick, surmounted
by 3' X 3' cap stones fifteen inches thick. Hollow castings, in size
about 12" X 18" and two and one-half to four feet high, are bolted to
the cap stones, the bolts extending down into the concrete about two
feet.
The columns are set in these castings which are then tilled with
cement,thus solidly encasing the lower three or four feet of the columns
protecting them from damage.


The Technic
Between the castings rubble retaining walls are built. They serve
to retain the earth between sidewalk and curb separating the roadway
from the walk,which is generally about two or three feet above the level
of the street.
Louisville cement was used in all concrete and masonry except in
the coping of abutments where the Broken Range Ashlar was employed
and in the side walks which were laid in Portland.
The columns were made of 6J" X 3|" X \" Z bars rivetted to 8"
X iV' plates. Cross frames of Z" X 3" X \" angles serve for lateral
bracing. All material in girders and columns is of steel.
The floor system is solid being composed of a series of steel troughs
semi-hexagonal in shape rivetted together as shown in the section. The
ties are set in a composition of asphalt and coal tar which is sloped at
the end of the ties to allow the water to pass through small holes one
inch in diameter at each end of every trough.
Gutters under the girders convey the water to downspouts which are
carried down the sides of columns and abutments emptying into sewers-
The wooden pieces, shown under the rail on top of the inverted
troughs were used as bearings for the rail while the asphalt was being
put in and were taken out as soon as the ties were given their full bear-
ing.
The tinal estimate shows that about 6,000 cubic yards of Ashlar
mosonry have been used in the work; also 2,000 cubic yards of Rubble
masonry, 650 cubic yards of Broken Range Ashlar and 4,000 cubic yards
of Louisville cement concrete.
Over 50,000 cubic yards of earth were excavated for abutment and
pier foundations and in street lowering.
The embankment required 24,000 cubic yards of sand. The estimated
total cost of the elevation of tracks was $1,360,000.

THE ELECTRIC SUBWAY AT THE COLUMBIAN
EXPOSITION.
H. G. FIELD, CLASS OF '93.
The electric subway was designed and built to contain the electric
conductors for supplying current from dynamos in the power plant in
Machinery Hall to lights and motors in most of the exposition buildings.
From the standpoint of aesthetics, rather than for economy or con-
venience, it was desirable to avoid the unsightly stringing of overhead
lines. The use of underground conductors has opened up a new branch
of work for electrical engineers, hence much interest has been mani-
fested at the project of burying all the wires at this great exposition
where 17,000 horse power of electric energy is to be used.
Recourse was naturally had to an underground system of ducts or
conduits, in consequence of which more than 100 miles of " pump log"
ducts have been laid, forming a network about the grounds. The aver-
age depth of
these ducts be-
low the surface
of the earth is
14 inches, and
to give access to
the wires, the
ducts are inter-
cepted at fre-
quent intervals
by wooden box-'
es provided
with cast iron
covers. These
boxes are made
of 2-inch plankj
18J inches
square in plan, and 12 inches or 24 inches deep according to service re-
quired, the former being for incandescent, the latter for arc light cir- ■
Fig. 1.


The Technic.
&lt;;uits. Large holes are bored in^the bottom of each box to provide for
drainage.
It might be readily inferred that, where electricity is to be supplied
to so many lights, it would be necessary to
run many feeders together over long dis-
tances, and since a tunnel or subway would
provide greater convenience and accessibility
for so many wires, that method was early
adopted.
The subway was therefore made in order
to accommodate the several groups of con-
ductors running from Machinery Hall to
each of the following buildings: Mines and
Mining, Electricity, Manufactures and Liber-
al Arts, Government, and Fisheries. The en-
tire length of this underground tunnel or
subway is about J \ miles, and the cross sec-
tion varies with the number of conduct-
ors.
The route of the subway is in general as follows: From under
Machinery Hall the course is northward as a double tunnel of cross
■section as shown in *Fig 1, each section being about 6£ feet square,
inside measurement, and separated by a 10-inch wall common to both.
•For the plates used in Illustrating this article, the writer is indebted to Mr.
JTred DeLand of Chicago, editor of World's Fair Electrical Engineering.


These sections will hereafter be designated the East and West Divis-
ions. Before reaching the Electricity Building, the West Division
branches into two separate tunnels, each 6J feet high and 4J feet broad,
as shown in Fig. 2. One of these branches of the West Division con-
tinues northward to the Electricity Building, the other runs westward
and ends at the Mines Building. Near this point where the West Divis-
ion branches, the entire East Division (see Fig. 3) turns eastward to the
bridge which crosses the North Canal southeast of the Electrical Build-
ing. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate how special provision is made for the
wires to pass on the under side of the bridge. From this bridge the
subway continues eastward to the southwest corner of the Manufac-
tures Building, thence northward under the brick pavement of the
west loggia of the Manufactures Building. Two branches, one near the
southwest corner, the other near the center of this building, lead under
its floor and terminate in open ends. The main subway continues under
the loggia for the entire length of this building, and along the west half
of the north end, also under the loggia, thence northward to the North
Inlet Bridge, passing under the entire length of the Government Build-
ing in its course. Special wiring, similar in principle to that shown in
Figures 5 and 6 but for fewer wires, is resorted to at this bridge also.
From this bridge the subway extends northward and terminates under
the Fisheries Bulding.
The subway north of the Manufactures Building is only 4 feet 5
inches high by 4 feet 3 inches
broad, inside measurement. A
longitudinal vertical section of this
subway is shown at the right in
Fig. 4, the left hand portion being
a similar section for the remainder
of the subway. Throughout most
of its length the top of the subway
is covered with earth to an average
depth of 18 inches.
The construction of the sub-
way is, in general, of rectangular
frames of 3-inch by 8-inch timber
having corner joints mitred, and
stiffened by 2-inch plates spiked
on. These frames, comprising the
sills, studs, and joists, are placed 1
foot center to center, and are covered on, all sides by 2-inch by 10-inch
planks laid longitudinally and breaking joints. The planking used on
Fig. 3.


The Technic.
the sides and top is matched and grooved, and all joints are filled with
white lead and oil to make them watertight. The specifications called
for the sides and top to be entirely coated outside with tar. Owing to
the extreme cold weather at the time of building, tar would not run
freely, and was consequently omitted. To make a floor in the subway,
sand was first tamped in between the sills to a depth of 6 inches. On
top of the sand, concrete was laid to a depth of 3 inches at the center
and 5 inches at the sides, making a slope for drainage. A layer of
cement 1 inch thick was then laid on the concrete, thus making a firm
and smooth floor. The walls and ceiling were then covered with tar
paper, over which expanded metal lath was laid to hold the Acme
cement plaster. The entire subway is therefore to a great extent fire
proof, being built of heavy timber embedded in the earth and lined
with cement.
For mechanical strength, the amount of material in the subway is
probably in excess of any load to which it will be subjected. As evi-
dence for this statement, suffice to say that a 12-ton road roller has
crossed and recrossed the subway at various portions of the ground,
without appreciably affecting the subway either by deflection or dis-
tortion.
Previous mention has been made of the special and somewhat com-
plicated system of wiring required at the approaches to the two bridges.
It may be remarked in passing, that special framing construction was
necessarily adopted at these points of the subway. At the largest of
these fan-shaped bridge approaches (see Figs. 5 and 6) the greatest
breadth is 38 feet 10 inches, and the greatest depth is 9 feet 2 inches.
The joists used in the roof of this structure are 4 by 10 inches.
All the wiring, though special, is in general very simple. The fol-
lowing description will serve to explain the construction and methods
employed. The cross arms are of special straight grained, dry seasoned
oak, 2£ inches deep, 4 inches wide, and 3 feet long. Each cross arm has
five pinholes 1£ inches diameter, accurately bored, 5£ inches from cen-
ter to center. These cross arms are supported by cast iron uprights,
being driven to place and held rigidly by means of oak wedges. The
sockets which hold the cross arms are 5 inches deep, and special care
was taken in placing the cores for the casting to keep the lower bearing
surface horizontal. The uprights are placed in pairs as shown in Fig.
4, and about 30 feet apart. In Fig. 3 may be seen a section showing
this method of supporting the cross arms. To guard against splitting,
each cross arm is pierced near its outer end by a f-inch carriage bolt,
provided with a large washer at each end. The insulators are of glass
of the large groove, double petticoat, standard size. They are held
clear of the cross arms a uniform distance of J inch by means of special


81
6rVinch split oak pins. The staggered arrangement of cross arms
shown in Fig. 4 is intended to economize space by allowing wires sup-
ported upon insulators on any of the lower cross arms to pass close
Fig. 7.


The Technic.
under, but free from contact with, the cross arm next above. Another
advantage of this arrangement is the facility offered for the placing or
removing of insulators. The wires on each cross arm are on 5J-inch
centers, and each wire is 11J inches above the nearest wire directly
below, though only 5J inches vertically above the wires on the next
lower cross arm. That is, the wires are in staggered arrangement sim-
ilar to that of the cross arms. Consequently should a wire be loosed
from its support, it must sag about 11J inches before touching another
wire below, whereas, were the wires not staggered a sag of about 5|
inches would bring the insulation of the two wires in contact. Even in
such an event, since the conductors are provided with a high grade of
insulation, no harm would ordinarily result.
Considerable trouble in arrangement of wires was anticipated at
Fig. 5.
turns in the subway, but the scheme shown in Fig. 7 was finally devised.
Several points in this method are worthy of special notice. First: At a
Tight angle turn such as at G, all wires, though relatively changed in
position at the turn, return to their original position; that is, if adjacent
to the wall before reaching the the turn, they are again adjacent after
passing. Second: Between the supports at the turn the wires have the
same staggered arrangement as elsewhere. Third: The only crossing
of wires is between two points of support that are close together, instead
of crossing on long spans. Fourth: In all cases th# strain from the
wire comes directly "upon the insulator, never on the tie wire. Fifth:
The bend in wires is slight, being only 45° from a straight line in max-
imum cases.
It has been remarked that the special wiring at the bridge ap-
proaches, as shown in the vertical section in Fig. 5 and the horizontal


section in Fig. 6, is somewhat complicated. The limited allowable
depth for wires under the bridge made it necessary to devise some spe-
cial arrangement here. To prove that the method illustrated was all
right, the writer constructed a model and showed by it that all wires


The Technic.
diverge in actual distance apart, beginning at the slanting cross arm
support and ending at the support for wires at the bridge abutment, as
shown at the left of the drip loops in Fig. 5. The plan view shows only
the wires from the upper four cross arms, and is intended as a diagram
to illustrate the method, a portion of each wire being omitted. The
cross arms are numbered from 1 to 12, counting from the top down, and
the insulators on each arm are numbered from 1 to 5, counting from
the aisle to the wall. In the fan-shaped portion of Fig. 5, the upper
four wires, if produced, would connect with the insulators numbered 5
on each of these four upper cross arms respectively, the number of the
cross arm to which a wire belongs being indicated by its relative length,
the longest wire belongs to cross arm number 1 in each group of four
wires. The next group of four wires belong to insulator number 4, and
follow the same order relative to cross arms as do the first four, that is
1—3-2—4.
Fig. 8.
When it is desired to run branch circuits from feeders in the sub-
way into ducts, the plaster on the wall, adjacent to a cast iron upright
near the desired point of exit for the taps, is made to follow the outline
of the framing in such a manner as to form a pocket or bay in the wall,


in which to run the lead covered tap lines from the ducts above down
to the level of the feeder. A similar method was also proposed by the
writer for crossing wires from one side of the subway to the other,
across the center aisle.
I
Fig. 10.


The Technic.
Space has been left between the bottom cross arnls and the floor in
which to run, telephone, telegraph, and fire alarm cables.
Water has often accumulated at the low points of the subway to a
depth of from 6 to 12 inches. A complete drainage system, to be oper-
ated by centrifugal pumps run by electric motors, was advocated and
designed, but never instituted.
It is expected that the natural draught in the subway, due to its
open ends and frequent manholes (about every 350 feet), will provide
sufficient ventilation.
The subway is brilliantly lighted throughout by means of incan-
descent lamps near the ceiling, there being one lamp for every 30 feet
of length of subway. The wires which conduct current to these lamps
are fastened to porcelain knob insulators screwed to the ceiling joists.
The total capacity of the subway, on a basis of one wire per insula-
tor, is almost 100 miles. Should the capacity of the subway be over-
taxed, recourse will be had to suitable size of the special type, two
wire, double petticoat insulator. This type of insulator allows the use
of a separate and independent tie wire for each wire supported. The
form of this insulator is clearly shown by Figures 8, 9, and 10. It was
designed by Mr. E. H. Pierce, Electrical Engineer for the Columbian
Exposition. Great credit is due Mr. Pierce for the able manner in which
he has managed the Electrical Department of the Pair, assisting cheer-
fully even in the minor details, though obliged to devote his con-
centrated attention upon the more momentous problems constantly
presented.

THE DIVISION ENGINEER.
This is an old and hackneyed subject but I may be able to give a
few points that are not generally included in the duties of the Division
Engineer, which if carried out, would be a permanent benefit to the
company which employs him. I am aware of the different titles in differ-
ent parts of the country or even on different roads in the same section
for one and the same man. Assistant Engineer, Besident Engineer,
Division Engineer and some other titles are given to the man we are dis-
posed to call "Division Engineer" or the one who has immediate charge of
the construction of a division varying in length from six to twenty miles.
His duties may be briefly outlined as follows: To check the alignment
and levels when he first takes the division, to cross-section the work, to lay
out bridges, trestles, culverts (unless there is an engineer especially for
that purpose), to watch the progress of the work, calculate quantities at
leisure, make monthly estimates, give finishing grades and finally to
wind up by making the final estimate.
The first thing mentioned in the above duties is not always required
by the railroad company, but it should never be neglected. If time is
limited, the line need not be all measured for it is hard for a one station
error to creep into the location. If the transit party makes a mistake
of that kind the level party is almost sure to detect it. If the line is all
measured it will be found very convenient to make a note of plusses
wanted in cross-sectioning. The notes can then be kept continuous in
the field book without wasting space or without having to double up.
(Space sufficient for grade points, points between cuts and fills, should
be left in their proper places; this can be done by consulting the profile.)
This taking note of plusses would not be so necessary if an engineer
could lay out all his work before contractors came to bother him. But
how many engineers ever get all their work done continuously? As a
rule there are a half dozen or more contractors scattered over the entire
division clamoring for work all at the same time.
The transit line should be very carefully re-run to see that no
swings have been made in long tangents and that the curves are cor-
rectly located. Both of these are hard to rectify after the road-bed is
constructed. In Texas I saw a series of swings in a long tangent that in
16 miles amounted to fully 150 feet; that is, the first tangent produced


The Technic.
would strike 150 feet from the tangent 16 miles ahead. This was in
perfectly flat country where the entire tangent was visible from the
beginning. This was probably caused by using a transit a few minutes
out of adjustment and by keeping the same side ahead all the time.
The swings occurred uniformly about 2U0O feet apart which showed the
length of sights used.
Check levels should always be run to see that no mistakes of one
foot or more have been made. These mistakes are as liable to occur on
maximum grades as any other place and if not detected before work is
commenced are liable to cause serious trouble. It is not a hard matter
to make mistakes of one foot when running levels hurridly; 3.85 could
very easily be called 4.85 for the 4 foot mark is the one naturally looked
at. But probably the easiest place for a novice to read wrong is on the
back of an extension rod where the reading is done in the opposite
direction from the front reading: 1 once discovered a ten foot error on
the profile, by remembering the lay of the land, where the levelman
and rodman had both passed it over. In rough work this may happen
without any one discovering it unless check levels are run. This might
cause serious trouble during construction. It is well at this time to
establish temporary bench-marks not more than 1000 feet apart for con-
venience in cross-sectioning and giving grades.
Reference Points: -The ends of curves and summits of grades on
tangents should be referenced for accuracy in running centers for grades
and track and for future reference. To be of value to the maintenance
of way department, these points should be of a permanent character.
Probably the best materials for this purpose are stone, lead and copper.
If there is good stone on the division, these stone points can be put in
without costing the company anything extra. There is generally time
after the lirst rush of cross-sectioning is over in which the ax men can
find time to do the work of preparing these stone. They should be
about (i to 10 inches square, 2 to 3 feet long with a half to three-quarter
inch hole drilled in the top, this hole rilled with lead and a copper nail
driven into the center of the lead. These should be placed out of reach
of the graders and outside of probable extensions such as double track-
ing etc., and still be kept inside the right-of-way. Probably the best
system is to use four stones placed on two lines intersecting at the point
to be referenced. These lines should be as nearly at right angles to
each other as the ground will permit, measurements taken from the
center to each point and the angles between the different lines taken.
This will enable one to re-locate the center if one or even two of the
points should be destroyed. These stones should be placed well under
the surface with a large Hat stone placed on top coming flush with the
surface of the ground. The reason for being so careful with these


89
points is that they will be used so long as the alignment remains un-
changed. Any maintenance of way engineer who has had to retrace
the old line for any purpose, will agree with me that this is very impor-
tant. In a great many cases it is impossible to run the tangents to an
intersection and other methods are tedious and unsatisfactory unless
very great care is used. When stones can not be obtained pieces of rail-
road iron or metal stakes of some kind should be used, for wood at best
will last only a few years.
Permanent Bench-Marks should be of stone similar to reference
points and should be placed with the same care. They should be at
about the elevation of the grade opposite and, if placed about a half
mile apart, will be found close enough for all purposes. In a settled
country, water-tables of buildings, bridge piers or any permanent struc-
tures make good bench-marks. These should be referred to a sea level
elevation where it is possible to obtain it. These bench-marks can be
put in at any time but probably the best time to run the .final levels,
which should be done with the greatest care, is after the road-bed is
about completed and equal sights be taken to insure accurate work.
The original bench-marks should be referred to this new set of levels so
a corrected profile can be made.
Another thing I must speak of is drainage to protect the road-bed.
On a large amount of work I have seen, the road-bed has been built
with an utter disregard of the effect of rain upon it. In many cases the
borrow pits can be so arranged as to give sufficient protection to the
embankment without any additional cost. But without regard to cost,
surface ditches should be made so they will in the best manner protect
the road-bed in both cuts and fills. The effect of this neglect is seen in
the maintenance in after years. The period of construction is not only the
natural time for this work but it can be done much cheaper -then than
afterwards.
Looking up section corners, running land lines not obtained cor-
rectly during location and tying the same to the center line would
naturally come under the division engineer.
After the road-bod is completed and before the track is laid the line
should be carefully remeasured checking with a sufficient number of
the original stations so that a map and profile may be made, showing
the corrected line and levels. If possible, this should start at the be-
ginning of the road or where it joins another part of the road and be
kept continuous. This of course would necessitate each engineer com-
pleting his division before the next one could take it up. Good stout
stakes made of wood that will last longest in the ground, the upper part
painted white with black figures or with figures burned in, should be put
firmly in the ground 1000, 2000 feet or a half mile apart marking the


The Technic.
station number. These stakes should be placed far enough to one side
of the center, say eight or ten feet, so they will not be disturbed in lay-
ing the track or ballasting.
The above described bench-marks, station stakes, reference points,,
etc., will be found almost indispensible in keeping a correct record of
changes made after the construction of the road.
Each division engineer should be furnished with a book of conven-
ient size, say 1" x 10//, leaves of first quality paper, properly ruled and
be required to make a record of the work as follows. 1st.: Transit
notes, alignment, topography, etc., showing carefully all land connec-
tions, right of way, all streams original and as changed and such other
notes as might be termed transit notes. The station column should be
double using one for location stations and the other with ink of differ-
ent color for corrected measurements. 2nd: All notes that belong to
the cross-section book including quantities or excavation, embankment,
ditches, etc., foundation excavation, masonry, bridging, etc.. with notes
in the margin showing disposition of material and all other notes fully
explaining the manner of doing the work. This should be by sections;,
the cross-section notes of each section being immediately followed by
sectional summaries of the clearing, grubbing, grading, masonry, bridg-
ing and other notes, closing with the final estimate.
A very convenient size for office maps is sheets about 22" x 42/A
scale 200 ft. per inch although with a scale of 100 ft. per inch, all details-
of buildings, platforms etc. etc., can be shown, but probably the better
plan is to make the line plats on a scale of 200 ft. or 400 ft. per inch
with station plats on a larger scale showing details. The profiles should
be put on the line plats.
I have endeavored to outline above a few of the things that division
engineers are not usually required to do, yet they naturally come
under the duties of that man who has the time, notes, and opportun-
ity to do such work; this work being indispensible for keeping correct
notes and for the maintenance of a first-class road.

1. MOMENTS OF INERTIA OF A PLANE SECTION.
There are two classes of moments of inertia; equatorial and polar.
Equatorial moments are those about axes in the plane of the figure.
Polar moments are those about axes perpendicular to the plane
of the figure. The polar moment of a section about a given axis-
is equal to the sum of the equatorial moments about two chosen axea
intersecting at right angles in the given polar axis.
If upon each of every pair of lines intersecting at right angles in a.
point of a plane figure, we lay off from the point of intersection dis-
tances equal to the radius of gyration of the section about the other as
an axis, the points so determined will lie in the so-called Momental
Ellipse of the Section for that point, the major and minor axes of which
will be proportional to the maximum and minimum equatorial moments,
the semi-axes being equal to the radii of gyration.
If we call the maximum and minimum radii of gyration a and b
respectively, the equation of the momental ellipse referred to its own
axes, becomes a1 x1 + 6' y2 = k2 or in the most simple form if k = a b-t
6» + a&gt;~ ■
By this supposition the radius of gyration for the moment about a
chosen axis is equal to the distance of the axis from a tangent to the
momental ellipse parallel to the axis. The equation of a tangent to an
ellipse at a point xt yx being + ^« = 1 in which x and y are
the current •oordinates of the tangent and a and b are the semi-axes of
the ellipse.
If Im and Iy designate the equatorial moments for a pair of
coordinate axes then the angle &lt;p0 between the axis of abscissas and the-
minor axis of the ellipse is given by the equation:
tan 2 &lt;p„ = V f^'!_ j m which A is the area of the section.
If the principal moments of inertia of a section for a given point
are represented by C and D, the moment for a chosen axis through this-


Thk Technic.
point making the angle &lt;f with the minor axis of the ellipse will be
I — C cos2 &lt;p + D sin2 &lt;p .
When the center of gravity corresponds with the center of the
momental ellipse this becomes the central ellipse of the section.
If we lay off upon the minor axis of the central ellipse from the
center of gravity the semi-focal distance C = y a'1 — b' ( Fig. 1) the ex-
tremities F, and F.2 are called the fixed points of the section. The
momental ellipses for these points are circles x&gt;f diameter a. At a point
midway between the fixed points the moment /for a chosen axis A A
becomes I — A i a* -f- el e.2 ) in which A is the area of the section, a
the semi-major axis and c, and e-&gt; the perpendicular distances of the
fixed points Fx and Ft from the chosen axis.
2. UNSYMJ1JETKICAT, LOADING.
If the applied force does not act in a plane of symmetry of the
beam, or if the cross section of the beam is unsymmetrical, then under
the supposition of vertical forces the neutral axis no longer lies co-in-
cident with, but depends upon the line of the force together with the
co-ordinate axes of the central ellipse.
For example, in Fig. 2 if Ix and / are principal moments of inertia
of the section for the axes AW and FY, a = the angle which the
direction of the force makes with A'A', i — the angle which the neutral
axis makes with J'J'. ■


Then the angle /3 is given by the equation:
tan a tan /3 —
v
The neutral axis may be found without the use of the central ellipse
in the following manner graphically: Upon the principal axis OX
( Fig. 3 ) lay off from the center of gravity U the distance Iy = O R and
from K the distance Ix = RQ, and making OQ the diameter of^the-


•circle erect from the point A, where this intersects the line of force HA
a perpendicular to 0 X intersecting the circumference again in C. Unite
R with C and the point B where R C cuts the circumference locates the
neutral axis 0 B . Or,
By Fig. 4. Lay off upon the axis OX from the center of gravity
the distance OR = Ty and upon O Y lay off ON — Ix and erect upon
the principal axes perpendiculars at R and N. The perpendicular in R
cuts the line of force in 8. Making NT — R 8 then TO is the neutral
axis.
For the bending moment M, the maximum stress/in the section is
ax- = —-j— E where J is the moment of inertia for the neutral axis,
E the distance of the outer fibre from the neutral axis, and 6 the angle
between the direction of the force and the neutral axis. In Fig. 3,

the distances of the extreme points from the axes Y Y and XX. The
angle a, which makes the expression a maximum determines the most un-

the axis of abscissas.
3. STABILITY. NORMAL FORCES.
The moment M and the force P acting upon a section may be
M
replaced by a resultant R acting at the point .A, a distance p — -g- from
the center of gravity.
The neutral axis is a parallel to the polar of the point of application
A, drawn upon the central ellipse an equal distance on the opposite side
of the center of gravity from the polar, and may be called the opposite
polar of the point.
[The polar of the point A may be found by drawing through A
two secants cutting the central ellipse in two points which form the
vertices of a quadrilateral. The intersection of the two other sides of
this quadrilateral as well as of the diagonals lie in the straight line
called the polar of the point A ].

To determine the neutral axis for the point A without the use of
the central ellipse:
Upon the principal axes of the section OX and U Y ( Fig. 5 ) lay off
the distances OC and OB equal to the principal radii of gyration of
theisection a and 6 . Then unite C with the point V which is the foot
oftthejperpendicular from A on 0 Fand B with U the foot of a perpen-
dicular^from A on OX. Erect at B and C perpendiculars to the lines

B U and C V and determine the points U x and F, where they intersect
the axes XX and Y Y. The line Ul F, will be the neutral axis. The
converse of this construction supplies the point of application for a giv-
en neutral axis.
If we cause the neutral axis to envelop the section so as to be con-
tinually tangent to it, the points of application A, corresponding to the
various positions of it, determine the contour of a figure within the
section known as the core, and depending upon the form of the section
for its form. As long as the point of application remains within the
limits of the core the neutral axis will remain outside the section and
only stresses of one kind are introduced, but when the point of ap-
plication falls outside the core, the neutral axis intersects the s-ection
and stresses of both signs — i. e. tension and compression—result. The
intensity of stress in a section for a neutral axis parallel to the axis of
gravity is independent of the point of application, also of the amount
of the moment M.

If in Fig. 6,£we determine the point of intersection k of the line O A,
joining the point of application of the force A with the center of
gravity O, with the core and designate the distance of the point k from
the center of gravity O by r, the stress amounts to
f P . M Pg fa ., . . .

By the use of this equation we may determine the greatest stress f

axis or the distance e of the extreme fibre, graphically thus:
Upon a chosen line through the center of gravity O ( Pig. 7 ) lay off

The Technic.
The perpendicular from the center of gravity upon the core border,
which indicates the narrowest breadth of core, designates the most un-
favorable direction of load.
From the above it is apparent that in members supposed to be in
compression the tension on certain sections may be in excess, hence
the importance of the discussion when applied to masonry where ten-
sion on a joint is inadmissible.
Cores for variously formed sections are as follows:
Square—Core is a square with its sides parallel to the diagonals of
the original square and ?'min = half breadth = y —7= = 0.1178 h.
Rectangle—Core is a diamond with sides parallel to the diagonals of
bh
the original rectangle and rmin = half breadth = 6 + ^
Octagon—Core is an octagon with vertices opposite the middles of
the sides of the original octagon and the apothegm rnl|n = 0.2256 R.
R — radius of circumscribing circle.
Circle—Core is a circle of diameter = — •
In case of a foundation made up of a series of piers the core is-
determined according to the method by reference to the central ellipse
for the combined moments of inertia of the several piers and the
tangent neutral axes to the extreme contour of the foundation.
If the piers are arranged in the form of a square, rectangle or octa-
gon the form of core will be the same as for these sections but the value
of r will depend upon the combined moments of inertia of the section.

WRINKLES FOR THE NOVICE IN CEMENT TESTING.
Some of the following notes may be useful, a few may be new,,
none are original.
The common form of mold, in which the two sides are completely
separable and held in place by a screw-clamp, is the easiest form to-
clean, is the cheapest, and answers every purpose.
To clean molds place ten in a row with clamps removed, scrape the
upper faces with a piece of zinc, brush with a stiff horse-brush, and wipe
with oily waste. Turn them over and repeat the process. Then sepa-
rate the two halves of each mold, place the twenty halves in line with
inner ^surfaces up, forming a trough twenty inches long. Wipe this-


99
trough with oily waste, finishing with a piece only slightly oiled, and
the molds are clean.
For getting proportions in mortar it was formerly the practice to
make the parts of sand a multiple of the parts of cement, by measure ob-n
taining for each cement the corresponding weights and using the latter
for all tests with that sample. For instance: A one-to-one mortar (by
measure) might contain for one sample 8 oz. cement to 17 oz. sand, and
for another sample 8 oz. cement to 16 oz. sand. Results from these two
mortars would not indicate the relative values of the two cements, be-
cause cement is bought by weight, not measure. Proportions by meas-
ure are generally used in actual construction, the sand is almost inva-
riably measured, but laboratory tests cannot be compared with results
obtained in actual work. Laboratory tests are doing well if they permit
of comparisons among themselves. Therefore, in testing, use weight
proportions.
When a briquet is made, do not try, to write its history on its surface
with steel stamps. Put a single number across one end near the head,
and write the history in a book opposite the number. The numbers
should, of course, be consecutive, no two briquets having the same
number. The figures on a briquet containing more than two parts of
sand can be made to show plainer if a thin narrow strip of neat cement
mortar is plastered on near the head before stamping.
A small metal lined closet with metal covered shelves affords a bet-
ter method of storing the briquets the required time before immersion
than that of keeping them under damp cloths, though the latter may
be used until the briquets are ready to remove from the molds. A wet
sponge in the closet keeps the air moist.
Have immersion tanks as large as practicable. Record the temper-
ature of the tanks. Renew the water frequently, taking care that the
briquets are not allowed to dry and are not subjected to a change of
temperature. If you do not believe stale water in tanks affects tensile
strength, try it.
A convenient form of immersing tank is as follows: Inside dimen-
sions of tank, 22 inches wide, 15 inches high and 75 inches long. Of
J inch stuff 'i\ inches wide make 20 frames or bottomless boxes 15 inches
high and 21J inches long outside. With strips of zinc 4 inches wide
divide each frame into ten vertical compartments 2 inches by 13£ inches
inside, the extra J inch of zinc being bent at right angles to prevent the
briquets falling out at the back. A 2 inch strip of zinc pivoted at one
end of the face of the frame and catching over a nail at the other
end prevents the briquets falling out at the front and may be lifted to
put the briquets in place. Each frame holds ten sets of ten briquets


The Technic.
each, or a total of 2,000 for the tank. The frames are numbered and the
tank lettered so that G 15-9 in the record book means that the set is in
the ninth space of the fifteenth frame of tank G.
It is seen that the briquets in any given set lie one above the other
when in place, and the frames are lifted vertically to get at the briquets
in any frame. On the whole, this makes a very convenient, compact
and satisfactory method for storing briquets.

kutter's formula and flow of rivers.
It is almost impossible to create a formula with more variables en-
tering into it than enter into a consideration of the probable flow of
rivers. From the fact that there are so many factors entering into the
question, no formula can be expected to give more than approximate
results. But at the same time a formula may have a rating, or may be
expected to yield results within, say, 10 per cent, of the truth for the
range of conditions under which it is supposed to apply. So much the
better if in certain cases it gives a much closer approximation, but if it
sometimes fails without apparent cause, it shakes ones confidence, to
say the least.
About two years ago two gaugings of the Grand River were made.
The sections were laid out with considerable care, soundings taken
every ten feet in each cross-section, and ballasted lath-floats used. The
flaots were timed as they crossed the upper and lower sections, which
were 100 feet apart. From this data, the velocity of float in center of
each section, average cross-section of each 10-foot section, and hence
volume of discharge of each such section was obtained, and by summa-
tion the total discharge was found. At the same time the slope of the
surface was obtained by a careful line of levels.
From the data in hand it was easy to apply Kutter's formula, and
see how closely the computed velocity with assumed coefficient of
roughness agreed with experimental velocity, or what is practically the
same thing, from a knowledge of the river to pick that factor of rough-
ness which seemed most reasonable and compare it with one obtained
by a solution of Kutter's formula.
Taking coefficient of roughness for upper section equal to .033 as
being about right, my coefficient C, came out about 8% too large. With
coefficient of roughness .035 for river in poor condition C came within
2ife of the actual fact, and with a = .036 C came practically correct.
Now in the next section, which was several miles below previous
one, the bottom was freer from hummocks, the slope less, and on the


101
whole I thought the coefficient of roughness, a, ought to be about .025
— .030. Using a = .025, C came within 1\% of the true value. And with
a = .026 C was practically correct. Even with a = .030, C came within
about 10% of experimental value.
So much for the accuracy of Kutter's formula on the Grand River,
which at no point of the cross-section measured over 5 feet deep, and
nowhere was the change of depth in ten feet—distance between consec-
utive soundings—more than 1.25 feet, and as a rule not more than .60 to
.75 foot. The width was 330 feet in one case and 465 feet in the other.
Some estimates by formula were made a short time ago of the dis-
charge of the Kankakee River in Indiana, and a peculiar problem arose
in connection.
An engineer gave these conditions as being " close enough for the
purposes in hand."

Slope = lin 10.000 or .0001.
As the river was reported to be in rather bad shape, took a = .032
and found coefficient, C = 55.05. Discharge = 1,140 cu. ft. per minute.
Now what difference would it make if we considered the above as
two rivers with a thin partition, A B, between them?
Solving for the two discharges we get for the sum 1,745 cu. ft., or
over 50% more.
It makes little difference if the cross-section be modified to a trap-
ezoid which shall bear a closer resemblance to the sloping banks, etc.
And reducing the coefficient of roughness from .032 to .030 on account of
a slight increase of wetted area by the partition added did not affect
matters materially.
The discrepancy would apparently be accounted for by these facts.
The sum of the two partial areas is equal to the original area. The sum
of the two perimenters is greater than original, and sum of two hydranl-

is 50%more than discharge of original section, as discharge of very
shallow half of original section is only 25 cu. ft. per minute.
The real question, then, is, why does Kutter's formula give a longer
discharge to a portion of the river than to the whole?
It is because while treated alone the shallow rectangle gives a flow
of a little over 1 % of deeper rectangle, when combined in original sec-
tions the effect of small rectangle is negative, reducing the m. h. r.
below its value for the larger rectangle and not increasing area sufficient
to counterbalance. Hence Kutter's formula cannot be expected to ap-
ply to any but ordinary cross-sections, and if peculiar ones are met
with it is best to cast aside all shallows and leave only the channel part
of the stream; in other words, to approximate to the class of cross-sec-
tions upon which the formula was founded and to which it applied. A
study of Ganguillet and Kutter's book will of course reveal all this.

THE INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS.—WORLD'S COLUMBIAN
EXPOSITION.
On May 1st, 1893, the meetings of the "World's Congress Auxiliary"
were inaugurated in Chicago, in the Permanent Art Palace on the Lake
Front Park. This auxiliary aims to provide for the proper presentation
of the intellectual and moral progress of the World, in connection with
the Exposition, through a series of World's Congresses with tne assist-
ance of the leaders in all the great departments of modern thought.
The Congress has been divided into XIX different departments, the
meetings of which will occupy the entire six months of the Exposition.
These departments will embrace Woman's Progress, The Public Press,
Medicine and Surgery, Music, Literature, Education, Government, Re-
form, Science and Philosophy, Architecture, etc., etc., and, of direct
interest to the engineer, an "International Engineering Congress."
The subject of an International Congress of Engineers was first pro-
posed by Mr. E. L. Corthell, the engineer of the Tehauntepec Ship Rail-
way, who will be remembered by the Technic readers as presenting our


103
Engineering Society with the nucleus of our present library. A Euro-:
pean tour on the part of Mr. Corthell did so much toward presenting the
subject to distinguished foreign engineers, and so much enthusiasm
greeted the proposal from our various American Societies, that its suc-
cess was early assured, indeed growing so rapidly that it was found nec-
essary to divide the Congress into the following divisions, each under
the direction of the American Society of that particular branch of
engineering:—
Division A — Civil Engineering.
Division B—Mechanical Engineering. .'
Division C — Mining Engineering.
Division D — Metallurgical Engineering.
Division E — Engineering Education.
Division F — Military Engineering.
Division G — Marine and Naval Engineering.
Electrical Engineering will come under the head of Science and
Philosophy.
The time assigned the Engineering Congress is the week beginning
Monday, July 31st, and ending Saturday, August 5th, 1893. A general
opening session will be followed by the divisional sessions, and at these
meetings it is proposed to have papers and discussions from the leading
engineers of the world on all topics of live interest to the engineering
profession.
These papers and discussions will probably be published in a series
of uniform volumes, thus giving us the latest and soundest engineering
literature of the day. Papers written in foreign languages will be trans-
lated by volunteers from the various American Societies. A few of the
more interesting papers already received might be mentioned as fol-
lows:
"Railways of the Par West" by Mr. Bogul. •
"Drainage of Chicago" by Benezette Williams.
"Development of the Water Power of Niagara Falls", John Bogart.
"The Treatment of Metals for Structural Purposes", James Christie.
"Drainage and Sewerage of the City of Mexico", Roberto Gayol,
City Engineer of Mexico.
"Superstructure of Memphis Bridge", Geo. S. Morison.
"Some Public Works of Russia" by T. Shmeleft, Public Counselor
of Russia, etc., etc.
As well as papers on "Engineering Education" by Prof. Ricketts of
Renssalaer Poly't. Inst.; Prof. Geo. F. Swain of Mass. Inst, of Tec'h.;
Prof. Carhart, U. of M.; Prof. Greene, U. of M.; Prof. Muoin, London;
Prof. Armstrong, Edinburg, and many other well known men from seas


of learning at home and abroad, while the following names will indi-
cate the high standard of excellence of the proceedings of the Congress:
L G. Nagnaglie, Bear Admiral, Italian Navy; City Engineer of Messina,
Italy; Capt. Mahan, Lighthouse Board, TJ. S. Navy; H. D. Hoskold,
Inspector General of Mines, Argentine Bepublic; Dr. A. B Leeds, of
Stevens Institute; Walter E. Lilly, of Trinity College. Dublin; Percy
Waldram, of Eng'r. Soc. of London; Prof. W. H. Burr, Columbus, O.,
University; Dr. B. H. Thurston, Cornell University, etc., etc. besides five
papers from the Soc. of Engr's of Lisbon, Portugal; four papers from
members of the U. S. Coast Survey and many others in German, French,
Austrian, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Bussian, etc., etc.
Engineering headquarters will also be maintained in the city of
Chicago by the Engineering Societies of the U. S. for the reception and
entertainment of foreign and visiting engineers. Headquarters have
been established at 10 VanBuren St. in the city, and also in the mines
and Mining Building at the Fair Grounds. Visiting engineers will be
received at these points, given such information as they may desire,
and made acquainted with each other and with engineers of our own
country.
THE SHONE HYDRO-PNEUMATIC SEWERAGE SYSTEM AT THE WORLD'S FAIR
GROUNDS.
The writer has lately been engaged in superintending the building
on the Fair Grounds, which contains the Sewerage Cleansing tanks for
the treatment of the sewage of the World's Columbian Exposition, and
as this plant is the largest installation of the Shone system yet
employed in this country, a few words in description may be of inter-
est.
As the site of the Fair is very flat, varying from 5 to 11 ft. above
Lake Michigan, sufficient grades could hardly be obtained for any sys-
tem of sewerage collection by gravitation sewers alone. Three separate
systems of sewerage were therefore decided on;—First, the roof-water
system, emptying into Lake Michigan direct—second, surface and road
drainage, emptying into the lagoons—and third, the sewerage system
proper, where the sewage is pumped to purification tanks, located in a
far corner of the grounds; for this removal of the sewage proper of
the entire Park area, it was decided to use the Shone Hydro-Pneumat-
ic system, as particularly applicable to the existing conditions.
The Fair site contains over 600 acres, with more than 400 buildings.
Some 3000 water-closets, with urinals and wash-basins in proportion,
provide for a daily attendance of 150,000, with a possible maximum of
400,000. In the use of the Shone system, the first step is to divide the




total area into as many drainage areas as desirable, depending on con-
tours, population &amp;c. The areas being thus defined, the lowest point in
each is determined, or in level ground the central point, and here, at an
"Ejector Station," all the sewers of the district are centered. At this
station is placed a " pneumatic ejector." into which the sewage gravi-
tates from the sewers and gradually fills the ejector until about full,
when the pressure of the sewage against a bell in the top of the ejector
is sufficient to open the compressed air admission valve. The air-com-
pressing plant in Machinery Hall, placed as an exhibit by the Norwalk
Iron Works Co. of South Norwalk, Conn., consists of three compound
air compressors and one double compound air compressor, delivering
air to the ejectors at a pressure of 50 lbs. pr. sq. inch. This compressed
air drives the whole contents of the ejector before it through the bell-
mouthed opening at the bottom of the ejector, into the sewage dis-
charge pipe, and thence to the cleansing tanks. The sewage can only
escape from the ejector by the outlet pipe, as the inlet pipe is closed
automatically the instant the air pressure is admitted.
In the Exposition Grounds are twenty-six ejector stations, most of
them under the floors of the large buildings, with some in roadways and
some in grass plats. Two ejectors are placed at each station, varying
in capacity from 60 to 600 gals, each per minute, and having a total dis-
charging capacity of 17,000,000 gals, in 24 hours.
At the Cleansing Works are four receiving tanks, made of steel
plates riveted, each tank being 32 feet in diam. and 55 feet high, the
bottoms being hopper shaped. A fifth tank, or stand pipe, stands in
the center of the works, into which the sewage is forced by the com-
pressed air, thus giving a maximum lift of 67 feet from lowest ejector to
top of the stand pipe, the sewage enters 4 horizontal pipes, leading to
large tubes fixed vertically in the center of each settling tank—(see fig-
ure). In this horizontal pipe are placed the "mixers" for supplying
the precipitating agent into the sewage. It then flows down this cen-
tral tube to the bottom of the tank, where it is distributed by means of
radial arms. The heavier matter or sludge gradually settles, leaving
the purified water to rise to the top of the tanks, where it flows into
troughs and thence into the lake. The sludge settles to the bottom of
each tank, where pipes convey it to compressors, making it into hard
cakes, which can be burned or sold as a fertilizer.
This plant is quite unique in that the sewage is forced to such a
height. Other plants similar to this have the tanks sunk in the ground,
but in this case the sanitary engineer of the Pair, Mr. W. S. MacHarg,
decided that the cost of raising the sewage would be less than lowering


The Technic.
the tanks in such bad ground as is here found. If the plant were to
be permanent, this would not be the case.

watch out!
"Watch out! " is a western expression which appealed strongly to
me as an alleged student. Asa" Professor" its appeal is stronger than
before, and I wish that I could impress upon the undergraduate the
necessity of " watching out" if he desires to get to the front with celer-
ity and dispatch after he has been granted a sheep-skin by a benevo-
lent faculty.
"One must learn to obey before he can know how to command"
means that when you are given a lesson you should learn it. "Obey
orders if you break owners " is the limit towards which yod should aim.
But " Watch out!" and when you see that "obey" means " break" let
the owner know, show him a method by which the break may be
avoided, and then obey orders regardless of expense. You have done
your duty. "Jones, he pays the freight."
"Watch out" for the little things which you are not quite sure of.
If your common sense tells you that a statement is wrong, don't believe
it simply because your professor says it is so, or because you have a
book at home that tells you all about it. Your professor is nothing but
a man; man is imperfect and given to erring, and much more given to
collating his good, bad, and indifferent knowledge, and inflicting it on a
patient and long suffering student world for the small consideration of
25 cents a volume from the publishers. Do not be satisfied till you have
found out which is wrong. At first you will be wrong 99 per cent, of the
time, but a trained brain will soon change this percentage perceptably,
and the man who knows why he knows is as near a sure success as mor-
tals get. There are other books on the same subject; Look them up. See
what they say and why they say it. Don't be satisfied till you are sure.
Learn to use the dictionaries and encyclopaedias. Don't be satisfied
with learning by rote what your textbook says on a subject. A phono-
graph can give you points in that line. For instance,—" Watch out! "—
most of you know that adding to, subtracting from, multiplying or
dividing both sides of an equation by the same quantity does not change
the equality. All right:
Let x — a.
Then .r = a3 — ax +
Subtracting a1 from each side
x* —a2 - —ax + x3.


107
Dividing both sides by {x — o)
x + a = X.
But x = a,
.•. 2x — x
and 2 = 1.
Something wrong is there? Well, how many of you were " watch-
ing out" closely enough in the days gone by to point out the fallacy in
the above? All of which reminds me of a story, and as all good stories
have a habitat and the TJ. of M. is the grandest Eoman of them all, we
will begin in the good old-fashioned way: "Once upon a time there
was a Michigan professor whose classes bothered him with their wonder-
ful lack of knowledge of the details of their work. Glittering general-
ities were their strong points, and the professor at last, as professors
very seldom do, lost his patience, say nothing of his temper, and con-
cocting a mixture which would have done credit to Bob Ingersol's
patron saint or sinner, as you choose, called his class about him, advised
them to " Watch out," and with a flourish of Greek and Latin superla-
tives explained his witches mixture, ending his lecture with the expla-
nation that " while the odor was far from attar of roses the flavor might
be otherwise," and plunging his finger in the mixture he placed it in his
mouth while a beatific smile fell athwart his benign countenance. He
then invited the class to taste the nectar which the gods had provided.
The class lined up, as all Michigan men do at the slightest provocation,
and tasted the nectar. It took kitchen mineral soap to remove the
taste, while the professor blandly remarked:
"Gentlemen, if you had'Watched out' you would have noticed
that it was my index finger which I placed in the pot, my middle finger
in my mouth."
Watch out!
Know why you know.
Obey.
And surely thou shalt command.
Percy F. Richardson, C. E.
U. of M., '88.
PULLEY TESTING.
The various forms of pulleys which are in use at present, vary con-
siderably inefficiency, consequently in plants where hoisting pulleys
are used, a great saving of power can be obtained by the judicious-
selection of the pulleys.
The following tests were made by the class in experimental engi-


The Technic.
neering, to determine the efficiencies of some of the pulleys used in
the Mechanical laboratory.
In order to determine the efficiencies, the tests were made in the
following manner:
Let the end of the rope to which the load is suspended be called
the "load end" and the end to which the force, to lift or to lower, is
applied be called the "force end." Let the motion of the load
upward be called "forward motion " and the motion of the load down-
ward be called "backward motion." A known load was put on the
"load end" and a weight put on the force end, just sufficient to pro-
duce " forward motion." Knowing the number of "falls" of rope, the'
theoretical force necessary to produce "forward motion" was com-
puted.
The ratio of this calculated force to the actual force required to-
produce "forward motion" will give the efficiency.
The efficiency for "backward motion" is computed in a similar
manner.
An ordinary, single drop, three "falls", wooden pulley was tested,,
giving the following results:

tion"

HOESE-POWEB CONSUMED BY A CIRCULAR SAW.
The following are the results of a test made on a 12 inch rip-saw
used in the engineering laboratory of the University of Michigan.
'MfcThe horse-power required to drive the saw was measured by a Web-
ber dynamometer, which had been previously calibrated to determine
its horse-power factor.
CZlWhen the saw ran empty, the weight on the dynamometer was 4650
pounds. The average revolutions were 2225 per minute. Horse-power
=.676. The net weight then is the weight on the dynamometer scale,
minus 4650, and from the net weight the net horse-power is calculated,
which equals the horse-power consumed in sawing.
The material cut was dry white pine from one to two inches thick
and from four to sixteen feet long. For convenience the data are given
as speed of cutting including the length and time of being cut.

TESTS OF A HYDRAULIC MOTOR.
In February, 1893, the following test of a Hydraulic Ram was made
by the Senior Class in Mechanical Engineering of the University of
Michigan. The ram was new, and its condition that of actual practice.
The drive port measured 1, inches diameter at the entrance, diminish-
ing gradually to 1J inches in the smallest part. To this port was


Ill
attached by a union a brass nipple 1^ inches inside diameter and 2J
inches long. The drive pipe, 1} inches diameter and 18 feet long, was
connected to this nipple. The two delivery ports measured one inch in
diameter. They were connected to brass nipples | inches inside diam-
eter. The diameter of these nipples was decreased fa inches each by a
burr. But one delivery port was used during the test. It was connected
to 10 feet of f-inch horizontal iron pipe and 40 feet of vertical hose,
J inch inside measurement. The volume of the air chamber was .192 cu.
ft. The area of drive port into this chamber was 2/^ sq. in. It was. ap-
proximately square in. shape. The area of the delivery ports was 1 sq.
inch each. They were also approximately square. The diameter of the
waste valve passage, which was a continuation of the drive passage, was
1£ inches. The waste port was of the same dimensions. The waste
valve weighed .71 lbs. and had a maximum lift of 1^ inches. It was en-
larged below its face to 2} inches diameter, and slightly hollowed on the
bottom against which the water impinged. The edge of this enlarged
disc contained 5 small ports somewhat roughly cut having a combined
area of .93 sq. in. When water was wasting it nassed through these 5
ports, but when the valve closed the ports were closed. The area ex-
posed to water pressure when the valve was open was 3.98 sq. ins. The
supply water was measured by a carefully calibrated water meter. The
waste water was measured by a triangular-shaped weir. The angle was
90. The water delivered by the ram was weighed on a carefully tested
Fairbank's scale graduated to I lbs. The weir head was measured by a
hook gauge graduated to TTjVtF ft- The head of supply water was 4.849
ft, and the head against which water was delivered was 38,729 ft. In
the following table will be found the results of five tests taken with the
same head but varying lift of valve:

EDITORIALS.
As has always been the case, The Technic must again offer an
apology for not appearing till after commencement. The fact that it
has never yet got out before college closes seems to show that the pres-
ent method of having the editorial board elected with the second
semester officers might be greatly improved upon by having the editors
of The Technic elected at the spring election, thus giving them a year
instead of the last few months of their college course in which to collect
material for the publication.
* * *
While this plan seems desirable on behalf of the editors it is not
less desirable for the good of the publication itself, Better papers
could be prepared as they need not then be prepared so hurriedly and
the book could be issued and circulated before commencement which
would be a reform very satisfactory to all concerned.
* * *
We hope the engineering society will consider this matter next year,
and that next year's board of editors will make a special effort to im-
prove upon the records of this and all previous boards.
* * *
We take this opportunity to thank those members of the faculty,
alumni, and undergraduates who have so kindly contributed the
material of these pages and extend our gratitude to many others for
advice and timely suggestions.

EDWARD DEMILL CAMPBELL.
Professor Campbell, now in the thirty-first year of his age, and in
his eighth year from college, has well earned his standing as a metal-
lurgical chemist. Making his way without haste, he has neither paused
nor turned in his course. In college he bent his studies to chemical
lines; after college he at once took to metallurgy as a field for chem-
ical action, and in this field his labors have been continuous. He has
met with obstruction, to be sure, but he has not been in any sense inter-
rupted in his career. As a contributor, his reports are of growing inter-
est, and as an authority he is of steadily increasing strength. Availing
himself of latest publications, he brings good critical judgment to bear
upon present questions of applied science. He conducts research that
cannot fail of substantial value. As a teacher, Mr. Campbell is so well
known to college readers that his regular college work does not require
delineation in this sketch, which will therefore give more room for
record.
Professor Campbell is a man of Michigan parentage in more than
one sense of this remark. His father, Judge James V. Campbell, has
been one of the largest and best of the makers of the institutions of
this State, a jurist of the Supreme Court for thirty-six years, one of the
founders of a department in the University, in which he served twenty-
five years, the historian of the political life of the commonwealth, and
a counsellor of clear head and kindly heart in all the interests of pub-
lic welfare. Though born in the State of New York, from infancy he


The Technic.
lived his life in Detroit; here he married and here he had a family of
five sons and a daughter, the youngest being Edward Demill, born
September 9, 1863. Four of Judge Campbell's sons graduated in this
University, and they were in the classes of '76, '80, '82, and '86. The
younger two sons have taken to college work, Douglas H. Campbell
being at present the professor of botany in Leland Stanford University.
The youngest son, in his turn, passed through the public school sys-
tem, graduated in Detroit High School in 1881, and entered the Univer-
sity, for bachelor of science, in the fall of that year.
His early tastes were for natural history. Before entering the high
school he had commenced a quite careful study of the birds of the
Northern United States, making collections and in this way cultivating
a free out-of-door life. As late as the last two years of his college
course he carried some work in comparative osteology. He prepared a
fine collection of the sterna, which, with smaller collections of skele-
tons and of entire birds, he finally presented to the University in 1891.
In the beginning of his sophomore year, October, 1882, Mr. Camp-
bell took up chemical work, which he prosecuted from that time with
increasing interest until his graduation. In December, 1883, he became
the qualitative assista7\t, and through lSS-^ he served as the quantita-
tive assistant, having in all a service of nearly three years as assistant
laboratory instructor. His leading studies were taken with Professor
B. W. Cheever. At the time of his graduation, in 1886, he had over-
credits amounting to about a year's work, and had he shaped his stud-
ies for the master's degree he might have been examined for it in the
year in which he took the degree of bachelor of science in chemistry.
Two others took the last named degree in '86, Frederick G. Novy, now
in the faculty here, and Louis M. Dennis, who graduated as bachelor of
philosophy the previous year, and who is at present in the chemical
faculty of Cornell University.
Within a month of his graduation, Mr. Campbell engaged in chem-
ical work for the Ohio Iron Co,, at Zanesville, Ohio. Two years after
he took the place of chemist with the Sharon Iron Co., in Sharon, Pa.,
and in February, 1888, he was given the place of chemist for the Dayton
Coal and Iron Co., at Dayton, Tenn. In the last named works he
became assistant superintendent, continuing duty as the chemist.
While at Dayton, in October, 1888, Mr. Campbell was married to-
Miss Jennie M., the daughter of Mr. C. Ives, of Cincinnati. Since then
he has gone forward with two-fold promise of success. It may be per-
mitted to say of Mrs. Campbell, that her presence is a source of pleas-
ure to all who are privileged to know her, and that in every event of
her husband's life her grace and fortitude have been manifest. And
whatever is written of Mr. and Mrs. Campbell would be quite incom-


13
plete without mention of their four beautiful children, three daughters
and a son, the oldest born December 4, 1889, and the youngest January
29, 1894.
In Dayton Mr. Campbell had such a share in the management of
the works as afforded him a most welcome opportunity for chemical
inquiry into means of improvement in iron production. The opportun-
ity was so attractive to him that for a time he decided not to leave even
upon the invitation of the University. Following the death of Profes-
sor Cheever, in 1888, Mr. Campbell was asked more than once if he
would consider an invitation to take charge of the quantitative and
metallurgical work in the University, but at that time he felt that both
his own interest and his reciprocation of his emyloyer's trust should
prevent his leaving the works. In July of 1889, however, Judge Camp-
bell reopened the correspondence between the University and his son,
and before the close of the year the appointment was arranged, though
not officially made until the 18th of March, 1890, and not to take effect
until the following October. So then, in the beginning of the college
year 1890-91, Professor Campbell took charge of an important branch
of that chemical work to which he had addressed himself as a student
eight years before. i
The published contributions of Prof. Campbell, beginning about a
year before his college graduation, have been continued as follows: I.

Steel," Trans. Amer. Inst. Min. Eng., September. 11.1887: "Estimation of

Jour. Anal. Chem., 7, 301. VII. 1894: "Determination of Nickel-Steel,"
Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc. 16, 96.
We have in Mr. Campbell a good instance of well rounded gymnas-
tic culture together with unflagging industry in scholarship. While in
high school and in college he was habituated to quite long excursions
in the country on foot. In college he joined with Prof. Keighard and
with other students, in the organization of in-door gymnastic work,
renting for this purpose a room over a store on Main Street, then a
room on Ann Street, and afterward the rink on West Huron Street. He
has continued gymnastic practice, none the less since the loss of his
sight, taking great comfort in systematic athletic exercise, and in the


,The Technic.
use of an out-door walking track fitted up on his own place. He seldom
permits the pressure of his onerous duties to interrupt the regularity of
this exercise, in which he takes much pleasure.
Prof. Campbell is now completing his fourth year in charge of
metallurgical chemistry and qualitative analysis. For two of these
years he has carried the work without the use of sight, the loss of which
befel him on April 12, 1892, while upon duty, conducting chemical
investigation with his students. An account of the occurrance can be
found in Journal Analytical Chemistry, volume 6, page 240. Certainly
the laboratory work of his several courses has been carried for the last
two years with no less exactitude in respect to detail than before, and
with no less vigor in respect to thoroughness. And it is within the last
two years that the more distinct advances have been made in the depart-
ment in Professor Campbell's charge. Among these advances are the
fuller study of special literature in the library, and well defined investi-
gation in the laboratory, carried out by growing number of students
conducted by Professor Campbell in person, aided as he is by faithful
assistants. He is in direct relation with all the work of his advanced
students, both in experimentation and in reading. His organization of
bibliography for college credits has been stimulating and helpful.
An instance of good executive service is that of the qualitative
exhibit of the composition of metallic products, shown by the University
at the World's Fair. It consists of articles prepared, mounted, inscribed,
and arranged by students under Mr. Campbell's specific directions in
detail from beginning to end. The method is quite unique for metals,
though not unknown for other articles, and it is a very instructive piece
of educational equipment.
The line of research chosen by Professor Campbell and being con-
ducted by him is that of inquiry into the actual chemical state of the
elements as they exist in the metals of manufacture. There have not
been very many workers along this line, though some able chemists are
now engaged upon it. It may be said of the elements and distinct
chemical compounds in a bar of steel, as it has been said of the com-
ponents of tissue in a living body, the instant they are reached by the
ugents of the analyst, they undergo transmultation into other bodies.
It remains for the most part to be ascertained just what distinct com-
pounds exist in a given article of iron before it suffers chemical change.
An actual "proximate analysis" is wanted for iron and steel. Professor
Campbell is prosecuting the inquiry at present in two ways: (1) By
greater completeness in chemical determinations of both the solid and
the gaseous products a reaction, so to reach if possible the real chemical
constitution of the bodies reacted upon. (2) By microscopical studies
of polished sections, before and after the action of selected chemical


15
agents. These two methods, the chemical and the microscopical, co-
operate to the same end. In such an inquiry progress can but creep
with exceeding patience of many workers. But whatever real deter-
minations can be obtained will not fail to have some meaning at once,
both in primary questions of all chemical science and in special ques-
tions of industrial valuation. A. B. Prescott.

The Technic.
FRANK CASPAR WAGNER.
Frank Caspar Wagner, the subject of this sketch, was born in the
city of Ann Arbor, October 5, 1864, of German-American parentage on
both sides. His father, William Wagner, left his home at Moeringen,
near Stuttaart in Wiirtemberg, in 1838, in his twentieth year, and came
to this country carrying all his possessions in a small bundle. Set-
Settling in Washtenaw county he soon became one of our most promi-
nent business men and has established an example of sobriety and
christian character which is one of the most cherished inheritances of
his children. In 18— he married Miss Priscilla Antoinette Moeller who
was born at Nazareth, Pennsylvania,—her father being a native of Mary-
land and her mother a native born American of German descent. From
his maternal grandmother, a person of remarkably strong character and
great intellectual ability, Frank has inherited many of his prominent
traits. Family tradition reports her as having been extraordinarily
gifted in mathematics, and the family history is a striking example of
the truth of Oliver Wendell Holmes' adage that to educate a man you
must begin with his grandmother. This hereditary education was in
Frank's case most successfully continued by his mother who gave her
children all the advantages of a christian home and a most intelligent
supervision of their youthful development.
It is our agreeable task to note briefly the principle events in the life
of this young German-American. Born in the University town and
having passed the greater part of his life in its serene atmosphere, Frank
could not fail to imbibe an enthusiasm for scientific pursuits. His edu-
cation began, while yet in his fifth year, in our public schools. As a
boy of strong will he occasionally displayed the characteristic traits of
our youth and subjected himself to the mild remonstrance of his teach-
ers, The penalty inflicted on one occasion, confinement in a closet con-
taining the dinner pails of his schoolmates, in no way interfered with
his growth, which was a fortunate circumstance as he was small for his
age. He entered the Ann Arbor High School at the age of eleven and
completed both the classical and Latin-scientific courses in four years,
and with such success as to gain for him the honor of graduating one
of the first two in his class, and of taking part in both the Junior Exhi-
bition and Commencement exercises.
A visit to the Centennial Exposition where Machinery Hall was the
chief attraction, coming as it did early in the High School course, had


17
much influence in giving trend to a mind naturally inclined towards
mechanics. From that time all his work was planned with a view to
the engineering profession. It was also during the High School period
that he became interested in the work of the church of which he has
been a consistent member since 1879. The Christian Endeavor Society,
the Sunday School and the Students' Christian Association have each
known his quiet and unobtrusive influence. In the latter organization
he filled successively the office of secretary, managing editor of the
Bulletin, vice-president and president. In 1888 he assisted in founding
a Y. M. C. A. among the American residents of the City of Mexico.
Entering the University of Michigan in the A. B. course in 1880 with
sufficient credits to admit of graduation in three years, Frank, at the
end of two years, changed to the University system and received the
degree of A. M. in 1884 at the age of nineteen. For the Master's degree
he chose for his major subject electricity and for his minors chemistry
and analytical mechanics, his thesis being devoted to "The Electro-
Magnetic Theory of Light."
During the next year we rind- our friend in the University calendar
as "Assistant in Physics" to Professor Charles K. Wead, for whom he
has always entertained a high regard and to whose instruction in applied
mathematics he feels he owes much of his success. This year also
served to complete the course in mechanical engineering. His theses
presented for the degree of B. S. (M. E.), and entitled "Some Electric
Light Tests," possessed more than ordinary interest and merit; it was
devoted to carefully conducted tests of the VanDepoels arc and of the
Edison incandescent lighting plants at that time (1885) in operation in
this city. These were among the first practical tests of electrical
machinery made in this country in which the fuel cost of an electrical
horse-power and the efficiencies of the engines and dynamos were
determined. The results of these tests were favorably received by the
American Association for Advancement of Science the following August
and subsequently appeared in full in the American Engineer, a very fit-
ting conclusion to his college course.
Six weeks of the summer of 1881 were spent at the Industrial Works.
Bay City, acquiring knowledge of the practical part of his profession.
_As usual with those starting at the bottom of the ladder, the first work
was sweeping floors in which he achieved his customary success and
passed off the course at the end of four weeks. Advancement to a
lathe was almost immediately followed by a severe attack of fever and
the balance of his vacation was passed in bed. Habits of industry and
plenty of manual labor formed natural supplements to a strong mind,
so that at final graduation the preparation for active professional work
-was unusually complete.

The year following graduation was spent in waiting for a job, and
incidentally in further reading and study and helping to erect the
machinery in the new Engineering Laboratory which had just been
completed. Tired of waiting Mr. Wagner started with his grip in July,.
1886, to look for a job, and his first application in person, to the Thom-
son-Houston Electric Company, at Lynn, Massachusetts, was successful.
Truthful to the old adage", "it never rains but it pours," two other offers
were received the same week, one as assistant examiner in the U. S.
Patent Office, the other from the President of Northwestern University
asking if Mr. Wagner were available to fill temporarily the vacancy in
the Chair of Physics caused by Professor Carhart's call to the University
of Michigan. Both of these offers were declined because of a firm
resolve to be an engineer.
Once started on his practical career success followed success and
Mr. Wagner soon found himself entrusted by his company with the
responsible work of erecting and installing electric plants. An arc
lighting plant at Greenport, Long Island, was followed by one at
Patchogne, the latter driven by water-power, and this by an alternating
current plant at Hempstead. At this early period in alternating current-
machinery numerous difficulties were met and successfully overcome,
and notwithstanding the fact that the machine was among the first half
dozen sent out from the factory and that Mr. Wagner had never before
handled one, the plant was successfully started with only one day's
delay.
Directly from this last success orders were received to go to Mexico
as engineer in charge of all the Thomson-Houston Company's interests
in that territory.
Lighting plants were successfully installed in the Hotel Iturbide in
the City of Mexico, a private palace of the emperors before the time of
Maximilian, and at Pueblo. The latter was a plant of one hundred arc
lights operated by a water-power seven miles out of the city. Several
minor plants were installed in cotton factories and numerous estimates
for new plants prepared, some of which have been erected since. A
report was also submitted on the feasibility of an electric railway in the
City of Mexico.
While engaged on this work Mr. Wagner began experiments on an
electric meter which were so promising as to lead him to resign his
position so that he might come home the better to pursue his investiga-
tions. Returning via Havana and New York, a year was spent in this
work which owing to patent complications then had to he abandoned.
Incidentally, however, the work lead to the invention of a successful
volt meter.
In 1887 Mr. Wagner presented a paper before the American Associ-


19-
ation for Advancement of Science, of which he is a member, on " An
Analysis of Dynamo Design." Much of the work for this paper had
been done the previous year in Ann Arbor while waiting for work, and
it was completed as soon as opportunity for obtaining certain data was
afforded by his connection with the Thomson-Houston Company. This
paper, published later in the Electrical World, is remarkable as being the
first work of its kind done in this country; and while published shortly
after the celebrated papers by Drs. J. and E. Hopkinson, of England,
upon the same subject was worked out independently.
In 1890-92 Mr. Wagner was appointed Acting Assistant Professor of
Mechanical Engineering in the University of Michigan. This was
changed the following year to Assistant Professor which position he
now holds. It adds much to our pleasure and gratification that the
offer of a professorship in a neighboring state university a year since
was not considered a sufficient inducement to leave his alma mater and
home where his work is so fully appreciated.
Professor Wagner's reputation has led to frequent employment
about the state as an expert. Time has not afforded opportunity to
engage in extensive literary work for which he is so well equipped.
The Technic has been favored by articles on "Electric Eailways" and
on " Armature Eeactions." His classes are familiar with his more recent
lectures on Electrical Design.
Not the least important of his successful undertakings was his mar-
riage in June, 1892, to Miss Mabel Peck, who together with two little-
ones make up his happy home. The youngest, Caspar, has the honor
of adoption by the '94 Mechanical Engineers—so says the silver cup.

ALEXANDER ZIWET,
Alexander Ziwet was born in Breslau, Germany, February 8, 1853.
His father was of Polish descent, possessing considerable estates in
both Russian Poland and Prussia. His mother was a German.
His early instruction, taken under private tutors at home, was such
that at the age of twelve he was able to enter the fourth class in the
gymnasium at Gross-Glogau. He graduated August 25, 1870.
The years 1870 to 1874 were spent in Russia. The death, first of his
father and then of his mother, together with the bad management of
his father's property, had left Mr. Ziwet largely dependent upon his
own resources. From 1870 to 1873 he resided principally in Warsaw,
giving private lessons in Latin, Greek, German and French, studying
Polish and Russian, and attending some lectures in the University. In
1873 he entered as a regular student in the philological-historical de-
partment of the University of Moscow.
In the fall of 1874 a small bequest from his grandmother enabled
him to carry out the long cherished purpose of devoting himself to
mathematics and science. He returned to Germany, and spent six
months in an architect's office m Berlin as a preparation for the Berlin
Bau-Akademie. In 1875 Mr. Ziwet entered the Polytechnic School at
Karlsruhe, Baden, where he took the regular five years' course in civil
engineering. During one year of this time he served in the German
army, being connected with the Baden field artillery.
Among his professors at Karlsruhe Dr. Wm. Schell of the depart-
ment of theoretical mechanics and modern geometry attracted and
influenced him most. It was largely due to his persuasion that Mr.
Ziwet undertook the translation of J. Somov's Theoretische Mechanik,
Vol. I. and II., from Russian into German. This was published by
Teubner, Leipzig, in 1878, 1879.
Other professors that may be named were J. Liiroth, pure mathemat-
ics; Franz Grashof, elasticity, strength of materials and theory of ma-
chines; Wm. Jordan, surveying and geodesy; L. Sohncke, experimental
and mathematical physics.
Soon after graduation, like many another German, Mr. Ziwet deter-
mined to try his fortunes in America. He stopped for a few days in
New York City, but soon came on to Detroit, where he had friends whose
acquaintance he had formed in Karlsruhe. Through their instrumen-


21
tality he secured a position in the office of the U. S. Lake Survey under
Gen. Corastock. In 1882 when the work of this survey was completed
Mr. Ziwet accepted a similar place in the computer's division of the
U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey at Washington. In this he was engaged
five years. A considerable part of his time was given to the reduction
of the astronomical observations made by the lamented Edward Israel
of the Greely expedition.
In 1887, seeing no very bright prospect of promotion and saddened
by the death of a sister who had been his companion for several years,
Mr. Ziwet returned to Detroit and began giving private lessons in
modern languages.
In 1888 the flattering commendations of his friends in Washington
and Detroit led to his appointment as instructor in mathematics in the
University of Michigan. Since that time he has been in the continuous
service of the University, having been made assistant professor in 1892.
The summer vacation of 1890 was given to a trip to Italy for pleas-
ure and recreation, although Mr. Ziwet availed himself of the oppor-
tunity to visit the leading universities and polytechnic schools, and to
form the acquaintance of many of the principal professors.
Mr. Ziwet has contributed various articles to the Analyst, Annals of
Mathematics and Science. Since 1892 he has been one of the three
editors of the Bulletin of the New York Mathematical Society.
In 1893 he published Parts I. and II. of An Elementary Treatise on
Theoretical Mechanics, a " work intended * * as an introduction to
the science of theoretical mechanics as such, * * aiming to make it
serve as a preparation for the practical applications of this science, and
to bring out the utility and importance of the purely mathematical
training."
Part I. deals with Kinematics, Part II. principally with Statics,
and Part III., expected to be ready in 1894, is to deal with Kinetics.
Mr. Ziwet attended the Congress of Mathematics, held under the
auspices of the World's Fair Auxiliary in Chicago, in August, 1893.
Immediately after the adjournment of the Congress, Professor Klein, of
Gottingen, consented to hold a colloquium at Evanston for a couple of
weeks. This unusual opportunity for hearing the distinguished math-
ematician was taken advantage of by twenty or thirty teachers from
various colleges and universities, among them Mr. Ziwet. These lec-
tures were carefully reported by him each day, the notes being revised
by Dr. Klein himself, and published in an attractive volume by Mac-
millan &amp; Co. early in 1894.
Such is a brief sketch of the prominent events in the life of Alex-
ander Ziwet, but it utterly fails to present the personality of the man.
As a scholar, his knowledge is broad, yet deep. Equally at home

in the French of Racine and Moliere, and the Greek of Euclid and his
contemporaries, in the German of Clebsch, Jacobi and Mobius, and the
Latin of Horace and Juvenal, his modesty knows no affectation. From
the abundance of his resources he is ever ready to contribute toward
the needs of his associates.
As a teacher of mathematics, his knowledge of the subject is
equalled only by the clearness of his presentation. Though his patience
is often sorely tried by the dull pupil, his equanimity is never dis-
turbed.
As a man most lovable, his colleagues prize his acquaintance, his
friends see him all too seldom.
Happy the University that has secured his services, happier still
the institution that can retain theml

PROFESSOR GEORGE W. PATTERSON, JR.
The personal and family history of those who are prominent in an
official or public capacity is always and very properly of great interest.
This is especially true in the case of people of agreeable personality
and popularity.
The subject of this sketch was born at Corning, N. Y., February 1,
1864, of Scotch-Irish ancestry. His grandfather, George W. Patterson,
1st, was born at Londonderry, N. H., where his ancestors from London-
derry, Ireland, settled about 1690. He removed to New York state
while a young man and subsequently served as a member of the legis-
lature from 1840 to 1846, and as Lieutenant Governor from 1846 to 1848.
Professor Patterson's father, the second of the same name, was born
at Leicester, N. Y., 1826, and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1848.
He settled at Corning, N. Y., as a banker, and, in 1861, married Miss
Frances Todd. In 1876, the family removed to Westfield in the same
state, where they have since resided.
Professor Patterson graduated from the Westfield Academy at the
early age of fifteen, and, after waiting a year, entered the Yale Univer-
sity in 1880. He distinguished himself in college as a mathmetician,
taking first mathematical prizes in the freshman and senior year and
second prize in the sophomore year. He graduated with the degree of
Bachelor of Arts in 1884. The next year was spent abroad, and in the
autumn of 1885 he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
from which he graduated two years later with the degree of B. S. in
Electrical Engineering. He evinced such decided mathemathical ability
there that he was at once engaged as Assistant in Mathematics. He left
this position after one year, though the authorities informed the writer
that they should have been glad to retain him. The following summer
he was with the Thomson-Houston Co. at Lynn.
In 1888, to gratify a wish of his father, he entered the Harvard Law
School and completed the first year of the course. He had no intention
of practicing law but engaged in the study for the sake of the advan-
tage which such knowledge would bring to business life.
While in St. Petersburg the following summer he was offered the
position of Instructor in Physics in the University of Michigan. He
accepted and came directly from St. Petersburg to Ann Arbor to enter
upon his duties at the opening of the college year of 1889-90.


The Technic,
The opportunity thus offered to make a permanent place for him-
self in university work was eagerly embraced, and the work was dili-
gently and successfully pursued. After serving two years as Instructor
he was advanced to the position of Assistant Professor of Physics and
this title he still holds.
Professor Patterson is an unusually clear thinker, is quick to detect
flaws in reasoning applied to the demonstration of physical laws, is
inventive in applying new methods to the investigation of physical
problems, and devotes himself with great urbanity and skill to the solu-
tion of the difficulties encountered by students in physics. It gives the
head of the department much pleasure to acknowledge his indebtedness
to him for the efficient aid which he has rendered in developing the
department, including Electrical Engineering, during the past five
years.
During the past year he has been engaged in a work of considerable
magnitude and importance, viz., the translation, with additional notes,
of Palaz's book on Photometry. The book is published by VanNostrand
&amp; Co., and will appear very soon.
In July, 1890, Professor Patterson married Miss Merib S. Rowley,
B. A., class of 1890. Mrs. Patterson combines charming social qualities
with intellectual tastes and gifts in a happy proportion. The result ia
a delightful home where friends are welcome, and where the husband
is aided by the literary gifts and culture of the wife.

THE MECHANICAL IDEA.
I will use the term "The Mechanical Idea" to distinguish modern
science from the ancient; the Aristotelian from the Baconian. The
former was metaphysical, the latter, one of trial. "Try it and see" is
the test now required of theories, whether in physical or social science,
and may and ought to be applied to politics and theology.
Aristotle taught that when the impelling force ceases, the body
ought to come instantly to rest, but every one observed that a body
thrown into the air continued to move after it left the hand, so that his
theory must necessarily be modified. Instead, however, of testing the
correctness of his theory, he proceeded to explain the cause of its fail-
ure by saying that when the body was put in motion the air in the im-
mediate vicinity was also put in motion and after the body left the hand
the air continued to act and so drove the body along.
It is interesting to determine, when possible, the beginnings of
things, or the dividing line separating the old from the new. In this
case we are able to say that Galileo initiated the "mechanical method."
Not that others before his day did not have correct ideas, or correct
methods in many things, but that with him originated the modern
method of investigation.
He boldly questioned the correctness of many things in the Aris-
totelian philosophy, notwithstanding there were behind it the tradi-
tional belief and support of the best scholars for centuries; and he pro-
posed to prove his theory by a practical test. Aristotle taught that a
body twice as heavy as another would fall twice as fast as the latter.
Galileo declared that they would fall in the same time, and invited the
professors of the University, the students and others, to the tower of
Pisa to witness an experiment that was to prove or vitiate his theory.
Many of the followers of Aristotle were so prejudiced against this new
and comparatively young philosopher that they would not even go to
see the test. Many persons prefer to hold to long cherished theories
rather than learn the truth. Those who went saw two balls of unequal
weight fall from the tower in the same time; and as they struck the earth
they sounded the death knell of the Aristotelian philosophy. One would
naturally suppose that such a demonstration would have been
hailed with joy by all thinking men, but such was not the case. Pre-
vious jealousy now grew into hate, and finally into revenge and perse-
3

cution. He died, but his philosophy lives. The inventor, the mechanic,
the dealer, all recognize the commercial value of the "try-it-and-see"
process. The mechanic arts find their highest exaltation in this prin-
ciple—the physical sciences feed upon and grow with it—social science
is seizing upon it. Political science (if there be one) is at present so
much involved in selfishness, that the principle is not recognized except
when a false principle is carried to such an extreme as to border on
failure or destruction. We ought, even in this science, by means of
statistics, observation and deductions, to avoid many pitfalls into which
society now tumbles.
One cannot predict with certainty what will happen if an untried
element is introduced into a machine or structure. For this reason un-
solved problems are continually arising. Past tests and experiences are
formulated, which enable the engineer to proportion the untried ele-
ment, provided it behaves according to the assumed hypothesis; but in
formulating the hypothesis there is a chance—almost a certainty—that
some principle wil be overlooked, and hence the structure may be de-
fective. Fast running engines developed weakness not suspected in
slow ones. Flexible bridges developed elements not suspected in the
designs. Electricity, in the various forms in which it is being used, is a
living example of the "unexpected" which happens. In all cases the
new structure should add to our knowledge; whether it be a failure or
a. success, a lesson should be learned. Great successes are built on the
ruins of the past. With the best knowledge of the past, and the best
formulas of the present, all results of a particular physical problem are
but fair approximations, j^o one is more forcibly impressed with this
than the experimentalist. He knows that the slightest variations in the
elements, or internal conditions, or surrounding circumstances will pro-
duce a variation in the result sought. Our physical constants, as the
acceleration due to gravity, the specific heat of bodies, the weight of a
cubic foot of air, and the like, are only close approximations under a
certain set of fixed conditions, and it is quite certain that any one of
these constants, found by another experimenter, in another place, and
under other (or approximately the same) conditions would be different.
The engineer predicts the deflection of his bridge, but after completion
it must be "tried" to see if his prediction is correct. The performance
of an engine cannot be computed so accurately as to supercede the try-
and-see process of determining accurately what it will actually do.
Life begins with "trials," the mind is developed by "trials," and science
will never displace the trial process. De Volson Wood.

ENGINEERING FACTS VERSUS CREDULITY.
Engineering is generally considered an exact science, and if we
fully understood all the conditions under which the observations and
experiments were made, the results of which we are often obliged to
accept on faith, it would be strictly true. It is an unfortunate fact,
however, that our reference books have many examples of the deter-
mination of so-called physical facts, which, although correct for the
circumstances'under which the observations were made are absolutely
worthless for a basis in designing engineering works, for the reason that
the relative conditions are unknown. It is therefore very evident that
in accepting results from any authority as a basis for engineering de-
sign, we should know whether the conditions under which such results
were obtained, were identical with those where it is proposed to make
use of them, and if not identical, what will be the probable effect due
to change of circumstances.
Two engineers may test the tensile strength of concrete made from
the same barrel of cement, and obtain results differing over fifty per
cent., either of which might be very misleading if the methods of con-
ducting the experiments are unknown, as is often the case.
Tests of cement, made without any regard to the conditions under
which it is to be finally used, may make a very creditable showing as to
strength, and yet prove to be a complete failure in the structure.
Boiler plates may stand a test of over 60,000 lbs per square inch and
yet fail under a boiler pressure of less than 150 lbs.
One of the most fruitful sources of engineering failure has been
due to accepting without regard to modifying conditions, the results of
experiments made to determine the relation between the rate of flow
of a river current and the size of the particles which different velocities
of current will "move. Years ago the French engineer, Dubuat, found
that water flowing at the rate of three inches per second would move
potter's clay; at the rate of 7 J inches would move coarse sand; at the rate
of one foot would move small gravel, and at the rate of two feet per
second would be capable of moving round pebbles an inch in diameter.
It would be difficult to find a reference book on river hydraulics pub-
lished since Dubuat's observations were made that does not quote his
results as authentic. Col. Elliott in his report on the improvement of
Nantucket Harbor assumes that a velocity of 1.25 ft. per second is suf-


The Technic.
ficient to produce a scour on a bottom of sand and gravel, and quotes
the following authorities:—Debouve, 0.5 to 1 ft. per second; Login, 0.67
to 1 ft. per second; and Weisbach 1.25 ft per second.
Trautwine says that, "Scouring action is supposed to be as the
square of the velocity of current," and gives examples nearly the same
as the above. These authorities are all of such high character that the
unsuspecting engineer might accept their results without question, and
yet all are absolutely incorrect, except for the particular streams where
the experiments were made.
A board of distinguished army engineers, basing their opinion on
results similar to the above, recently designed plans for the improve-
ment of an important coast harbor on which several million dollars
were to be expended, and in their report say that since the mean veloc-
ity of current across the bar will be 2.7 ft. per second, and the maxi-
mum velocity 5.4 ft. per second, such velocities through jetties on fine
sand would endanger their stability.
The absurdity of such fear is manifest when we consider that such
velocities will not disturb the bottom, in mid channel, in depth of over
18 ft. unless aided by wave action.
The amount of work that any stream is capable of doing is equal
to its volume of discharge into its fall in a unit of time, and since the
velocity of river currents varies rapidly with the depth, it is evident that
the slope of large deep rivers must be very small, compared with shal-
low streams having the same velocity, and consequently the scouring
action of any river, for any given rate of current, must be an inverse
function of the depth. This being the case, to assume that any given
velocity will produce certain results, is equivalent to trying to solve a
problem having two unknown quantities with a single equation of
condition.
The action of river currents of different velocities and depths on
the channel bed is very cleverly illustrated by the annual changes
which occur in the bed of the Mississippi River, where the crests of the
bars are raised during the high water and rapid currents of floods, and
cut away during the low water stages when the depths are small and
the slopes steep on the shallow channels connecting the deeper pools.
The fact that some engineer has found that a given velocity of cur-
rent on some stream of unknown depth, will move sand or gravel has
no bearing whatever on what may be expected of currents of the same
velocity in streams of greater depths.
In channels 3 to 5 feet deep a mean velocity of 3 to 5 feet per
second may produce rapid scouring, while in depths of 18 feet and up-
wards current velocities of 6 to 8 feet per second often have no effect
whatever on the channel bed.


29
The amount of sediment that a stream, flowing with a given veloc-
ity, can carry in suspension has been a subject of bitter controversy
among hydraulic engineers, and is by no means a matter on which they
are mutually agreed at the present time. Humphrey and Abbot, in
their extensive investigation, from 1850 to 1861, to determine the Physics
and Hydraulics of the Mississippi Kiver, conclude that no definite re-
lation exists between velocity of flow and the amount of sediment held
in suspension. Their failure to establish such a relation was largely
due to the fact that their entire investigation was devoted to trying to
determine the relative amount of sediment per cubic foot of water, at
different velocities of current, without regard to depth of water, while
the fact of the matter is, that the amount of material, and the size and
weight of the particle which a stream can hold up and carry forward is
a direct function of the current velocity, and an inverse function of the
depth.
Motion cannot occur in matter without an expenditure of force.
The transportation of sedimentary matter by rivers can, therefore, only
result from an expenditure of force, which must necessarily increase
with the height through which the material is lifted, or with the in-
crease in depth of stream.
Many reference books on hydraulics give tables for computing, the
mean and bottom velocities of streams when the surface velocities are
known. Under ordinary conditions these tables may give approxi-
mately correct results, yet there are many cases where such methods
are certain to give erroneous results. For instance, at the mouth of the
Mississippi Kiver the depths on the bars at the mouth of the passes is
from 8 to 12 feet, while at a distance of 18 miles up stream the river is
over 100 feet deep, giving an average minus bottom slope up stream of
5 ft. per mile. Salt water being 3 per cent, heavier than river waters
flows down this slope (up stream) during low stages of the river at the
same time that the surface water is flowing seaward, at the rate of one
to one and one-half miles per hour. During seasons of extreme low
water the river water sometimes becomes brackish from this cause for
over 100 miles from its mouth.
Another hydraulic problem over which engineers have always
agreed to disagree, is whether the confining of a sedimentary river with-
in its banks by means of levees has a tendency to raise the river bed.
A recent writer on this subject says, "Theoretically, and even without
any reference to experience, it should be seen that building dikes along
the shores of frequently swollen rivers must result in raising the bed
over which the water flows." Is this true? In fact does not the equal-
ization of the river forces and the resistances overcome make such a re-
sult an impossibility? If by any means the slope of a river could be


The Technic.
increased for any given stage of water there can be no question but
that the flow would be increased and consequently the capacity to pro-
duce scour correspondingly so. All rivers flowing into the sea have the
level of the water surface at their mouths fixed by the sea level, con-
sequently any raising of the river bed in the upper portions of the river
must proportionately increase the slope between that point and the
mouth. But, as we have seen above, increased slope means an increase
of the force acting to erode the bottom, and therefore, to assume that
levees have a tendency to raise the beds of rivers, forces us to the
anomalous conclusion that an increasing scouring force produces a de-
creasing effect.
There is no doubt but that the beds of sediment bearing streams do
rise, whether the banks have levees or not, but there is no evidence
that the building of dikes has in any case ever increased such action.
If we take the Mississippi River, for example, it will be noticed that
the slope at Cairo is about six inches per mile, and gradually diminishes
to one inch at the mouth of the river. The slope in the Passes is about
double that of the main river directly above, showing that any change
of depth and volume of discharge requires a corresponding change of
slope. The average advance of the Mississippi River delta into the
Gulf, previous to the improvement of the South Pass, was about four
miles per century, and as the average slope from Cairo to the Gulf is
about four inches per mile, it is evident that a silting up of the river bed
of over one foot must have occurred during such period in order to
maintain the natural slope. In other words, the increasing length of
the river, due to the advance of the delta into the Gulf, is the only ap-
parent permanent cause for any rising of the river bed.
This is equally true of the Po and the Yellow River, so often men-
tioned as examples of the disastrous effects of the rising of river beds,
—the only difference being that these rivers, having greater slopes than
the Mississippi River, have a greater rise of bed in proportion to delta
advance.
One great source of error in the results of observations and experi-
ments often arises from an undue belief on the part of the engineer, in
the infallibility of his work and conclusions.
It is fair to presume that every engineer in undertaking to deter-
mine the law governing some phenomenon of nature does his best to
arrive at a correct conclusion, but if he fails to take cognizance of all
the varying conditions that may exist, his results will probably be very
misleading when considered under other circumstances than those ex-
isting at the time his observations were made.
Reports and treatises on engineering works contain many examples
of this character which the young engineer will do well to scrutinize

closely before accepting as basis for designs for work where the condi-
tions are not known to be identical with those on which previous con-
clusions and reports have been based.

THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.
The U. S. Geological Survey is doing work which is not suggested
by its title. It is making a topographic map of the United States. If
its title were framed to more exactly express its functions and duty, it
would be called the U. S. Topographical and Geological Survey. It is
now a little more than thirteen years old, having been created by an act
of Congress passed at the very end of the 45th session, March 3, 1879.
Prior to its creation the government had engaged in studying the little
known areas of the Far West, the Rocky Mountains, and the other great
mountain systems farther west with their intervening valleys and des-
erts. Here vast tracts existed which had barely been seen by white men,
and of which no surveys or maps existed. For intelligent legislation as
to the disposition of this public domain it was necessary to secure infor-
mation about its resources both on the ground and in the ground;
resources in water and timber, and resources in coal and minerals.
Prior to 1879 three surveys were in existence, all engaged in this
class of work, and known as the Hayden, Powell and Wheeler surveys.
Under Capt. George M. Wheeler the War Department was making maps
on a scale of eight miles to an inch and without contours. The Hayden
survey, so named from its director, Dr. E. V. Hayden of Philadelphia,
under the Interior Department, was also engaged in making maps and
studying the general geology of the region. Its most important out-
come in map-making was an atlas of Colorado on a scale of four miles
to an inch, and with contour intervals of 200 feet. The Powell survey,
so named from its director, Major J. W. Powell, was similarly engaged
under the Interior Department in making maps and in studying the
geology of Arizona, Utah and adjacent regions.
The act of Congress which created the Geological Survey was
passed for the purpose of reorganizing this work, and placing it on a
more systematic and uniform basis. The act which created it discontin-
ued the three prior organizations. The work of those three surveys was
confined substantially to a period of ten years following the war, that
is, beginning in 1867 or 1868, they continued to work until 1879. Their
work was wholly confined to the great west. When the Geological Sur-
vey was created as their successor, the work was expanded. The field
of its operations was declared by law to be the national domain, and the
question was soon raised as to what constituted the national domain.

On this there was long and earnest debate in Congress, and in 1882 it
was practically determined by the action of the House of Representa-
tives that the national domain, as applied to the Geological Survey at
least, meant the entire domain over which the stars and stripes float,
■east and west, north and south. Thus authority was given for doing
work not merely in the great west but in the east as well. The Geolog-
ical Survey thereupon entered upon the general work of preparing a
topographic map of the whole United States.
In order to exhibit the structure and resources of the country, topo-
graphic maps are necessary. Without such maps, geologic work must
needs be slow, expensive and unsatisfactory. Geologic surveys have
■existed and now exist in many of the states, but there is probably not a
single director of any state survey who has not found his work greatly
impeded and possible results much reduced by the absence of topo-
graphic maps.
Our situation in this respect is peculiar. In all European states the
geological surveys found topographic maps ready to their hands. Such
maps had been made for military purposes, and were promptly made
use of for other purposes when the need became apparent. With us, how-
ever, all geologic surveys, state and national, have met this obstacle of
lack of topographic maps. About ten years have elapsed since Con-
gress formally authorized the making of such maps, and their making
absorbs nearly one-half the energies and annual appropriations of the
Geological Survey. To obtain a clear understanding of the character
•of this great topographic or mother map which the Geological Survey is
making, readers of the Technic should, if interested in this matter,
examine samples of the sheets in the Library of the University. These
atlas sheets are projected without regard to political or physical fea-
tures, and cover an area of either one "square degree," one-quarter of
a "square degree," or one-sixteenth of a "square degree." Those
which cover one degree of latitude by one degree of longitude are on a
scale of 1:250,000, or approximately four miles to one inch. This small
■scale is no longer used. A considerable tract of country in the far west
has been mapped on this scale, and with contour intervals of 200 or 250
feet.
The next larger scale is 1:125,000, or approximately two miles to one
inch. Atlas sheets on this scale cover half a degree of latitude by half
a degree of longitude. The Appalachian mountain system and large
areas in Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado and California
have been mapped on this scale. The contour interval is in general 50
feet on this scale.
The largest scale used is 1:62,500, or approximately one mile to one
inch. These atlas sheets, of the same size as the two preceding, cover


The Technic.
fifteen minutes of latitude by fifteen minutes of longitude, or one six-
teenth of a "square degree." When these maps embrace a flat coun-
try, the countour interval is small, in some cases so small as five feet, in
others ten feet, but in general the contour interval is twenty feet. On
this mile scale Massachusetts, Ehode Island, Connecticut and New Jer-
sey have been completely surveyed, while considerable areas on the
same scale have been surveyed in New York, Wisconsin, Towa, Illinois
and Louisiana.
The maps are drawn, engraved and printed in three colors, black
being used for the cultural features, blue for all water bodies, and brown
for all hill forms. The form of the surface of the country is shown by
contours. The work is designed to be accurate to scale, that is, to be
free from visible errors. If we assume the one-hundredth part of an
inch as the limit of visible error on the published map, then each point
on the largest scale used must be determined within 53 feet of its true
position in nature. In the process of locating points within this limit of
error, necessarily some of them must be determined far closer. The
initial or base lines upon which the work rests must be so accurately
determined that their errors, when multiplied, shall not in the end intro-
duce an error visible on the map.
The rate of progress of this work is determined by the amount of
money which Congress annually appropriates for carrying it on. Dur-
ing the past few years the amount annually expended has been about
$250,000, and the areas surveyed from 40,000 to 50,000 square miles per
year. The total area mapped to date is nearly 600,000 square miles, or
about one-fifth of the United States, and the total cost somewhat more
than $2,000,000. More or less work has been done in nearly every state
in the Union. There are but four or five states or territories, out of the
forty-nine, that have not had some portion of their areas topographic
ally mapped. Michigan is one of the states in which the area surveyed
is quite small, that small area being confined to the iron region of the
northern peninsula.
I have already mentioned that four states, to wit, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Jersey, are already completely
mapped. The reason for this is that the citizens of those states, through
their Legislatures, co-operated with the Geological Survey to hasten the
completion of their maps. Each of those states, through its Legislature,
appropriated one-half the estimated cost of mapping, and authorized
such appropriations to be expended by the U. S. Geological Survey.
Under this system of co-operation it was possible for these states to
promptly secure the advantages of a completed map.

DIRECTION OF A LINE.
The writer has ben much interested in Prof. Davis' article in the '92
Technic on the direction of a line, and has also read, with some avidity,
everything on the subject that has come to hand. The object searched
for has been a method for determining azimuth, with reasonable pre-
cision, by a short, simple operation. This method must be so simple and
practicable that it not only could but would be used several times daily,
if necessary, in the field by a busy surveyor in the ordinary daily field
work, and particularly for the use of U. S. Deputy Mineral Surveyors
in the survey of mining claims for U. S. patent. Taking into consider-
ation the rough, mountainous country, and the peculiar climate of the
average mining district in Colorado, together with the requirements of
the Deputy Surveyor, night work, i. e, observations on the stars is al-
most necessarily excluded from practice. Many mining-claims are sit-
uated in such isolated, barren places, often so far from any human hab-
itation that it becomes necessary to perform all operations in the day
time, returning to the office each night. An instance is recalled of a
survey made, or rather attempted, in March, '85, of only a mile or a
mile and a half from town. Start was made at 7 o'clock a. m., the
claim reached at 2 p. it., the survey prosecuted from 2 until 4 o'clock
p. m., and home reached at 9:30 p. m. The snow was from 4 to 10 ft.
deep in the vicinity of the claim at that time. The survey was not com-
pleted until the following summer. In the high altitudes (above 10,000
ft.) in the Rocky Mountain region, the weather at night is liable to be
so cold and stormy that night work, even in the middle of the summer,
is exceedingly disagreeable, and to be avoided, if possible. The method
of observing Polaris before dark, as practiced by the U. S. Coast and
Geodetic Survey, requires larger and finer instruments than are
commonly at hand, as well as more extended and intricate calculations
than the ordinary surveyor is capable or disposed to bestow. These
methods are sometimes employed to determine the azimuth of a line
convenient to the office and used to test the adjustments of the instru-
ments. The time and expense, as well as the price received for survey-
ing, bear largely on the method to be used. The sun is, therefore,
looked to for the proper solution of the problem.
In the survey of mining claims U. S. Deputy Surveyors are allowed


The Technic.
no closing errors, although comparatively small errors are often passed
over by the U. S. Surveyor General without returning the field notes for
correction. For instance, as most Deputy Surveyors use transits read-
ing only to single minutes, the course of the closing line of a survey,
or the connection line from corner No. 1 of the survey to some corner
of the public survey, need be given only to the nearest minute of arc.
Some small allowance is also often made for difference in the instru-
ments used and for the personal equation between the different ob-
servers. The requirements of the CJ. S. Surveyor General are indicated
by instruction fourteen to Deputies, which reads as follows: "(14). All
mineral surveys must be made with a Transit, by which the meridian
can be determined independently of the magnetic needle, and all
courses must be referred to the true meridian. The variation should be
noted at each corner of the survey."
When the solar apparatus was attached to the ordinary surveyors'
transit, it was hailed with delight; and from its almost universal adop-
tion, soon became, practically, a requirement of the Department. The
instrument makers consequently reaped a rich harvest from orders re-
ceived f.'om the mining surveyors. But the solar attachment is grad-
ually falling into disfavor, and has been entirely discarded by many
Deputies. This disfavor, whether merited or not, will not be discussed.
The usurping method is designated, usually, as the method by direct
solar observations—and sometimes as meridian by altitude and azimuth.
Several formulas for calculating azimuth from direct observations
on the sun have been proposed. The one commonly used in Colorado
by Deputy Surveyors is given below. Let' the following notation be
used:
C = Co-Latitude of point of observation,
P= Suns Co-Declination = 90° + South dec'lination,
or 90° — North declination.
Z = Suns true zenith distance = 90° + refraction — observed altitude,
A = azimuth from the north.

In the field where the tables used are those commonly found in an
Engineer's Field Book, it is usual to take the trigonometric functions
to the nearest minute or half minute only.
It has been the experience (most unfortunately) of the writer to
have a large percentage of his work to do in the winter when the snow
has been from three to six feet deep on the level, and the weather very
unpleasant. The following is a list of observations made by him, from
the notes of the survey of a group of four mining claims, near Pitkin,
Colo., taken Jan. 8th, 1893, at 2:15 o'clock p. m. The snow was from
three to four feet deep. Hubs were driven in the snow and the snow
packed around them as tight as possible. The exact points were indi-
cated by six-penny wire nails driven firmly into the top of the
hubs and projecting above the snow, to avoid the employing of a back
flagman. The transit was set up and snow packed around the legs and


The Technic.
the instrument made as steady as was permitted. The experienced
engineer will appreciate the difficulty of keeping the instrument level,
in a bright, warm sunshine, under such conditions. The instrument
used was a Gurley Light Mountain transit with solar attachment. Two
determinations of azimuth had previously been made by use of the
solar apparatus, which gave the following results: S 42° 47' 30" E and
S 42° 47' E. Five direct observations were taken, as follows:
Angle to the sun R 72° 22' Observed altitude 23° 22'
"tt a 72° 31/ 30" " "23° 18'
"" " 72° 41' 30" " "■ , 23° 14'
"" " 72° 50' ""23° 10'
"" " 72° 58' ""23° 00'
These observations, reduced by the above formula, determine the
azimuth of the line to be S 42° 48' 20" E. S 42° 48' 20" E. S 52° 48'
10" E. S 42° 48' 10" E, and S 42° 33' E. The last result was, of course,
rejected, and the course adopted was S 42° 48' E, that being as near as
was desired.
The objection to this method is the difficulty of exactly quartering
the sun's image with the cross wires at any time of the year, and more
particularly when the sun's declination is near the maximum, north of
the equator. The liability to error in observing the sun's altitude,
when near the maximum, even with the use of the diagonal prism to the
eye piece, has led the writer to prefer using the solar attachment when
the sun's declination was much north, and the direct observations at
other times. Very often both methods are used, giving the greater
weight at one season of the year to one method, and at the other season
to.the other method, when there is a discrepancy.
It has occurred to the writer to adjust stadia wires to exactly con-
tain the sun's image, and also to take readings on the sun's limb and
correct for semi-diameter, but as yet no experiments have been made.
Latitude is usually determined by observation of the sun when on the
meridian, or by calculating from known distances North or South from
known latitudes. O. H. Aikine, '77.

SOME PRACTICAL POINTS IN WATER-SUPPLY ENGIN-
EERING.
When the Board of Editors honored the writer by a request to pre-
pare something for publication in The Technic, it at once occurred to
him that a short paper on the subject above given might prove accept-
able to the younger members of the Society. Should any of the grad-
uate members who have had experience in water-supply work find any-
thing of practical interest or value in the following lines, its mission will
have been more than fulfilled. The limits of the paper will not permit
any very thorough discussion of the subject, yet it is hoped that some
points may be covered that will be of value to those who have studied
the text-books bearing upon water-supply engineering, but who have
had no practical experience.
WATER-SUPPLY.
When employed by a town proposing to construct a system of
water-works, the first duty of the engineer is to make an investigation
for the purpose of determining the best source of supply. An ample
supply of potable water is absolutely necessary, and that it be a gravity
supply is very desirable. The methods of making extended hydro-
graphical investigations have been fully explained in the text-books,
but it remains for the engineer to see that the necessary investigation is
thoroughly made. In the so-called arid and semi-arid regions of the
West, the question of obtaining an ample supply of good water is one
not often easy of solution.
With the majority of the members of the town Council, in almost
every instance the tendency will be to greatly overestimate the quan-
tity of water that may be obtained from a given source in times of mini-
mum flow; and their instructions will often be to proceed with the
designing of the works, after an exceedingly superficial examination as ,
to the supply. Eight then it becomes the duty of the engineer to insist
that a proper investigation as to the probable quantity and quality of
the water be made under his instructions, and, if necessary, under his
own personal supervision.
If the supply is to be from wells, he will have a test well dug at the
site selected for the wells, and will cause the flow to be thoroughly
tested by means of a pump; if from springs, he will have them cleaned
out and opened up at time of minimum flow, and test by wier measure-


The Technic.
ment, if necessary; if from a small stream, he will at the best point
near the proposed location of the headworks, and at the lowest stage of
the water, put in a wier and measure the flow. Pay no attention to
guesses as to quantity, made by the "oldest settler "; nor is it wise to
accept the results of measurements made by any resident surveyor or
engineer, unless he is known to be competent to make such measure-
ments accurately.
While looking into the matter of supply, it is always advisable to
take into account the probable future growth of the town. In agricul-
tural regions, where the growth is slow and steady, it is well to be sure
that there can be obtained at the headworks a supply of one hundred
gallons per capita per day, for a population double that of the town in
question at the time the investigation is being made.
PLANS.
In planning the distributing system, the probable direction, or direc-
tions, of future growth of the town should be taken into consideration;
and in proportioning the sizes of the mains, the designer should provide
for the population doubling in number well within the life of the works.
The principal mains, which will generally be arranged in parallel lines,
should be connected together by the smaller cross mains, in order that
a free circulation of the water may be maintained; and "dead ends"
should be avoided as much as possible. When making the calculations
for determining the diameters of the main pipes, it will be found that
the flow necessary to provide for the domestic consumption is so insig-
nificant as compared with the flow necessary for fire service, that prac-
tically it may often be disregarded. Provision should always be made
for a liberal number of fire streams, of from 200 to 240 gallons per min-
ute each. There is perhaps some variance of opinion as to the proper
number of such fire streams that should be provided for in any given
case, but the following rule is probably a safe one to use: For a town of
5,000 inhabitants, provide for four fire streams; for 10,000 inhabitants,
six streams; for 15,000 inhabitants, eight streams; for 20,000 inhabitants,
ten streams; for 25,000 inhabitants, twelve streams.
There is opportunity for the exercise of considerable ingenuity in
the selection of points in the distribution for the location of gates and
hydrants, that shall give an economical, and at the same time most
effective arrangement. Their cost is usually but a small percentage of
the total cost of the works, and they are such important adjuncts to the
system, that it is false economy not to distribute them with a very gen-
erous hand.
The natural conditions surrounding the site chosen for the location
of the distributing reservoir will usually govern as to the best and most


41
economical plan for the reservoir. Stone that is suitable for masonry,
or clay that will make an excellent puddle, may be found on the site
itself. The site should be chosen at such an elevation as will give, in
the main part of the town, a pressure in the hydrants of from 65 to 100
pounds per square inch. A hydrant pressure of 80 pounds is about
right, and it should not exceed 100 pounds. As to the size of the reser-
voir, the same rule should govern as for the sizes of mains; that is,
assume a population double that of the town at the time, and then plan
a reservoir of a capacity sufficient for the storage of at least two days
domestic consumption. It frequently happens that the funds provided
are insufficient for the proper construction of the entire works; and in
such cases, it is not wise to try to economize by reducing the sizes of the
mains, or by devising too cheap a plan for the reservoir. It is better to
reduce the size of the reservoir, and endeavor to plan one that shall be
a substantial, safe and permanent structure. It will be much easier
afterwards, when the growth of the town demands it, to increase the
capacity of the reservoir than that of the mains.
Should the town not be fortunate enough in its location to render a
gravity supply practicable or possible, then a pumping plant is neces-
sary. An entire paper, or several of them for that matter, could profit-
ably be devoted to this subject alone, but we can only touch upon a few
points in passing. Often the funds are too limited to permit of any
attempt at architectural effect in the design of the pump house, but it
should be ample in size and substantial in construction, with plastered
walls and tightly boarded ceiling. Provide solid masonry foundations
for the pumps, and locate them as close to the boilers as convenient, in
OTder that the steam pipes may be short. Locate the pump house close
to the source of supply and specify a suction pipe of ample size, in order
that the frictional head in the suction pipe may be small when the
pump is working. Provide for a gate in the force main just outside of
the pump house, so that the pumping plant may be cut off from the
rest of the system when necessary. Provide for an air chamber on the
pump, of proper size; for a check valve, to be placed on the force main
next to the pump; for a relief valve, to be connected with the force
main at a convenient point inside the pump house; for a charging pipe
connecting force and suction pipes; and for all other appliances neces-
ary to put the pumping plant in perfect working order. To get the
force main from the pump into the ground, two ells are generally used,
either 45° or 90°; one, put in the main soon after it leaves the pump, to
make the turn from the horizontal to the oblique or vertical; the other,
used in the trench at the proper depth below the surface of the ground,
to make the turn back to the horizontal. Plan a suitable masonry
backing for the ell in the ground, to prevent its joints being started by
4


The Technic.
the action of water ram. It is well to locate the relief valve on the
force main a few feet further away from the pump than this ground
ell. Be careful to plan a smoke stack of proper height and size, and to
make the specifications for the boilers and appurtenances full and
complete. Provide for a proper boiler feed pump, a feed water heater
and an injector. Plan a rather deep pit in front of the boilers, and
enclose it within brick walls. Some firemen like to have the heat, when
the fire doors are open, strike them.in the upper part of the body, some
in the lower part, and the pit can be filled up afterwards to the depth
desired. Plan a fuel car and track, for convenience in handling the
fuel and firing the boilers.
CONSTRUCTION.
All pipes, before leaving the factory, should be subjected to a suc-
cessful test of 300 pounds per square inch hydraulic pressure. In order
to inspect the pipes properly, it is necessary to wait until unloaded from
the cars; then examine each piece separately, to see that it is concentric
and straight, and at the same time pay attention to the following points:
Ascertain by weighing a number of pieces, and by measurements,
whether all pipes meet the necessary requirements as to thickness.' In
weighing pipes, due allowance must of course be made for the weight
of the preservative coating. If the pipe is of wrought iron, carefully
examine all seams, to see that the shop work has been properly done.
See that none of the pieces have been seriously injured by friction with
each other, or by accident, in transit, and that all metal has been tho-
roughly cleansed from rust and dust before receiving the preservative
coating. Care must be taken to keep the coating as nearly intact as
possible, while the pipe is being unloaded and distributed throughout
the town. After being distributed, it should be carefully examined
piece by piece, and wherever the coating has been damaged, should be
cleaned with a stiff brush, and then receive a thick coat of asphaltum
paint. If any pieces are too badly rubbed and scarred for the coating
to be repaired in this way, they should be re-dipped.
Street mains should be located on one side of the street, at a con-
venient distance from the property lines—say twenty feet. It is not
necessary that the mains be laid to an exact grade, but the lines should
be staked out, in order that the trenches may be straight. The trenches
should be dug to such a depth as will give a covering over the mains of
from three to five feet, according to the climate, and to a width at the
bottom of about one foot in excess of the diameter of the pipes. It is
important to avoid summits; but where one is unavoidable, place it at a
hydrant connection; or if this cannot be done, put in an air valve.
Several lengths of pipe should not be joined together on the surface of
the street and then be laid in the trench, but the pieces should be laid


43
joint by joint in the trench, care being taken to keep the line straight and
to make it conform to a reasonably uniform grade. See that bell holes
are properly dug and all joints let into the earth, so as to secure a uni-
form bearing for the pipe along its entire length. In crossing a gully
or small water course it is best, if practicable, to lay the pipe beneath its
bed, and to dig the trench deep enough on each side to avoid making a
sag in the line. If this cannot be done, then it is well to carry the pipe
across in a box, or in embankment, and provide for the drainage under-
neath by a culvert. When a sag in the pipe line is unavoidable, a blow-
off should be put in to flush out the sediment that is sure to collect
there. Great care should be exercised that no dirt, stones, or obstruc-
tions of any kind are left in the pipe when laid. The caulking should
be thoroughly done, and wherever the pipe coating is damaged in pro-
cess of jointing, it should be renewed with asphaltum paint. If practi-
cable, water should be turned into the pipes before the trench is refilled,
in order that a reliable test of the tightness of the joints may be had.
A good many " expert" foremen seem to believe that a leak will always
show itself at the surface after the refilling has been done, but when
the pipe is in gravelly or rocky ground there is no certainty of its doing
so. When admitting water into the pipes keep hydrants open, to allow
free escape for the air. The refilling should be done carefully and
equally on both sides until the pipe is covered, and the material should
be settled with water at the time of refilling, in order that there may be
as little after settlement as possible.
The special fittings,—tees, ells, crosses, etc., should conform in safe
tensile strength with the plain pipes they are intended to join, and the
castings should be duly thickened at flattened and curved parts. The
inner entrances should be well rounded, in order that there may be as
little frictional loss as possible. All tees, ells, and plugs, when laid,
should be thoroughly backed with stones or masonry, to help take up
the thrust of the water. It is also well to use some locking device, to
fasten the specials firmly to the pipes.
Gates should be subjected before leaving the shop to the same test
for strength as the pipes, and under such test should prove themselves
to be reasonably tight, nothing more than a very slight leakage being
permissible. They should be so constructed as to require at least ten
complete revolutions of the screw to open or close them, and before
allowing them to go into the work, they should be tested to see if they
meet this requirement. A uniform system as to the location of the
gates in the distribution should be strictly adhered to, and probably the
best plan is to set them at street intersections truly on the block lines.
Each gate should be enclosed in a gate box, or if large, in a masonry
manhole provided with a suitable cover.


The Technic.
Hydrants should also be subjected to a successful test of 300 pounds
hydraulic pressure per square inch before leaving the shop, and should
require at least ten complete revolutions of the screw to close them.
The stand pipe and valve openings should be large, so that the loss of
head by friction in the hydrant itself may be kept as small as possible.
The length of the stand pipe should be such that when the hydrant is
properly set with reference to the pavement line, the top of the pipe
connecting with the street main, at the point where it is joined to the
base of the hydrant, shall be a few inches higher than the top of the street
main itself. Care should be taken to see that the hydrant nozzles are
made to fit the couplings on the hose belonging to the town. The con-
necting pipe from the street main should not be of a less diameter than
six inches, and if the hydrant is provided with a steamer nozzle in addi-
tion to the usual two hose nozzles, it should have a diameter of eight
inches. Hydrants should be set in a truly vertical position, and be
placed on line with the front of the blocks, just inside the edge of the
sidewalk. Each hydrant site should be excavated to a width of two
feet, and to a depth of two feet below base of hydrant. In order to
provide free drainage for the waste water from the hydrant, this hole
should be filled up with loose rock or boulders to a point about two
feet above the base of the hydrant, and the rock filling be covered with
pieces of board to prevent fine material from falling in and filling up
the interstices between the rocks. The hydrant should be compactly
backed, to prevent danger of its being forced from its connection by
water-ram, but care must be exercised in placing the backing to see that
the waste^hole for the escape of the water from the base of the hydrant
is left unobstructed. If hydrant is placed in a manhole, provision
shouldjbe made for the proper drainage of the manhole, in order that
the waste water from the hydrant may cause no trouble.
The construction of the distributing reservoir is generally the most
important part of the entire work, and an assistant engineer should be
present at all times to give points and grades and to see that the work
is done strictly in accordance with the plans and specifications.
No part of the work needs more attention than the construction of
the reservoir embankment, and yet, with the inexperienced, no part is
likely to receive less. The best materials available should be used, and
everything be done to render the embankment solid and impermeable
by watering and rolling the material in irregular layers. Sometimes,
when convenient, herds of goats, sheep, or cattle are driven back and
forth over the embankment to consolidate it thoroughly; and the more
wheeling and walking over it, the better. All sod, stubble, or other
vegetable material should first be removed from the ground for a con-
siderable distance back from the foot of the inside slope, and the sub-
soil be rolled and compacted with a heavy grooved roller. Waste

material should be deposited on the lower side, so as to reinforce the
embankment.
Such masonry work as is necessary should be in every way superior
to that performed by the average mason, and that it shall be impervious
to water is the all important quality. The masonry work should be
thoroughly wet with a hose at least twice a day for not less than a week
after same has been put in place, and oftener if evaporation is great.
No wheeling, walking or working upon fresh work should be allowed.
In the making and laying of concrete, care should be exercised to
see that the materials used are clean and good; that they are tho-
roughly mixed in the proper proportions; that, before mixing, the stone
or gravel be wet with clean water; that just the necessary quantity of
water be used in mixing the mortar, and no more; that the ramming be
only sufficient to thoroughly consolidate the materials, and not so severe
as to cause the stone or gravel to settle to the bottom and the mortar to
be forced to the top; that in doing the ramming, concrete previously
laid be not disturbed; that before any layer be covered by another its
surface, if dry, be well sprinkled with water to secure a good bond. In
hot, dry weather it is advisable, in addition to wetting it, to protect con-
crete by covering from the sun.
What is said in the above paragraph about concrete may also be
said in a general way of other masonry work. The mortar should be
first class in every respect; the stones used should be cleaned and mois-
tened with clean water; they should be well bedded and bonded; all
voids should be compactly filled with spawls and mortar; joints should
be close and be broken both horizontally and vertically; and no stones
should be moved after the mortar has begun to set.
Great care is necessary in the making of clay puddle. When prop-
erly made it is nearly as valuable a material as concrete, but when care-
lessly made it may be worse than useless. The materials used should
be carefully selected, properly proportioned, and thoroughly com-
pacted. If the compacting is done by ramming, the surface of each
layer should be deeply scored to make bond with the succeeding layer;
if by rolling, a heavy grooved roller should be used.
In the whole-process of the design and construction of a reservoir,
the engineer should bear in mind the fact that "water abhors an
angle," and should lose no opportunity to put one in its way whenever
it is likely to try to force a passage out. The utmost care must be used
to prevent the water following along the pipes in the entry trench, by
enclosing them in masonry and building cut off walls across them at
intervals. Water is the most subtle enemy with which an engineer has
to deal, and every precaution known to man must be taken to prevent
its working through the embankment—even then the work may result
in partial failure. R. C. GIemmell, '84.

A FEW WORDS FROM A LANDSCAPE GARDENER.
Landscape gardening has for its object the preservation and devel-
opment of outdoor beauty. I am glad of this opportunity to make a
plea to engineers for the preservation of pleasing features in our land-
scape, because engineers and surveyors may exert so much influence in
this direction. An enumeration of a few cases where unnecessary dam-
age has been done will serve to introduce the subject. A piece of land
was purchased for its fine trees, a rapid stream of water that flowed
through it, and its proximity to Lake Michigan. A surveyor was en-
gaged to determine the boundary of the tract. One of the lines which
he ran for this purpose happened to pass through an old red cedar,
which the axman did not hesitate to mutilate by cutting off half the
branches. The tree had stood by itself and was exceptionally perfect.
If its value as an ornamental tree could be given in dollars and cents
(but this is a poor way of estimating the value of such a tree) it would
be placed at from fifty to one hundred dollars. Cutting the tree saved,
perhaps, half an hour's time for the surveyor.
A few years since, in visiting a suburb of Chicago, which was for-
tunate enough to have a native forest growth, I was pleased to see that
some of the original trees had been left along the roadside. An old
oak with a thornapple tree that stood near, made a delightful group.
There were also maples, lindens and hickories. When I saw this street
a year or two later it had been improved (?). Its grade had been
changed slightly and the fine old trees, in picturesque groups, were re-
moved to make room for straight rows of little elms.
In one of the older cities in New York maples, elms and other trees
were planted at an early day. They were placed from fifteen to twenty
feet apart in rows on each side of the street. In a few years they
crowded each other and shut out light and air from the houses, so the
lower branches were cut off, and this process of trimming went on until
in many cases the naked trunks, with ugly scars, where the branches
had been removed, reached above the second story windows. The
upper branches spread across the street and over the houses, completely
shading everything but the back yards.
In the outskirts of another city in New York lived a man whose
grounds along the street boundary were fringed with native dogwoods,
sumachs, Juneberries, witch hazel and sassafrass, with here and there a.


47
wild grape or virgin's bower. In certain nooks golden rods and wild
asters found homes, so that this group of native growth formed as in-
teresting a collection of foliage and flowers as could be found along the
highways for miles. But one day the fever for improvement seized the
owner of the land and he had all the "brush" grubbed out. He then
hailed a passing acquaintance who, he knew, had some skill and good
taste in planting, informing him that he wished to plant some shrubs
and would like his assistance in selecting and arranging them. The
man of taste replied that it would take ten years to produce an effect of
shubbery as good as that which had just been destroyed.
I mention trees and shrubs first, because they are the materials with
which a landscape gardener works—his paints. There are, however,
other features over which the engineer has entire control—features
which have much to do with the appearance and comfort of our sur-
roundings, and hence, come within range of the landscape gardener's
criticism. These are grades, location of catch basins, sidewalks, curb-
ing and frequently the location of the street itself. How often do we
see profiles made with straight lines, frequently perfectly level, when
a slight curve would save expense, keep the road bed drier, and im-
prove the appearance of the street. Catch basins for receiving the sur-
face water are very generally placed at street intersections, making
unnecessary steps at crossings and often obstructing these crossings
with water during heavy rains. There will seldom be any difficulty in
placing catch basins at some distance from corners, thus keeping the
passageway for those on foot high and dry. Again, sidewalks are
usually made to follow the grade of the roadway, when there is no real
reason why they should do so, excepting the desire of the engineer to
simplify his own work. In residence districts streets are usually sixty-
six feet wide, thus leaving a space of six to ten feet in width for grass
and trees between the road-bed and the sidewalk. Where entrance
drives to private grounds are not desired, no harm comes from leaving
the sidewalk one, two, or even three feet above the street grade. Such
an arrangement would frequently save fine old trees and also the ex-
pense of regrading and planting residence grounds. The steeper slopes
could be covered with hardy shrubs, which would give a pleasingly
varied and homelike effect.
In one of the most desirable residence districts of Chicago the
streets are nearly all macadamized. Stone curbing separates the mac-
adam from the grass plat. I have just measured this curbing in many
places and find it to project from six to fourteen inches above the ad-
jacent surface of the roadway. In such localities, where driveways
are constructed of gravel, broken stone or asphalt, curbstones are not
only expensive and unsightly but worse than useless. They are


The Technic.
especially dangerous when horses become ifrightened and shy to one
side or run away. They prevent rainwater and melting snow from run-
ning off from the road surface and soaking into the ground on each
side to the great benefit of trees and grass. With a brick or wooden
pavement the curbing is necessary but it should be kept low, a projec-
tion of two inches above the adjacent surface being sufficient.
Having, perhaps, spent enough time in criticism, let us consider
what can be done to make a street attractive. We will assume that a
pleasing variation in grade and proper drainage have been secured, and
that, while the grade is an easy one, it has been laced so low as to do
the least damage and be of the greatest benefit to the property on each
side. It is nearly always desirable to have residence lots somewhat
higher than the street. The appearance is also improved by having the
houses placed some distance back from the lot line. While it is by no
means essential that all houses should be placed the same distance
from the street line, it is a wise measure to have a line established in
front of which no building can be erected. Houses can sometimes be
built at various distances back of this line with good effect. When the
grade is properly taken care of and the houses correctly placed, the
planting can be commenced. Care should be taken not to plant in such
a way as to keep sunlight out of the windows, and some open spaces
along the street give to it a better appearance than it would have in
continuous shade. The planting of shrubs and vines about verandas
and along the blank walls of buildings, will help to make them attract-
ive and homelike, but this is a matter for individual taste. The street
planting ought to be designed with a view to its effect as a whole. The
United States is wonderfully rich in its variety of trees and shrubs, very
few of which are unattractive or objectionable. A walk of a mile or
two along a suburban or village street ought to show ail the variety of
tree growth, shrubbery and hardy herbaceous plants that can be found
in the surrounding country or in the best parks exclusive of their
greenhouse and aquatic plants. The upper outline of the planting
should drop here and there, showing an expanse of clouds or sky, a
beautiful house or attractive grounds. This variation can be made by
using for the taller trees, elms, maples, oaks, beeches, lindens, tulip
trees, honey locusts and many others. These should be placed in
irregular groups, such an arrangement being far more pleasing than
straight rows and the only arrangement which would admit of the se-
lection of different species. Trees placed in a row should be of one
kind, at least for one block, and as nearly alike as possible. For a
smaller growth use Juneberry, sassafras, red bud, the larger dogwoods,
the various thorns, blue beech, ironwood, etc. These are all beautiful
trees and will often shade a sidewalk while allowing the sunshine to


49
reach the house. Then I would urge the use of a still smaller growth,
such as witch hazel, sumachs, including rhus aromatica, the smaller
sized dogwoods with red bark, barberries, Japan quince, buckthorns,
syringas, sweet briar, etc. These will hide, to some extent, the naked
trunks of trees and give a soft, varied outline to a street view. They
separate the sidewalk from the driveway, giving an agreeable seclusion.
They help to make a beautiful and interesting walk from the railway
station or office to our homes at all seasons of the year—in spring and
summer, with the variety and freshness of their foliage and flowers,
which are placed where they are most easily seen; in autumn, with
their foliage and fruits, and in winter, with the soft colors and fine
spray of their branches. Finally, I would recommend the use of hardy
perennial herbaceous plants—snowdrops, crocuses, hepaticas, trilliums,
lupines, golden rods, wild sunflowers, asters, etc. It will be said, of
■course, that these flowers as well as those of the shrubs will be picked
and the plants destroyed. The same objection was urged in regard to
flowers in public parks, before these parks came into existence and
proved that such fears were for the most part groundless. To learn to
enjoy a flower without picking it and to see or hear a bird without wish-
ing to throw a stone at it, should be a par; of every child's education
—yes, and of every grown person's too. At more or less rare intervals
we go miles to enjoy the beauties of a park, and this is quite right and
justifiable. But how much enjoyment would be added to our lives if
we could have these beauties distributed along the streets that lead
to our dwelling places, where we would see them every day; and not
to our lives only, but to those of strangers and visitors, who, after
seeing how attractive a public thoroughfare might be made, would
perhaps imitate the example in their own neighborhood.
The general public has not yet learned to appreciate what a very
useful person a landscape gardener is. They fail to recognize the fact
that by following his suggestions they save money, enhance the value
of their property, and, what is of more importance, add to the pleasure
of living. The landscape gardener's name does not appear on the city
pay rolls, but the engineer has a hold on the public, and so I appeal to
him to give more thought to the artistic side of his profession. If there
are natural variations of surface, running brooks, ledges of rock, fine
old trees, groups of shrubs, or any other features of natural beauty, let
the engineer study out a way to preserve them, without in any degree
lessening the usefulness of his own work.
I believe there is at the present time a tendency toward greater
appreciation and love of art. Let me close this paper with the hope
that all who read it will try to help forward this movement and give
special attention to "Art out of doors." O. 0. Simonds.

RAILWAY SIGNALING.
DWIGHT C. MORGAN.
Necessity for the safer and more efficient movement- of traffic on
many of the important railway systems of our country, has developed
in railway operation a department of signaling, the functions of which
are to expedite the movement of trains, avoid confusion, and most
important of all, to prevent collisions.
The great growth of our railway systems reaching out to competi-
tive points combined with the public demand upon the companies, has
resulted in the inauguration of fast service for both passengers and
freight, introducing dangers which in the interest of public safety must
needs be obviated. The development of signaling brought about by these
conditions, is so broad in its application that it can properly be divided
into two general classes, block signals and inter-locking devices; the
first for the proper spacing of trains where traffic is dense, the second
for the protection of trains against collision and disaster at grade cross-
ings and draw bridges, and to facilitate train movement in yards and at
junctions, a brief description being given of the latter class of safety
appliances.
Signaling devices seem to have had a very fascinating attraction for
the inventive faculty as patent applications and patents granted devices
of this character approximate very nearly the great number for car-
couplers and rail-joints. A great deal of time and ingenuity has been
expended in bringing the mechanics of signaling to a degree able to
meet the complex and exacting demands of the present railway service
and to-day the most advanced forms of signaling found are those which
are simple and natural.
Signaling is not a new idea; it was first introduced shortly after the
introduction of steam as a motive power on railroads, as the importance
of devising some plan which would lessen the liability to collision
between trains became apparent. In its first stages it was confined to
codes of signals between the trainmen of one train and those of another,
or between the trainmen and a man stationed on the ground giving
hand signals. Practical experience soon demonstrated that this means
only governed a small portion of the prolific sources of danger, and in
the efforts to remedy the existing evils a great many designs for railway


51
signals were brought into service, but in their construction, operation
and designation the diversity was so great that a signal on one line of
road indicating safety, would be almost identical with the danger signal
on another line of road, thus causing a great deal of hazardous confusion.
After numerous serious accidents the managers of the various roads
took up the question of adopting a standard signal which should mean
the same on all roads: the result of their investigation was the general
adoption of the semaphore type of signal. However, this decision was
not unanimous and even at the present day some older forms of signals
may still be seen. The semaphore signal was one of the first of the
mechanical signals, being introduced as early as the year 1840.
The first attempts at interlocking wer.e made in England in 1841
shortly after the introduction of the semaphore signal, when levers for
operating,systems of switches and signals began to be concentrated at a
central point, having in view safety and economy; but with the appli-
cation of this idea came the new danger from the liability of the man
operating the levers to become confused and throw the wrong lever.
Accidents caused by this defect resulted in the enactment of restrain-
ing laws until provision had been made preventing the operator from
throwing the wrong lever or giving wrong- or conflicting signals.
Interlocking in its earliest stages was confined to those levers oper-
ating signals alone and which were in no way interlocked with the
levers operating switches. Interlocking the levers operating both
switches and signals soon followed, and devices of this character have
from time to time been improved in various ways until the present day.
Interlocking has long been an important factor in the operation of
English railways, though English practice varies materially from the
practice in this country. The many factors and conditions affecting the
operation of English and American railways justify the existing differ-
ences. In England fifty-eight per cent, of the railroads are double track
and ninety per cent, of the railroad mileage is operated under the abso-
lute block system. In this country only six per cent, of the mileage is
double track and five per cent, protected with block systems. One of
the principal differences in a comparison of the interlocking devices as
operated here and in England is the use of the facing point or derailing
switch. Derailing switches are almost unknown in English practice
owing to the very complete application of signaling on the railways,
severe discipline and enforcement of penalty in case of disregard, all of
which enable modifications not applicable to our railways in their pres-
ent partially equipped condition with respect to signaling devices. The
derailing point is therefore, an essential feature in American practice at
the present time, and it is usually located about three hundred feet in
advance of the fouling point which it protects.


The Technic.
The first interlocking device in this country was installed in 1874 at
■Spuyten Duyvil Junction in New York City, on the New York Central
and Hudson Kiver Kailroad, where it remained in service about four-
teen years. Progress in the introduction of interlocking was very slow
up to the year 1887, since which time investigation as to its uses and ad-
vantages has resulted in a marvelous growth.
Many of the states, some years since, passed laws, compelling rail-
road companies to bring their trains to a full stop before crossing a
draw bridge or grade crossing. These laws, based upon just and reason-
able considerations for the traveling public, have been found very
irksome in many instances, not only on account of the cost of the stop
made necessary by their enforcement, but from the delay caused by
stopping passenger and heavy freight trains at such places, of which
there are so many in this country.
Interlocking devices may be divided into two general classes, those
operated by hand from the tower as straight mechanical machines, and
those to which power is applied by hydraulics, pneumatics, electricity,
or a combination of them; and the conditions'affecting the tracks to be
equipped, determine, to a large extent, which of the two classes is most
applicable. The practice of signaling in this country at the present
time is quite uniform as regards position of signal for safety and
danger, also in the fact that the signals point to the right of the track
governed, danger being displayed by the arm held in a horizontal posi-
tion, and safety by an inclination of the arm sixty degrees or more
from the horizontal; the home signal arms are usually painted red,
distant signal arms, green. The practice of position of signal by day
and color of signal light by night was generally accepted some years
ago and is considered to-day the best practice by the most experienced
officers. Red light indicating danger, green light caution and white
light, clear.
The efficiency of the signal lamp is of far greater importance than
the color displayed on the signal arm, which governs by position rather
than color. In the use of the signal lamp color alone must be de-
pended upon and the intensity of the light should be the distinguish-
ing feature, and in this connection English practice at the present time
is much in advance of ours, as their lamps are larger and give a clearer
and more efficient light.
Grade crossings, when not complicated with sidings or "Y"
switches, are protected by the most simple kind of interlocking. They
require derailing switches, facing point locks and home and distant
signals in each direction, as shown in diagram No. 1, which also gives
the relative distances from the crossing of the various functions of the
device and the number of levers required to operate it.

Diagram No. 3 shows a double track junction, requiring an eight
lever interlocking machine to work the two switches, one facing point
lock, four home and three distant signals. It is always considered a
great convenience to have a cross-overat every tower, and at these junc-
tions the angle of the crossing frogs is generally such that a single
slip switch may be put in as shown in dotted lines. This will give alL


The Technic.
the convenience necessary and require no extra frogs in the track, and
it can be operated with one additional lever.
The diversity in track conditions affecting the construction and
operation of interlocking devices is so great that conditions often arise
which must be overcome by a safe as well as an economical arrange-
ment of the functions,—as for example where diverging tracks exist it
is customary to use two signal arms on the same post (see diagram 3,
signal number 2), but in all instances the top arm governs the high
speed or through route, the lower arm diverging route or routes. In
many cases crossings are so complicated that large machines are
required, there being a number in service in Illinois having from
seventy to ninety working levers. The locking of such machines is
very intricate.
Diagram No. 5 is a perspective view of the back elevation of an
eight lever machine showing all levers in a normal position, except
numbers 1 and 2 which are reversed. All parts of the machine below
the line of elevation marked B are beneath the Moor of the tower includ-
ing the locking of the machine which is shown by the tappets marked
H; its vertical position beneath the floor protects it from dust and makes
it easy to alter in case of changes in the arrangement of switches and
signals.
The vertical and radial movements of the latch D are communi-
cated to the locking tappet H by means of the connecting link and
rocker H2, centered at H3, to the brackets H„ one of which is secured to
each lever. The locking tappets H are connected to the reversing rocker
H2 by a friction roller, which fits the radial slot in the rocker and is cen-
tered in the tappet jaw H5.
One lever (No. 1) is said to lock another lever (No. 4) when the mov-
ing of No. 1 from its normal position prevents the moving of No. 4 from
its normal position. One lever (No. 2) is said to release another lever
(No. 1) when No. 2 must be completely moved over from its normal
position before No. 1 can be moved from its normal position. Gener-
ally the following is understood—namely, that when 1 locks 4, 4 also
locks 1, and when 2 releases 1, 1 back locks 2. As an illustration, the
principle is the same as that of a bank lock, certain combinations releas-
ing the lock. The towerman by reversing certain levers, each lever by
means of pipe connections, moving a switch, derail or some function, by
the complete combination releases the lock controlling the signal.
Normally the signals are locked directly by the levers controlling
the functions, of which they are indicative; the levers operating func-
tions on conflicting routes interlock each other. The signal lever there-
fore, is always the last lever to be reversed, and in a properly con-
structed device it is always locked in the danger position until the levers


moving the switches and derails which it controls have been set in the
proper position for the train movement The home signal by the lock-
ing always preceeds the distant signal. If any one lever has been omit-
ted, or a conflicting route not completely blocked the signal lever
remains locked, in other words the route must be clear and safe for the
train to proceed before the signal can be given by the towerman. When
the derails and switches have been set in the proper position the home
signal lever is free to be moved and when reversed, it in turn locks all
the levers used in the combination which were necessary to release it,
and in addition releases the lock controlling the distant signal, which
when reversed in turn locks the home signal, therefore, in blocking the
route again the signals must first be returned to the danger position,
(distant signal first) before any of the other levers in the combination
can be unlocked or returned to the normal position, i. e. danger. With
perfect locking, mistakes on the part of the towerman are impossible.
The positive position of signals is universally used which presup-
poses the normal state of the signals and derails to be at danger, and in
that position any one route is free to be cleared, but in setting up a
route for the passage of a train the lever controlling the derails and
switches on all conflicting routes are locked in the danger position by
reversing the first lever in the combination sought, so that the engineer
of a train approaching the crossing while a conflicting route is being
used, by disobeying the signal will have his train derailed. As a further
protection preventing the levers from being changed or moved during
the time a train is occupying a crossing, the "detector bar" is used;
this bar, one-fourth inch thick, two and one-half inches wide and about
forty-four feet in length, is connected with, and works in conjunction
with derails, switches and movable point frogs; its position is on the
outside and flush with the top of the track rail adjacent to each switch
and derail. This bar moves in a vertical plane so that reversing the
lever controlling a switch or derail at the same time raises the bar on a
half stroke, about one inch above the top of the rail, a full stroke of the
lever returning the detector bar to its normal position flush with the top
of the rail, its movement also locking the derail or switch in position by
means of a facing point lock. This bar is of sufficient length so that at
all times at least one pair of wheels of a passing car or engine is contin-
ually bearing upon the rail within its length, the tread of the wheel pre-
venting the detector bar from being moved in its vertical plane, there-
fore taking it out of the power of the towerman to change the position
of any switch or derail while a train is passing. The importance of this
as a protection against confusion or maliciousness on the part of the
towerman is evident.
In diagram No. 1 the modus operandi of clearing the north and


57
south route is as follows: first, all levers on the east and west route
must be normal, which requires all functions to be in the danger posi-
tion, else levers controlling the north and south route are locked by
them. All levers being in the normal position the order of reversing to
clear for a north bound movement is then as follows, (the number of
the lever corresponding with the nnmber of the function which it
controls). Reversing lever number 6 closes both derails and locks them
by means of a facing point lock and detector bar, located at each de-
railing point, at the same time a locking bar between the tappets,
marked II in diagram 5, has locked the lever controlling the derails on
the east and west route open or in the danger position. Reversing No.
4 clears the home signal and at the same time locks signal No. 7 against
a south bound movement. No. 8 is also locked, as No. 7 must be clear
in order to get No. 8. Reversing No. 3 clears the distant signal and the
route is complete. Returning No. 3 and No. 4 to the normal position
releases the lock controlling No. 7 and when cleared it in turn back
locks No. 4 and releases No. S, which reversed gives a clear south
bound route; at all times the east and west route has been blocked.
The reverse conditions are true when the east or west route is cleared.
Long practice and experience in the construction and operation of
devices of this character has enabled reaching a degree of perfection
so complete, even in the most complicated applications, that in denning
a perfect interlocking machine of to-day, it is one so arranged that it is
not within the power of the towerman to organize an accident. This
factor combined with simplicity, compactness and the strength of the
various parts of the machine, establish its degree of perfection.
The importance of interlocking and block signaling to the railway
companies in facilitating the convenient, prompt, and safe movement
of trains becomes more apparent as the advantages of the present
equipment throughout this country during the past few years demon-
strates, and while at the present time our railways are just fairly under
way in the installation of safety devices of this character the import-
ance of more complete application is manifest. Statistics show that
nearly fifty per cent, of the train accidents in this country are due to
collisions; therefore, there is great necessity for overcoming the dangers,
incident to train movements as fully and promptly as practicable.

CAMS AND CAM ROLLS.
To cams and cam rolls—especially the latter—little space is given in
our standard text and reference books, and much of this matter is not
very practicable so that one may be pardoned for adding to the litera-
ture already in existence bearing on this subject.
Of late much has been written--on cam rolls in particular—in one
of our best technical journals, and it is from this source as well as from
personal experience and observation that the substance of this paper is
taken.
Goodeve in his "Elements of Mechanism" defines cam as a term
applied to a curved plate or groove which communicates motion to
another piece by the action of its curved edge.
If one were disposed to be critical to such an extent as to question
its necessarily being a plate or giving motion to another piece, the word
cam would have to be given a still broader definition.
A cam, then, would be a piece having a curved edge or groove,
which communicates motion, relative to itself, to another piece by the
action of that edge or groove.
Of rotating cams one might conceive of two general classes, (I) those
that produce motion transverse to the axis of rotation, and (2) those that
produce motion parallel (or approximately so) to it.
More commonly, however, they are thought of as belonging to one
of the three following types—(a) " edge " or peripheral cams, (b) "face"
cams or (c) " side" or cylindrical cams.
The first two (a and b) are in the first class, and the third (c) in the
second class.
Cams similar to the above, in which the roll only, the cam only, or
both the roll and cam move, might or might not be allowed in the above
category, so varied and numerous are their possible forms.
Any of the above types, with an infinitely large diameter would be
called "plate"' cams, and of these too one may note an almost endless
variety.
Indeed the number of possible forms cams may take is unlimited,
so that the definition of the term must needs be broad and comprehen-
sive.
The writer thinks his ideas of cams have enlarged a little since the
time, when a boy, he would study the cam that operated the thread-
take-up arm on a sewing machine and slyly tip back the head of the


59
machine when his mother was not about, to see how the feed cam could
both raise the feeding bar and then push it along. He would have
found that there were more than two kinds of cams had he dared take
off the front of the needle bar head and had seen the plate cam on the
needle bar.
Without attempting to,add to the meager classification a.bove noted,
one may well look at a few examples of cams and rolls and study each,
both as to its advantages and shortcomings.
The Edge cam, Fig. I, gives motion in one direction only—usually
away from its axis; a weight, or gravity, a spring or another cam is nec-
essary to keep at times, the roll in contact with the cam. It is the sim-
plest and one of the best forms of cams, easily designed, and if of cast
metal, cheaply made. One advantage of ihe edge—or any single acting
cam is that the roll is caused to revolve continually in one direction, and
hence is less liable to " stick" on the pin and slide on the cams than
one whose motion is stopped and reversed several times perhaps in each
revolution of the cam. Another advantage lies in this, that the roll can
be longer than the width of the cam edge, which means that in use the
edge will wear evenly across its whole face, and that the roll will rotate
more easily and certainly as set forth under " Rolls." See Fig. 12.
It is often desirable or necessary on account of wear to smooth the
edge, or change or correct the outline, and this may be easily done by
filing, which in the case of solid face or side cams is well nigh impossi-
ble. It is also a comparatively easy mat'er to set in a steel piece in
repairing, and restore the proper outline.
Another point of superiority which the writer sees in edge cams is
their simplicity and cheapness—especially when of cast metal—com-
pared with that of the other types, and the dispatch with which they
may be made.
In Fig. 11 is shown a cast iron cam that well illustrates the idea.
All the machine work needed is the boring of the hole, the turning of
each face of what might be called the hub, and the drilling of a hole by
which the cam is driven. It may be mounted as shown on a shaft S,
carrying a flange F, or—as it is sometimes called—a cam carrier.
The roughness of the edge is taken off by filing or polishing with-
out cutting beneath the surface or "skin" of the casting. This skin
withstands the pressure of the roll much better than the milled groove
in a face or side cam
The pattern from which the casting is made may be merely a flat
piece cut out to the outline marked by the draftsman. Brass rings
attached at H serve for hubs.
Records kept by the writer show that sets of three of these cams
cost but from one-fourth to one-third as much as do single side cams


that accomplished the same work, and duplicates or repairs may be
made proportionately cheaper as the cost of pattern does not then enter
into the account.
As to the means to be employed to keep the roll at all times in con-
tact with the cam, conditions dictate largely which shall be used.
The use of a weight is restricted to a slowly moving cam with easy
changes between the several "runs" or movements, notably in Fig. 1
at A, B, L and Q. Even then when the parts are of cast iron and in
themselves necessarily heavy, the inertia of the moving parts—often
aside from the weight—is liable to cause at times a crushing pressure at
the line of contact between the cam and roll. A cam working under
these conditions is sure to lose its shape at those points subjected to
hard work.
Where the parts given motion by a cam are favorably placed and
move freely enough, gravity acting on these alone may answer the pur-
pose, and the movement of the cam may be more rapid than in the pre-
vious case, dependent of course on the quickness of cam runs and the
weight of the moved parts.
Next to a positive means of contact of cam and roll through the use
of a second cam (see Figs. 4 and 6) a spring seems best suited to the pur-
pose, if of sufficient length it will give a nearly uniform pressure of
the roll against the cam: its inertia amounts to little or nothing; its
action is quick, permitting quicker runs and more abrupt changes of
motion on the cam, and a greater cam speed than is possible in the cases
above mentioned. It affords too what is often very desirable, a means
of safety, which with a double acting cam would be lacking.
The writer sees its best use in connection with cams which give slow
forward movements, during which various operations are performed,
but allow quick returns of the moving parts by springs, thereby saving
considerable time as well as more complicated cams which would other-
wise be necessary.
The cam in Fig. 20 is an example and is spoken of further in the
remarks on cam designs.
Where a positive motion is demanded, two edge cams acting con-
jointly seem a better means of securing it than either the face or side
cam.
Two ways of accomplishing this are shown in Figs. 4 and 6. In the
first the cams are on separate shafts connected by gearing so as to move
in accord with each other and preferably as shown by the arrows. This
causes the roll to be rotated always in the same direction.
The second way is in some respects simpler, there being but one cam
shaft and hence no liability to lost motion between the cams due to pos-
sible back lash in the gearing. The cams may be made so that both


rolls are always in contact with them, and thus all slackness is avoided
and without danger of wearing the rolls, as is probable with face or side
cams.
The Face Cam (Fig. 2) is in reality no more than the combination of
an external with an internal edge cam. Such a cam, as shown in Fig.
5, maybe composed of several pieces S, S' and S" of iron or steel, per-
haps hardened, according to the size of the cam and the duty it has to
perform, and attached to a disc C.
In light mechanisms the face cam if properly made and of steel,
especially if hardened or case-hardened, works well at high speeds.
Cast iron face cams in heavier machinery are quite liable to wear
and this liability increases with the looseness of the roll in its groove,
the distance between the roll and the bottom of the grove, the weight
of the moved parts and the speed of the cam.
This is due in part, in those noticed by the writer, to the fact that
the grooves were milled into the solid cam castings which is softer and
looser grained in the interior the heavier the section is, and the softer
and coarser the metal is, the more readily will it flake off under the
action of the roll.
If the roll does not extend to the bottom of the groove, its path is
narrower and the pressure of the roll per inch, on its path is greater,
with the result that the wear will be more rapid in proportion.
With the roll loose in the cam groove there is a chance in the faster
cams of the roll striking the opposite side of the groove a blow at each
angle or turn in the groove, and this is the first step to succeeding trou-
bles and wear in the cam.
The difficulties in this instance may to a great degree be overcome
by the use of " segments" or sections as shown in Fig. 6. These, if of
iron, may be cast the proper shape similar to the edge cams already
spoken of and with the same advantages It is quite feasible to make
the segments as shown in Fig. 13, P and R, with a clearance into which
the roll projects. This conduces to the even wearing of the cam and to
better roll action. This is further spoken of under "Rolls."
Quite large cams may be made in this way with hardened segments
which with practically no wear maintain the smooth action that the cam
originally possessed.
Dirt and small particles of foreign matter are bad enemies of groove
cams. They wedge between the roll and the groove causing the roll to
slide and rub against the sides of the groove, tending to form a little flat
or face on the roll and to imbed the iron particles themselves into the
soft iron. Where in a slowly moving cam it is not required that the roll
fill the groove, the latter may be widened by cutting back the unused side
and thus avoid the trouble just referred to. Cheaper and better still is
the style already spoken of as shown in Fig. 5.


The Technic.
In face cams the roll revolves first in one direction and then in the
other according to the side of the groove it is rolling on, coming to rest
perhaps several times in each revolution of the cam. As the resistance
to starting is more than that to continuous movement the tendency is
for the roll not to start, in which event a small flat is probably formed
on the roll. More are liable to be formed and they grow in time to such
an extent that the roll more frequently slides than rotates. A roll in
this condition wears the cam as well as itself and produces an uneven
motion in the slide or arm which carries it
The Side or Cylindrical Cam (Fig. 3) is in more common if not in
more general use than the two preceding types.
As with face cams the smaller side cams of steel doing light duty
work well. The cam on the balance-wheel shaft of some makes of
sewing machines, that operates the thread take-up arm in the needle
bar head, is a good example of a cam which is often run at very high
speeds.
The larger cams of cast iron are open to the same objections as the
face cam type. Like the latter it is usually a groove cam, cut out of
the solid metal, so that what is said of cast iron face cams will largely
apply here.
Often Side Cams are made of iron or steel sections or cam pieces
fastened to a plain drum. In fact this is customary in one class of ma-
chines in which changes are wanted from time to time in the several
movements produced by the cams. The cam pieces are changed by ad-
justing or replacing by others instead of removing the whole cam and
replacing by another. Cast iron cam pieces, or "segments" as they are
sometimes called, similar to those mentioned under face cams have
been used instead of wrought iron pieces, and very successfully; the
advantage gained in this case is more than in that of the face cam.
Wrought iron pieces must be forged to shape, and to suit the curva-
ture of the cam drum; then smoothed with a file and often where
smoothness of action is desired, they must be trued up in a lathe or
cam cutter after they are on the cam.
Cast iron segments have proved, so far as the writer has ex-
perienced, no more expensive in first cost and much cheaper and more
readily replaced than those of wrought iron, while as in other types of
cams they seem to serve the purpose as well.
In cast iron cams, of the other types as well as this, parts that are
thin or subjected to severe work are sometimes made of steel set into
the iron, as shown at G, fig. 22. Unless carefully placed, however, thi9
is apt to lead to another trouble; that is an unevenness in the edge of
the cam where the iron adjoins the steel, as the iron wears away much
faster than the steel.

Reciprocating Cams. Examples of cams that have a reciprocating
but not rotary motion are shown in figures 7 to 10.
The first three are stop or gauge mechanisms, used to gauge the
length of feed of rods in special iron working machinery.
In the first example the shaft is held from moving longitudinally
but is free to be rotated by means of the sleeve cam S, which is attached
to a sliding carriage but does not rotate. As the cam moves backward
(toward the left) the arm G is thrown up into position; the forward
movement of the cam with the carriage throws the arm down out of
the way of the tools on the carriage.
Figure 8 shows a simpler mechanism. An outside force is needed
to keep the roll against the cam, which, as in the last case, is attached
to and moves with a slide. The stop arm and spring or weight are not
shown.
The third is simpler than either of the others. Here too the cam
is attached to the slide and is shown in the backward position. Move-
ment of the cam toward the right throws the stop, which is connected
through the pin-block P to the arm L, out of the way.
Another example of a reciprocating cam is illustrated in principle
in fig. 10 and is the needle bar cam common in sewing machines.
In the position shown, with the shaft revolving counter-clockwise,
the cam and bar will rise until the roll reaches the apex of the cam;
then it will descend until the roll has passed about 45° beyond. It will
then rise with the roll to the latter's highest point and then descend
until the roll comes to about the position shown.
The short rise about to be given the needle-bar serves to make a
loop in the thread into which the shuttle point may enter.
A cam of this kind made of a U instead of a Ar shape as shown,
with the radius of the U the same as the distance of the roll from the
center of the shaft, will give a period of rest to the bar and to itself
while the roll is passing the length of the U, when the shaft is on the
concave side of the cam, as then the centers of the shaft and U
coincide.
Cam Rolls and Pins. It is probable that the style of roll and pin in
most common use is a plain cylindrical roll on a pin projecting from an
arm or slide, as shown in figs. 13, 2 and 3. The diameter of the pin
should be as small as possible and have the necessary strength. Its
length should be as great as the roll and groove (if a side or face cam
—will permit, so as to get the requisite bearing surface for the roll. A
long journal also retains the lubricant better than a short one. The
diameter of the pin governs the length of it to some extent, as the t&gt;in
may be treated as a beam fixed at one end and weighted at the other
(when the pressure comes at the outer end of the roll). Not that this


The Technic.
ought to be, as that would tend to, drive the oil from between the pin
and roll and conduce to the cutting of the bearing, but that it may
happen. The roll should ordinarily be as small as conditions will per-
mit and its length of bearing on the pin as liberal as the depth of
groove will allow. Many rolls are so small, however, as to be mere
shells and naturally would give much trouble by their refusal always
to do their duty—to rotate.
So far as his own experience is concerned the writer has found that
rolls of twice the pin diameter can with reasonable certainty be relied
on to rotate and in practice has taken this as a minimum diameter.
Often the roll may be made much larger and yet have the quick-
ness of action desired. Inertia of the rapidly moved parts often dic-
tates that the roll as well as the other parts, be small and sharpness of
action always does. It must be remembered that the path of the pin,
when the roll is rounding a corner of the cam, is an arc, whose radius
equals that of the roll and hence the sharper the action is desired at
such points the smaller the roll must be.
In order to have an even bearing on the pin the roll must bear at
about the middle of its length on the cam, and to effect this several
means have been employed.
Common among these is the barrel-shaped roll, shown in fig. 15, in
a tilted position relative to the cam. This roll may be used with steel
cams but not then on heavy work, as it wears a concave path in the
groove if not hardened, which causes sliding friction between the roll
and its path, as the former at different diameters is in contact with the
latter.
In roughly built machinery it would answer better than a cylindrical
roll, as it would adjust itself to the probable unevenness therein and
ill-adjusted parts, where the cylindrical roll would be likely to bind or
cramp.
In figure 8 a barrel roll would be the proper one to use if the edge
of the cam were square with its sides instead of being inclined to suit
the swing of the roll arm.
The style of cam pieces in fig. 13, mentioned also under side cams,
has more than one advantage.
Primarily they present a track to the middle of the roll and pre-
vent the possibility of the latter bearing at the ends of its tread on the
cam. The wear is also more even across the faces of the pieces and the
objectionable fillets formed at F, fig. 2, in a milled groove, by unequal
wear are avoided.
The same shape of groove may, of course, be obtained in a cam cut
out of the solid metal by the proper shaped milling cutter; or by mak-


ing the rim or face of the cam casting equal in thickness to the depth
of the groove (maintaining the strength of the cam by several broad
arms or ribs) and milling the groove through it the same object is
attained.
Still another means of maintaining a uniform pressure between
roll and pin is the long roll placed as in fig. 12. In the long bearing
the oil will be well retained and distributed, the use of a small long pin
being possible by the support it has at each end in the double arm, and
sufficient bearing surface being had through its liberal length.
The small diameter of the pin also admits of using a small roll
with the advantage noted above.
The merits claimed for this double arm arrangement are warranted
the writer thinks by the success he has experienced with it.
A valuable suggestion was made to him some time ago regarding an
improvement in the roll which is explained by Fig. 14. The roll itself
A is made of cast steel—not hardened—and is bushed with a hardened
steel hub B, a trifle longer than the roll. The roll not being hardened
gets a surer hold on the cam than a smoothly worn hardened roll
could, and being of cast steel it will withstand the pressure of the cam;
the hardened bushing affords a splendid bearing; and its projecting
ends prevent the body of the rolls from coming into contact with the
arms carrying the pin. The result is a roll which ought to rotate under
almost any conditions.
Conical Rolls—The use of a conical roll instead of a plain roll in
connection with a side cam has been urged by some writers, the argu-
ment being, that if the elements of the roll surface and the surface of
the side of the groove meet at the intersection of the axis of the roll
and cam, the element of sliding friction between roll and cam is elimin-
ated, and the resulting wear is that due purely to the friction of rolling
contact. It is usually illustrated by a cut similar to Fig. 16, which shows
plainly enough that the reasoning is correct, at least when the groove
is in a plane perpendicular to the cam axis.
Suppose, however, that a section F G where the path of the groove
is a helix, the angle of which is 45°, be taken of the cam and roll. If
in Fig. 18 showing such a section, the elements of the roll be made to
pass through the center 1, of curvature of the ellipse at S, the contact
between roll and cam, will here too, be rolling and not sliding.
The taper of the roll, however, is not the same as when the groove
is in the plane at right angles to the cam axis. And one finds that the
elements of the cone become more nearly parallel as the angle of the
center line of groove with the axis of the cam grows less, until when the
groove is parallel to the axis the center of curvature is at an infinite
distance and the conical roll becomes cylindrical.


Im: Tj-xhxic.
While the conical roll has perfect rolling contact with the cam in
• one position only of the groove, an average helical angle of the groove
■center line may be taken (say 2o° with the plane perpendicular to the
cam axis), such that the roll tapered to the center of curvature of the
outer edge of the groove at this angle, will not experience much sliding
friction between the limits T C and F G, Fig. 10.
The radius of curvature in this case is about 1 22 times the diameter
of the cam and the center of curvature located this distance below the
point T, Fig. 17 is the apex M of the cone of which the roll is a frustum.
Where it is desired that the roll shall fill the groove without lost
motion, the conical roll offers a means of adjustment provided the
wear of the cam groove is tolerably uniform.
Cam Design.— One may think of a cam design as having passed
through two stages;—first, the construction of the diagram, or founda-
tion frame so to speak, and second, the plotting of the cam groove or
outline itself upon this frame.
Where but a single cam of a kind is made, the necessary construc-
tion lines for the diagram are drawn along with the mapping of the
groove, as they are required. The better way especially where more
than one cam of a kind is to be drawn, is to build the foundation first,
then the several superstructures are more easily and; quickly con-
structed. It is to the foundation work principally that what follows
will be devoted, and this is made up of the writer's own methods largely.
as up to within a short time he has seen little relative to the subject.
Cylindrical Cam Diagrams.—Taking up the simplest combination—as
far as the diagram is concerned—a cylindrical cam and a roll movable
on a slide parallel to the cam axis, we have in Fig. 22 the developed
surface of the cam, the roll 11 and its path A B J.
The cam sheet is ruled parallel to the travel of the roll into one
hundred equal spaces. One hundred is taken in preference to 360 or
other number on account of convenience, as it is an easy number to
deal with and is the basis of our per cent, and decimal systems.
Assume the greatest angle at which the cam may act on the roll
without undue side pressure on the slide, say 50° as shown in the figure.
This of course determines the sharpest angle of the cam groove.
Suppose that the cam as shown in Fig. 22, has been designed for
some special purpose and platted in the usual way. by points, lines and
angles, the center line first and then the groove lines, and that it be
studied in detail briefly as follows
At D the path makes an angular turn and apparently at C also, if
the center line shows the true path of the roll center. At B the groove
lines meet before they reach the circumference of the roll circle, and
hence there must be some space between B and the roll, and the latter


69-
instead of following the center line as laid out will in rolling on the
point B make that center line an arc at the turn like the one shown at J.
At D although the groove is similar, the roll bears on the arc A of
same radius as itself in making the turn, so that the change is abrupt,
and not by an arc.
At E the turn is easier, being an arc the radius of which is about
three times that of the roll. That at F is the same as that at J and as
that at C should have been.
The groove at F is liable to wear or break away at CJ on account of
the sharp corner, if the metal is iron, making the insertion of a steel
piece necessary; but as previously shown, it is advisable to avoid if pos-
sible the angular corner and the consequent need of inserting steel1
pieces.
The turn at H is very easy, being the arc of a circle of four times-
that of the roll. The path from E to F and'.;from F to H makes the
maximum angle 50°, and that from H to J follows an irregular curve.
Turns such as that at A should be avoided where possible to do so;:
those at C, F and J, are permissible with slow cam velocity, C and J
being better than F as the angle turned is less; the use of turns such as.
at E and H is advisable and at high speeds necessary to the smooth
working and the* life of the cam.
If the cam be used with a roll on an arm instead of a slide, it is
laid off as in fig. 21, c being the roll, cV the arm and KK the locus of
rock shaft centers.
As the angular movement of the arm does not affect the turns in*
the path of the roll materially, what has been noted thereon in fig. 22
will apply in the present case as well.
The general path of the roll is affected, however, by the length of
the arm; the shorter the arm the more will the cam differ from one-
actuating a slide.
The path from M to O shows the effect of the curvature of the or-
dinates when the center line of the path is laid out by points, not so
plainly, however, as when the path makes a sharper angle with the or-
dinates.
From O to P trie groove is so laid out as to act through the roll on a
virtual arm cW, one-half the length of the actual arm; from F to Q
the virtual arm equals the actual arm and the path being (from its
method of construction) a tractrix can never reach or pass the line KK;
from Q to S the virtual arm is one-third the actual arm; and from T to
U the virtual arm makes an angle of 50° with the actual arm. The
path of the roll may be laid out by points; any part of it, as from T to
U crosses each of the ordinates at the same angle, in this case 50°, the?
same^as that made in fig. 22 by the path from E to F.


The Technic.
If a constant angular velocity is not required a reasonable approxi
mation is obtained by making the path from T to U say, straight. This
is often necessary from the fact that some cam cutting machines can-
not mill a curved groove, as will be noticed under that subject. The
method of laying out the path, say, from P to O is also accomplished
as follows: the roll c, arm Vc, virtual arm VW and the line of action
WX are drawn on a piece of tracing paper, forming the figure VWc.
Draw a short tangent to the roll circle where cut by the line WX on the
side acted on by the cam—in this case at d—and make ad — ab = about
^ the roll diameter. With the center c on the last point in the path al-
ready determined, and the point V on the line KK, with a needle point
prick through a, b, and x into the cam paper. Now place the tracing
paper so that the roll is in the next position as determined by having
the point 6 on the tracing paper over a on the cam paper, and the point
v on the line KK, which will be at v'. Prick through a', c' and x' into
the paper beneath. Continue as above until the desired distance has
been traversed and trace the curves through the points thus obtained.
Edge and Face Cam Diagram. The edge cam only will be dealt
with, as the face cam calls for but the outer edge/of the groove in ad-
dition, and that is readily obtained.
In rig. 20 MN is the least diameter of the edge cam required, BF
the greatest diameter, PT the roll arm, T the roll, and KPR the circle
containing the center of the rock shaft, distant PU from the center of
the cam. The chart is divided, as shown, into 100 equal parts by ap-
proximately radial arcs struck from points in KPR with a radius equal
to PT.
Noting, now, some of the quicker runs in the cam already drawn,
it is seen that they are similar to those in tig 21 and that they may be
constructed in the same way. The edge Ga acts on the roll so that the
virtual is one-half the actual arm; that from I to C acts on a virtual
arm, making an angle of 50° with the actual arm; and that from B to
H acts on a virtual arm of one-fifth the actual.
A virtual arm of one-half the actual arm is not so short as to work
hard and where the duty is light a virtual arm of one third the actual
is long enough to work as easily as a slide with a toll acted upon by a
cam groove at an angle of 50°.
A virtual arm of one-fifth the actual is for the "quick return" only
of the roll and arm by spring and accomplishes the distance BH in .045
of a revolution of the cam, including the easing of the movement at
H by an arc whose radius equals the roll diameter.
To illustrate the numerical calculations for a cam of the style
shown, suppose for example that there are three movements—as of
tools—in succession, as follows:


71
(a) \" movements,while the spindle that holds the material to be oper-
ated upon makes 34 revolutions,
(b) f" movement in 17 revolutions of the spindle.
(c) 2j// movement in 26 revolutions of the spindle.
Tabulating these with the tool changing movements which are
known, we have:

The total time taken to change tools is 50* per cent of the whole
time, hence the sum of the revolutions, 77, must be 49* per cent, and
the total number of revolutions in which to complete the cycle of move-
ments is 155 +.
Of this 34 revolutions are 22 per cent., 17 are 11 per cent, and 26 are
16* per cent, which are entered when found at the rignt of the table
and make of course with the 50* per cent., 100 per cent, or complete
cycle.
In platting the cam the half inch is laid off at OA, which is \ actual
size; B is located .22 from O, the needed points between O and B located
and the curve drawn in. BHI is known and is now drawn. The sec-
ond and third lobes, I D and E F are then drawn in and the cam com-
pleted by making the outlines DNE and F G O similar to B H I.
Complement Edge Cams, Having designed one of a pair of edge
cams, to be used as shown in rig. 6, its complement cam may be con-
structed accurately and very expeditiously, as indicated In rig. 19, by
drawing the first cam and cam arms on separate pieces of tracing
paper and pivoting with needle points the proper distance from each
other, the cam arm sheet under the other and tracing arcs of the com-
plementary cam roll at a as the cam paper is rotated by steps, with the
first cam roll in contact with its cam.
The writer has come to have a great deal of respect for this tracing
paper method of working out this and analogous motions and prob-
lems other than those now under consideration. It does away with a
mass of lines, arcs and points, affords a clearer conception of the prob-
lem and enables different positions of the mechanism to be considered
with advantage.
Cam Cutters. Of these, three kinds will be noted; (a) those in which
the various angles of the path of the cam roll are obtained by means of


The Technic.
change gearing; (6) those employing a templet or former to produce
the desired cam groove; (c) the pattern maker.
The first mentioned can cut only a groove such as S A and A B, fig.
22, devoid of rounded turns as at E, F, or H, and of arcs or irregular
curves, as at H J, fig. 22, M N, N O, O P, P Q, etc., fig. 21.
Other machines similar in principle are sometimes used for cam cut-
ting, especially the universal milling machine; occasionally the lathe is
used where the angles are slight.
The second will cut any outline or groove but requires a templet
sawed or filed to shape by a machinist to the outline laid out by the de-
signer. The designer thus has control over the shape of the cam. In
other words he is not limited by the angles given by change gears as in
the first case.
This style of machine is particularly adapted to small steel cam
work where the templet or pattern may be made much larger than the
cam itself, thereby diminishing the errors in proportion.
An excellent cam cutter of this type is described by its designer,
Mr. W. A. Gabriel, in the American Machinist of Nov. 16, 1893.
As a cam cutter of cams of cast iron—especially edge cams and
cam segments—the pattern maker stands very high so far as the writer's
estimation is concerned, producing, as he can, a pattern quickly and
accurately, and one on which the designer himself may previously lay
out the outline with a knife.
The low cost of duplicate cams as compared with machine cut
cams, as spoken of under edge and side cams renders this method of
cam making invaluable. Cams thus made may be finished to any de-
gree of smoothness at a slight expense of time and labor.
Conclusion. When one reads through the above and sees how little
has been said—and that quite elementary—he will no doubt agree with
the writer in his introductory remark that there is room for more good
literature on the subject. And if he is interested enough in cams to
warrant further reading, it is for him that the following references
are given. Those in the American Machinist are from the pens of prac-
tical men and will be appreciated by those who have had experience
and trouble with cam mechanisms. Experience may be the best teacher
but without a text-book of the experiences and experiments of others
he may often make but slow progress with his pupil; and one misses
part of his education if he does not profit through other's experiences.

HYDRAULIC PILE-DRIVING AT THE INTER-STATE
BRIDGE, EAST OMAHA, NEBRASKA.
In the River and Harbor Improvement Section of the War Depart-
ment Exhibit, Government Building, at the World's Fair, was a very
elaborate model of the Columbia River Improvement plant, showing sec-
tion of jetty tramway, pile-driver, tender car, and dump cars for rock
and brush.
The jetty tramway was a double track 3-ft. gauge railroad 13 feet
centres, over which ran the driver and cars to extend the work. The
driver was built at one end of a framed platform, resting on a turn-
table carried by four trucks and was balanced by the engines, drums,
pumps, etc., at the other end.
The leads were about 60 feet high above platform, or 80 feet above
low tide level, and 'piles from 55 feet to 75 feet were sunk with two jets
of water delivered at the lower end through pipes.' "When piles were
in position in gin with hammer resting on top, pump was started and
pile driven into sand 22 feet, usually in four minutes." Progress, 64 feet
a day or four bents of four piles each with necessary caps and stringers.
This method of hydraulic pile sinking has been used by the govern-
ment engineers in the Missouri and other western rivers and harbors,
when sand and gravel were the only material to penetrate, and the mag-
nitude of the work permitted the expense of the plant.
Judging from the interest shown by the crowds around this model,
a description of a less elaborate driver may be of interest.
The driver about to be described was used in the winter of 1892-3, on
the Inter-State Bridge across the Missouri River, connecting East Omaha
with Council Bluffs, Iowa, and was designed by, built and operated
under the directions of Mr. C. E. H. Campbell, M. Am. Soc. C. E., whot
in connection with the Milwaukee Bridge and Iron Works, had the con-
tract for the pile substructure and combination span and trestle super-
structure for this bridge, and to whose kindness the writer is indebted
for most of the following data.
The bridge was designed by Mr. J. A. L. Waddell, M. Am. Soc. C. E.
as Chief Engineer for the Omaha Bridge and Terminal Ry. Co. It is
1707 feet long, beginning on the Nebraska side with 16 spans of ordinary,
between centres, 5 pile trestle and 12 spans of 23'9// centres, with
7 cypress piles per bent and two in the nose which is planked up and

shod with B. K. iron. There are three combination spans 192 feet c c.
end pins, 30 feet high, 22 c. c. of trusses, with steel chords, ties and floor
beams; the timber throughout the bridge is long-leaf yellow pine from
Louisiana. The four pile piers under these spans have from 40 to 54
cypress piles each, from 50 feet to 70 feet long, well braced together,
and planked up on nose and sides with 4 inch oak plank to above high
water line, and protected on nose, from the ice, by iron plates and B. R.
iron. On the east pier rests the west end of the 520 foot draw-span
built by the Phoenix Bridge Company. This draw span is the longest in
the world, is designed for double track, Waddell's standard engine
loading Class X, and 100 lbs. per sq. foot, on roadways and sidewalks,
and wheji rinished, with its cantilevered roadways, will weigh about four
million lbs, with its electric turning gear, Waddell-Cutz motors and
storage battery, being only exceeded in weight by the four tracked, solid
floor swing span being built over the Harlem river, which is 389 feet long,
and will weigh about 4,400.000 lbs. A detailed description of this draw
with inset, will be found in the Engineering News, of Dec. 7, 1893; and
in the issue of Nov. 23, 1893, is illustrated and described in detail the
construction of the 40 foot in diameter cylindrical pier on which the
draw turns. This pier was sunk, by the open dredging and sand pump
process, by Sooysmith and Company, contractors, 120 feet below low
water to rock foundation. The east approach to the draw consists of 50
feet of trestle. The whole bridge is floored for wagons and provided
with wooden hand rails and one track, and electric motor rails are laid.
The present alignment is skewed to the current so that the permanent
structure can be built on the up stream side and the draw swung into
line when the cantilever roadways will be added and the double tracks
laid.
The pile piers, long trestle bents, draw nose and protection works
contain 471 cypress piles from 50 feet to 70 feet long, or 31,450 lineal feet
of piling, all of which were driven at an average of 15 per full working
day during December, January and February, and the driver dismantled
and safe ashore before the heavy ice went out on which the men worked
all winter.
The driver had a base of 22 feet by 22 feet of heavy framed timbers
on six wheels running on rails laid on heavy timbers, supported by short
piles driven ahead by a small driver and cut off just above the ice. The
top of leads was 80 feet above the ice and leads ran on cross-rails laid on
front of driver, and had a side range of 18 feet. The hammer and guide
cap weighed 3,000 pounds, but often the hammer had to be lifted from
pile and pile held back to check it from sinking too fast or too far. The
engine was a double cylinder inches X 9 inches with vertical boiler,
25 H. P. One friction drum and two winch heads handled all the nece&amp;-


75
sary lines from the falls. The pump was a "Deane" Compound Du-
plex 8 inches — 12 inches — 7 inches X 10 inches; nominal capacity 350
gallons per minute with possibility of 400 gallons per minute.
The total weight of driver, as rigged for work with house over
boiler, pump, etc., was about 30 tons. The heaviest pile handled weighed
7,000 pounds, and was sunk in five minutes.
Water was pumped from the river through a 6 inch suction hose
with strainer, and forced into a 5 inch stand pipe 24 feet high, teed to
two 2£ inch pipes, carried to the front of the driver, to each of which
coupled a 2£ inch 4 ply fire hose, both of which passed over drums and
coupled to the 2J inch pipes, 52 feet long, that were attached one on
each side of the pile by clamps and chains at the top, and at the point
by wrought spikes, bent to hold while driving. These pipes were bent
to fit under point of pile and deliver the water in line with its axis and
nozzled down to from 7-8 inches to 1| inches depending on depth. Max-
imum water pressure for 1 inch nozzle about 80 pounds per square inch.
The piles were red and yellow cypress 50 feet to 70 feet long, 10 inches
tops, 16 inches to 24 inches butts, and were driven, top down, to a max-
imum depth of 50 feet in sand and silt, and through streaks of gravel
and blue clay from one to two feet thick. The pile was slung up to top
of driver by a pair of 14 inches double blocks and 1J inch rope carried to
the winch head of engine, the pipes were attached, hammer rested on
pile, pile lowered through hole in the ice, and the pump started; the
rate of sinking was controlled by slacking off this fall line as fast as the
water cut away the material. When clay, logs, or other obstructions
were encountered and pile stopped sinking, or stuck, the pile and ham-
mer were pulled up about 10 feet, extra pressure applied at the pump
and the pile lowered slowly. One to three times pulling up generally
sufficed to cut away or around the obstruction. If not, the hammer was
used with a fall of 2 or 3 feet to tap pile through the hard streak when
it would continue to sink to position with the jets alone. It was found
that the best results were obtained by giving the water full pressure to
dig the hole ahead of the pile and enough volume to keep the sediment
suspended and flowing up all around the pile, and not allowing the pile
to sink too fast, although at first the hammer was used all the way
down after passing a hard streak; the pile going 6 inches to 2 feet at a
blow, but no time was saved. When in clean sand and silt the piles
would sink the whole 50 feet in from 3 to 5 minutes, and 8 to 10 minutes
would pass them through a clay streak by pulling up two or three
times. When pile reached proper depth the pump was stopped, the
pipes undamped and pulled up together with the tackle used to lower
the pile, usually in about minutes.
Such a plant as this is ample for ordinary deep driving, and for
work on a large scale will be found much superior, for ordinary depths
even, to the usual drop or steam hammers.


The following data, obtained from observation and practice on this
work, may be of assistance in determining the volume of water, pressure
and size of nozzle required for different depths. Volume required will
approximate 16 gallons per minute per inch of average diameter of pile,
and will be ample for depths, in ordinary sand aad silt, up to 40 feet;
after that increase the volume at the rate of 4 gallons per inch of diam-
eter for every 10 feet of added depth. Example: 70 feet pile; 24 inch
butt; 10 inch top, average 17 inches; 17 X 16 = 272 gallons per minute
up to 40 feet; for 50 feet add 4 X 17 = 68 gallons; or 340 gallons per
minute; for 60 feet 408 gallons per minute.
With pump capacity as thus determined the following sizes of noz-
zles will give sufficient force to cut the material, while the volume will
cause a strong flow upwards all around the pile and it will not bind or
be caved in upon.
For depths of about 20 feet one 2 inch pipe with 1 inch nozzle; for
30 feet one 2£ inch pipe with 1\ inch nozzle will be sufficient, care being
taken that the pipe is bent under the pile end so as to deliver the stream
in line with axis of the pile.
For depths of 40 feet, 50 feet and 60 feet two pipes 2} inches diam-
eter, with nozzles 1J inches, 1 inch and 7-8 inch respectively have given
the best results. C. H. Richmond.

NOTES ON A SYSTEM OF VESSEL DESIGN.
The system of vessel design to which attention is here called is
adapted to the determination, before any drawings are made, of all the
essential elements of a design to fill specified requirements. Only the
method of determining volume of displacement with location of center
of buoyancy will be here touched upon, for the system covers a very
wide field Questions of greatest possible fullness or fineness of form;
of stability in light or loaded trim; of readiness in handling; of econ-
omical speeds and powers, with the many minor ones that arise, go to
make up a formidable list which the naval architect must answer or
attempt to answer before even a preliminary drawing can be made.
Naval architects of experience formulate the results of their work
each in his own way, so as to be most available for comparisons and
estimates on new work, and the system of design called variously by
Chapman's, by Carlsund's, and by Nystrom's names, has grown out of
attempts at such formulation. Chapman, a Swedish engineer, is the
originator of it. He collected drawings of a large number of vessels
whose performance was considered satisfactory in his day (a century
and a half ago), and set to work t» trace the family resemblance, if we
may so term it, which he hoped to find among them. He confined his
attention to investigating the ratios between the greatest or midship
immersed areas of section and the areas at definite fractional intervals
of the lengths of forward and after bodies on each side of midship, for
each vessel. In order to show graphically the relative value of these
areas, he divided each by a constant, the breadth of the vessel at load
water line, reducing them to rectangles of uniform breadth and vary-
ing depth. When the depths were set up to scale as ordinates, the
respective distances of the sections from midship being the abscissae,
the curve through the extremities of the ordinates at once struck him
as being very like a parabola, and he found on examination that his
surmise was nearly correct. Considering the propulsion of a vessel
through the water as a problem in hydraulics, it is not surprising to us
that such should be the case. The slight difference found, for which
he failed to account, made all the difference between success and fail-
ure for his system, and it was reserved for others to complete it.
The parabola, when applied as a curve of transverse areas or as a
■water line, will seldom be of the conventional proportions, as the
abscissa is smaller in relation to the maximum ordinate than in the


true parabola as ordinarily dealt with. The two carves of Figs. 1 and
2, for example, are made by the application of the same formula, using
a different ratio of maximum abscissa to maximum ordinate.
Consider the equation of parabolic form in terms of parameter,
ordinates and abscissae of points on the curve (Fig. 1).
Y= 2 p x.
Now for x, the maximum abscissa, substitute b, the half breadth of
the vessel, or midship immersed area, if it is to be a curve of areas; for
y, the corresponding ordinate, substitute I, the length of forward or
after body of vessel, and we have


79
Solving for p.
Then if we select the ordinate for any other point in the curve,
and let /3 = distance to the center line of the ship,
b — x = ,3
, , by"
and 0 = 6 j 1 -(-f-)" j
(1)
This is the form in which Chapman left the equation, and while it
is useful, its usefulness is limited to a single class of vessels—those
intended only for relatively slow speed. In using it, 6 is equal to half
breadth of vessel if it is desired to calculate a water line, or to the area
of midship section if it is desired to calculate a curve of immersed
areas; I — length of forward or of after body of the vessel, y equals
distance from midship section, and /? equals the ordinate to the curve.
The area of the curve, representing the area of a water line if the
value of 6 is in linear dimensions, and the displacement in cubic units,
if 6 represents to scale the area of the section at the origin (midship),
will be found to be the sum of all the ordinates between the limits I and
o for y, or a = j /3 dy. Substituting the value of /3 from equation (1)

Let us see what are the limitations to the usefulness of this formula
as applied to an area or displacement curve. As seen in equation (3),
for a given displacement and given dimensions of vessel, there can be
only one value of exponent n, and hence only one value for coefficient E
forcenter of gravity. Hence, if we want to make a vessel sharper than
usual, by increasing slightly the areas of sections nearer midship and
decreasing those towards the ends, and still retain the given displace-
ment, we must depart from the areas calculated by the formula. It
allows of only one solution for each set of conditions. For n = 1 the
curve is a straight line (Fig. 3); for n &lt; 1 it is curved toward the axes
(Fig. 4); for n &gt; 1 it is concave towards the axes (Fig. 2). Even Chapman
found that the curve of areas in good vessels took the form of Fig. 5—
2nd and 3rd, a curve of higher order that that of equation (1).
Captain Carlsund, of the Swedish navy, recognized this,and adopted
the form
P = b{l_^yy (Fig.5-2nd.)
for the equation of his area curve, and tabulated a series of coefficients
forthe factor in \ j-. The equation in this form is almost as easy to handle
as equation (1), but he errs on the other side; his curve produces a form
favorable to speed in large vessels, but for slower vessels, or freight
vessels of any type it is too " hollow." Nystrom, also a Swede, claims
the credit of discovering the wide range of application made possible
by the adoption of the perfectly general form.
He calculated and tabulated a large number of values of the frac-
tional factor in brackets, in itself a matter involving a great deal of
labor. The book has been out of print for years. The values of a and
of E are calculated on the same principles used for Chapman's method,


81
the only difference being in the increased complexity of the integral
factors.

For integral values of q, the area a can be almost as easily deter-
mined as by aquation (2), for all values of n. For fractional values of
q the development should be carried a little farther to insure accuracy.
In equation (5) the factor in brackets being always fractional, an
increase in value of exponent q reduces the value of ordinates near the
limit y = I much faster than in equation (1). And since (ti) is perfectly
general, we have complete control of the progression of the areas, and
can change the form at will, as illustrated by Fig. 5, retaining the same
area.
The position of center of gravity of the displacement, or center of
buoyancy, is found as before.

in which a is to found from (6).
The values for n in equation (5) may be anything up to 20. The
value of q will usually be less than 3, unless a very hollow water line is
being laid down. In displacement curves, it will range from one to
two. Two is, as has been said, the value used by Carlsund, and may be
said to give the " form of least resistance," considering wave forming
resistance alone. As is well known, however, this is the smallest part
of the actual resistance encountered by a well formed vessel in motion,
and hence a strict adherence to this value will not be advantageous.
Large vessels, moving comparatively slowly, may be filled out to a form
using q — 1, and the displacement be increased while the angle of
entrance of the displacement will not be increased. The wetted surface
will be in such a case little affected, and the result may be equal speed
and increased carrying capacity without increased expenditure of power.
Again, a vessel formed with q = 1 will have fuller ends than one


The Technic.
formed with q = 2, for the same displacement, and while she will pitch
and scend in a more marked degree, and be unable to sustain advan-
tageously such a high rate of speed, would probably not take so much
water on deck and would be classed as a dryer vessel. The sustained
sea speed is probably largely influenced by the form of the ends, as well
as by the absolute size of the vessel, which is usually considered of
more importance.
No system yet developed will settle mathematically a tithe of the
puzzling questions asked of the naval architect. The largest factors of
success in successful vessels are good judgment and experience in
design, and any search for " the form of least resistance " which does not
recognize this must come to grief. The method here spoken of requires
study and experience for its mastery, as does any other branch of
advanced science, but it offers, in the mind of the writer of these notes,
the most promising field for investigation that can be hoped for by the
student in naval architecture, to whom it is commended.

The Technic.
The several dimensions used, and their derivation and deduction,
are shown by the diagram and accompanying equations. An example
will best show the use of the table.
Given— The pitch of worm = J inch.
*Pitch diameter of worm = 1| inch.
Number teeth in worm gear —. 37.
The working dimensions needed, with reference to the teeth and
thread, are — for the worm;—
Outside diameter = pitch diam. + 2 H = 1.5 + S .1061 - 1.7122.
Core diameter = pitch diam. — 2 S = 1.5 * — 2 * .1228 = 1.2544.
Width of thread too) end = .1032.
— for the gear.
37 + 2
Outside diameter = (No. teeth + 2) -s- diam. pitch — - = 4.138"
The hob for finishing the gear teeth after they have been roughed
out is similar in appearance to the worm. It is fluted, the threads
relieved on the sides and tops and then hardened.
Being the inverse of the gear, its face depth of thread must equal
the flank depth of gear tooth, and its flank depth of thread the face
depth of gear tooth, so thai for the hob
Outside diameter = pitch diam. + 2 S = 1.5 + 2 » .1228 = 1.7456.
Core diameter - - pitch diam. — 2 H = 1.5 — 2 * .1061 - 1.2878.
Width of tool end = .1118"
If a short hub be added to the hob or worm blank and is made
equal to the core diameter, it will serve as a gauge in cutting the thread
to the proper depth.
It may be noted that although the dimensions are in decimal parts
of an inch, they may be stated, where accuracy is not required, and
especially in the case of coarse pitches, in common fractions correct to
the nearest 64th of an inch.
The gear blank may be made 1-64 in. large in diameter, and the
depth of teeth gauged by the distance apart of the arbors carrying the
gear blank and hob. Of course if the blank is the exact diameter, the
correct tooth depth is obtained when the core diameter of hob touches
the gear blank.
In the first column of the table are given the threads per inch,
which will be useful when determining the lathe change gears to cut
the proper thread on the worm.
Notes. The angle of thread 29° is generally used, although 30° is
common.
•Instead of the pitch diameter the outside diameter is often assumed, and the
other dimensions obtained from it l&gt;y the proper deductions.


85
The diameter of the worm is given by Unwin at from 3 to 4 times
the pitch, by Joshua Rose at 4 times the pitch; but so far as the writer
has observed it has been 5 or even 6 times the pitch.
The minimum number of teeth in the gear is usually put at 30; a
double, triple or quadruple threaded worm is used if a quicker ratio of
wheel to worm motion is desired.
With many less than 30 teeth it is necessary that the face of the
teeth be increased and the flank decreased even to no flank at all,
increasing the outside diameter of the gear as may be necessary to main-
tain the proper depth of tooth
The face of the gear is such that 1-6 of the circumference of th&amp;
worm is in mesh with the gear. This makes the width of gear about £
diameter of the worm.

In a machine design calling for the use of bevel gearing, the first
factor determined with reference to a pair of gears is the speed ratio
and this once determined usually remains fixed as it is not influenced
by the structural requirements.
The diameters, pitch, and length of face of teeth are, however,
affected by the duty requirements. These three factors also having
been found, the remaining—the working—dimensions are to be obtained
by means of the table.
In a pair of bevel gears, with their axes intersecting at right angles,
Let the pitch diameter of pinion = 3£ inches.
""" " "gear = 4J inches.
""diameter pitch = 10 inches.
""face of tooth — 7-8 inches.
From the above it is seen that the ratio is 7 to 9 and the number of
teeth in pinion is 35, in the gear 45. The face is not needed for the
■determination of the other dimensions.
In the table all the factors for the present problem are in a line at
the left of which is stated the proportion 7 — 9.

By referring to the diagram it is seen that in the pinion the com-
plement face angle is &lt; C — &lt; D.

The decrement angle D — '= 2.01° hence

&lt; e— &lt; D = 52.13° — 2.01° = 50.12°
The outside diameter = pitch diam. + diam. increment.
Diam. increment = = . 158 in. hence

The distance from the points of the teeth to the back of hub = the

The cutting angle K, i. e., the angle of the axis of the pinion with
the path of the gear cutter, = C — (Z&gt; + .157 D) = 35.54°. The sum of
the co-face, depth of tooth, and cutting angles = 90° and the correct-
ness of one's work may be thus proved.
50.12° + 4.34° + 35.54° - 90.00°.

the above dimensions may be approximated as follows:

Angles.—The writer has chosen to use in the chart instead of the
center angles their complements inasmuch as, on the lathes with which
he is acquainted, the graduations on the compound rests read 0° when
the slide movement is at right angles to the center line of spindle, so
that the angles are given relative to the above position of the rest and
hence are complements of those relative to the line of the spindles.

Z is the center angle of the smaller gear.
Clearance.—The clearance here used (.157 X J working depth of

duced by Brown &amp; Sharpe. A clearance of } (or }) of half the working
depth of tooth is also common. Either is correct and all within certain
limits are arbitrary.
Face.—For reasons due to the dimensions of bevel gear cutters it
has been advised that the face of a bevel gear be not more than one-
third the distance from the outside diameter to the intersection of the
gear axes. A longer faced gear to be well cut would require two cutters.
The face of a planed bevel gear may be of almost any length.

STANDARDS EMPLOYED IN ENGINE TESTING.
R. C. CARPENTER.
The following paper contains some suggestions and considerations
which have been called to my attention in working up the results
obtained in testing engines of various classes. The paper is not to be
considered in any way as a complete treatise; it is rather a collection of
suggestions, thrown together without any attempt at scientific arrange-
ment.
While standard methods of testing have been adopted by various
engineering societies, for many kinds of engineering tests, so far as the
writer knows, none have even been proposed for the steam engine.
I might add further, that in my opinion none are needed. Standard
methods are only required in such cases as those, in which results are
dependent upon the method of testing. This is the case in the testing
of materials, and to a great extent true in testing steam boilers. It is
well known, no doubt, that the strength of a given material will be
affected by the form of test specimen, rate of applying stress, and other
considerations; in the testing of steam boilers, slight differences in the
method of starting the fires, or closing the test, might make great dif-
ferences in the result. In the case of a steam engine, the condition is
very different. If the water or heat per I. H. P. per hour is desired, the
method used will have little effect on the result. A standard method is
not required; we do need to know that every operation is performed
with accuracy, and that our results, when obtained, are reliable within
a certain prescribed limit.
Since absolute accuracy cannot be obtained, the errors made should
be subject to the most careful consideration, and the effect on the
results of the probable error should in each case be considered.
The economy of the steam engine is expressed by various authori-
ties in different terms dependent upon the standard of comparison
used.
The standards of comparison employed are of considerable import-
ance, and are briefly as follows:
1. Tlie coal or fuel burned for each horse-power of work performed.
This is, and no doubt will ever be, the commercial standard of economy.
In practice it is an uncertain standard to apply, since so many condi-
tions affect the capacity of a given weight of coal to evaporate water in
the boiler. The water evaporated per pound of fuel is dependent on


91
the kind and condition of the boiler, on method of firing, character of
draught and even on the weather, so that it is an uncertain standard of
reference.
2. The weigfd of dry steam used by the engine for each horse-power
of work performed. This is the standard in principal use today, and
everything considered is as constant and reliable as any that has been
proposed. The steam, as it leaves the boiler, usually contains more or
less water, the effect of which on the engine is regarded by some engin-
eers as extremely detrimental to the economy of the engine, and by
other engineers as beneficial in proportion to the heat contained. A
series of experiments, made for the writer by Messrs. Marks and Tracy,
show that the water does not affect the economy. (See Transactions
Am. Society Mech. Engineers, 1893-4.) Similar results were obtained
in experiments by Profs. Denton and Jacobus. This would seem to indi-
cate that the weight of dry steam is a proper standard of reference, and
under usual conditions that the heat carried in by entrained water is not
available for useful work. It should be noted, however, that these
experiments have all been performed on wasteful types of engines, and
that general conclusions cannot at the present time be deduced with
certainty. The capacity of a pound of steam to perform work depends
upon the pressure, as well as the proportion of dry steam, so in every
case this important condition should be stated, since it affects the value
of the standard. t
3. The heat transformed per I. H. P., expressed in British Thermal
Units (B. T. U.). reckoned from feed water temperature taken in by the
engine for each horse-power of work performed per minute, has been
proposed as a standard, the advantage of which is its general character,
since the same unit of measurement can be applied to hot air, gas and
oil engines, or any form of heat engine. The disadvantage is that it is
a new standard expressed in terms not widely understood, and, when
applied to the steam engine, does not readily permit correction for the
heat carried in by the entrained water. The capacity for a given
amount of heat to perform work depends upon the temperature, so in
every case this condition should be mentioned.
While this standard is not likely to come into common use, yet
from its general character and scientific form, I would advise employ-
ing it. in connection with the other standards.
4. The perfect or ideal engine as a standard. Comparison of the
engine, with some type which is considered perfect,or at least the ideal
which the engine approaches, is coming into quite general use in
scientific discussions, and is no doubt the proper method of considering
the performance of an engine.
The difficulty experienced in this respect comes from a selection of


The Technic.
the proper standard. If we consider a perfect heat engine as the stan-
dard, we are forced to include in our mind, boiler, engine, condenser,
and feed pump as essential component parts. In this case, we have
heat supplied the engine by the boiler, steam is used as the medium for
conveying it, at constant temperature, a certain portion of this heat is
transformed into work in the engine; supposing no condensation or
radiation losses, the remainder is exhausted into the condenser also at
constant but lower temperature. If we suppose the absolute tempera-
ture of entering steam to be T, that of the exhaust steam to be TV the
work done is due to transformation of heat between the temperature
limits Tand 1\, that is, all the heat disappearing has been transformed
into work, and in the meantime the working substance returns to its
original condition. The heat which has been exhausted we can sup-
pose is by some mechanical means returned directly to the boiler at a
temperature 7,, thence by the heat raised to the temperature T. If the
engine is perfect, all heat that disappears is replaced by an equivalent
amount of work. Now we can readily conceive that if all this work
could be reconverted into heat, the original temperature would be
restored, and the engine would be a reversible one, corresponding to
the conception of Carnot. It can also be seen that this idea of reversi-
bility is only another standard of perfection, simply implying that all
transfer of heat is accounted for by the work performed, and vice versa,
that a reversible engine is a perfect engine. It does not follow that a
perfect heat engine is a reversible one, for it is easy to conceive of a
perfect transformation of heat into work without capacity of trans-
forming the work back into heat. Because of the uncertain character
of the boiler performance, it seems even in this case better to separate
in our consideration the engine from the boiler. The following
remarks, which I think are of practical importance, relate to the ideal
or perfect engine as independent of the boiler.
The Perfect Engine as a Standard. The relation of the ideal engine to
the real is well worth considering; even if it does not result in a satis-
factory standard, it will give us the limits of heat consumption, which
no real engine can surpass.
An engine which transforms all the heat within the limits of tem-
perature of admission and exhaust is no doubt perfect, and might serve
as a standard or model with which the actual engine working within
the same temperature limits might be compared. Such an engine,
although perfect, need not have maximum efficiency; by that of course
I do not mean that any engine working under the same conditions can
do better, but that it is possible to conceive circumstances so that for
the same temperature limits the returns will be greater than for other
cases.

Thus, for instnnoo. suppose a given amount ot heat H supplied, an
amount II' exhausted, an amount A W transformed into work, an
amount R lost.
Then it is evident that H— IV = R -f- A W, and if A' be supposed
equal to zero.

'1 he heat contained in a body is a function of the temperature, and
also of a certain capacity of the body to store heat in such a manner as
not to be sensible to the thermometer. The measure or scale of this
latter property was termed by Clausius Entropy, by Rankine Thermody-
namic Function. It was denned by both authors as being "such a quan-
tity that multiplied by the absolute temperature will give the total heat
available for work." That is, if &lt;p — entropy, T = absolute tempera-
ture. The work capacity = J j d&lt;f. Entropy seems more difficult to
comprehend than the other quantities used in a thermodynamical dis-
cussion, largely, I think, because there is no instrument which will
measure it directly. It bears about the same relation to heat that the
force of gravity does to weight. Thus the product of mass and force
of gravity gives weight, so does the product of absolute temperature
and entropy give heat.
That is IF*. = Mg or M = Wt. -+- g
So also 7/ = J'por T = W-h?.
The force of gravity varies in different positions as the earth, and
for different heights, entropy varies with different*substances and dif-
ferent conditions of the different bodies, and for different tempertures.
The ordinary indicator diagram is a pressure-volume diagram; in
which the ordinates are proportional to pressures on the piston and the
abscissae to the volumes swept through. The area of this diagram repre-
sents the work done on the piston.
In a similar way a temperature-entropy diagram can be drawn, the
area of which will also correspond to work The ordinates of this dia-
gram would be proportional to the temperature, the abscissae propor-
tional to the entropy. The vertical lines in this case would be adiaba-
tics, the horizontal lines isothermals.

Such a diagram referred to
rectangular co ordinates is repre-
sented in Fig. 1, in which ordi-
nates are temperatures and
abscissa are entropy values, the
work performed is represented
by the area abed. In this case
we have, during the passage
from a to b, work done, with
constant temperature, the en-
tropy supplied being represented
by a b; then from b to c, work
done without addition or sub-
-J» traction of heat, the temperature
np. « falling from b to c. Thence with
constant temperature we have
fall of entropy from c to d, thence constant entropy from d to a with
increase in temperature. It is noticed that in constant entropy, the only
change of heat is that due to work. That is in passing from b to c, there
is a decrease in temperature, exactly in proportion to the work done by
the working substance; in passing from d to a there is an increase in
temperature exactly proportional to the work done on the working sub-
stance. From a to b entropy increases, due to the addition of heat to
the working substance and from c to d entropy decreases due to dis-
charge of heat.
If 7'be the absolute temperature corresponding to a b, T' that cor-
responding to d c, &lt;? the entropy corresponding to the line 6 c and &lt;f' that
corresponding to the line a d. We have the area corresponding to the
work done as (T— 7£) (&lt;p — f). The total abailable heat supplied is
that included within the lines a b g h or in other words is T (&lt;? — y' l.
From which the efficiency becomes
(T — T) (y — &lt;p') _ T— T
T((p _
(1)
This efficiency would have been less, had any other hypothesis been
made, suppose for instance that the heat is not supplied at constant
temperature or in other words that change of entropy and temperature
occur simultaneously, and our diagram is a efc d instead of a b c d. It
needs no demonstration to show that the result is a decrease in area,
and consequently in efficiency, although the limits of temperature
remain the same. For the case of maximum efficiency we also have
constant entropy during change of temperature, or in other words all


95
changes of temperature are due to work which is performed either by
the working substance or upon the working substance.
I am quite well aware that adiabatic lines and isothermal lines are
usually drawn on a, pressure volume scale, in which case they are curved
lines, as shown in Fig. 2. The diagram abed has the same significance
as in Pig. 1. For this case, isoth-
ermal lines are horizontal for
steam, hyperbolic for air. Tem-
perature is the distance between
isothermals, entropy is the distance
between adiabatics measured on
isothermals.
Tables of entropy for steam are

Space will not permit further reference to this subject, save to say
that an excellent exercise which will do much to fender one familiar
with applied thermodynonics, can be found by translating an ordinary
pressure-volume diagram, as taken by an indicator, into an equivalent
temperature entropy diagram as shown in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2. An excel-
lent practical application of this can be seen in the recently published
Test of the Willans Engine, presented before the English Institution of
Civil Engineers.
The Perfect engine of the Carnot cycle is well worth serious consid-
eration, since it forms the basis on which rests all the deductions of the
system of thermodynamics.
Its method of action has already been described. It is represented
graphically in Fig. 1, and its efficiency is given by equation (1)—
'As 42.42 Thermal units are equivalent to 33,000 foot pounds.


The Technic.
The heat required per I. H. P. per minute, were the efficiency 100,
would be 42 42.
With an efficiency C = —j,— as in equation (I), the heat required
by the perfect engine for each horse-power per minute must be
JT-^^j^ (2)
The remarkable circumstance regarding the perfect engine is that
the condition of the working substance at the end of the cycle is the
same as at the beginning, and hence the entropy or heat scale can be
eliminated, making the efficiency depend purely on temperatures
through which the working substance passes, as already proved in
equation (1).
This hypothesis will require the same weight of working substance
at the end of the cycle as at the beginning and will convert the engine
into a pure heat engine, m which all the working substance is retained
and alternately heated and cooled.
Furthermore to get maximum efficiency the heat must all be added
at one constant temperature and discharged at another. These con-
ditions satisfied, we have the ideal reversible engines of Carnot, which
is not only perfect, but is of maximum efficiency.
The actual engine which approaches this ideal the most nearly, is
the air engine; in this.engine we have the same substance alternately
heated and cooled, but the temperature changes take place slowly, the
working substance being gradually heated and gradually cooled, and
moreover, radiating much heat through the cylinder walls.
The steam engine can be considered as receiving its heat at one con-
stant temperature and discharging at another constant temperature
without sensible error, but the working substance is discharged with the
heat, and it can hardly be considered as reversible, unless indeed we
consider the furnace boiler condenser and feed pump parts of the
engine, and that the working substance be brought to its original con-
dition by mechanioal work of compression.
It is a question whether the economy of a perfect heat engine can
be satisfactorily expressed in terms of weight of steam, for by the hypo-
thesis the working substance remains constant, heat only flows through
the engine; hence the heat added must be considered as supplied by
some fuel.
As the working substance is brought back to original temperature
at end of cycle, we can suppose that if it be steam, it expands and heat
is discharged leaving only water at exhaust temperature, and this by
compression is raised to the original temperature. The heat necessary
to be added in each case is equal to the latent heat of vaporization,


which is added and discharged. For this reason the equivalent weight
of steam per I. H. P. per hour is often expressed as equal to the results
in equation (5) divided by the latent heat (r).
That is the weight of steam per I. H. P. per minute U.
T. 42.42 42.42 T
U = — = — TZTT. (3)
While it is true that the latent heat is the measure of that to be
supplied, it is not certain but that more heat will be given off by a
pound of steam used as an external fuel in which case the above
expression is not true.
The heat required per I. H. P. as given in equation (2) can be ob-
tained from any source whatever; it may be supplied directly from com-
bustion of coal, gas or by contact with steam. The heat that will be
given up by any of these bodies, supposing no waste, is that included
between the limits of maximum and minimum temperature, that is
if /- represents the heat at maximum temperature and q that of the
lowest temperature, which for steam we will assume to be below the
temperature of liquefaction, we have the general formula for weight
of fuel per I. H. P. per minute.

This fuel may be carbon in which case A = 14500, or it may be steam

Hence the above is the expression for the weight of fuel or of steam
used as fuel that must be supplied per hour, to provide heat necessary
to perform one horse power, to an engine operating in the reversible
■cycle described by Carnot.
The following table computed for various pressures of steam, gives
the minimum values of heat and steam per horse power for a perfect
■engine of maximum efficiency, working under the conditions described.
It is of interest as forming a limit which the steam engine can never
reach.

STEAM ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE DIAGRAM—WATER RATE FROM THE
DIAGRAM PER I. H. P. PER HOUR.
Another standard which under certain conditions may be very use-
ful is the weight of dry steam per I. H. P. per hour, as shown by the
diagram. This is computed in much the same way as though the
engine were a meter, and a given volume of steam was measured off at
a given pressure. Because of the varying pressure, this quantity will
evidently vary for different positions of the stroke; it is evidently equal


in every case to the product of volume, density and number of strokes
made for each horse-power of work. The steam filling the clearance
spaces must be included in the volume in this computation, and from
the result must be deducted the weight of steam restored by com-
pression. This latter quantity is equal to the clearance volume,
multiplied by its density at end of compression.
Very simple formulae can be obtained for this quantity as follows:
represent length of the stroke in feet by I, area of piston in square
inches by a, the clearance in percentage of the stroke by c, the percent-
age of the stroke completed at point when water rate is to be computed
by b, number of strokes per minute by n, the weight of a cubic foot of
steam at the point when water rate is required by w, and that corre-
sponding to pressure at end of compression by w'.
We have the following equations:
Number of cubic feet of steam per stroke = I ( - c | —
V. 100 J 144
Cubic feet of steam in clearance = , _i C " .. ^
100 X 144
(«)
I c a w'
144
(8)
Total weight of steam per stroke = I (h+ c\ ^
F V. 100 J 144
= 144^0 [(6 + C) w - 0 w']
To get the total weight per hour and per horse-power, multiply the
above result by 60 n divided by the number of horse-power which is
expressed as plan -t- 33000, in which p = mean effective pressure.
Performing these operations, formula (8) will reduce to the follow-
ing form:
Water rate from diagram I D I a ^ 60n .T,, , . .1
per I. H. P. per hour, } = B = 144OO X pTa^ XL(6 + c) W ~ 0 w J
_ 137.5^(6 + c) w — c w' j (.1)
By referring to equation (8) it is noticed that is the volume
expressed in cubic feet swept through by the piston. Call this value V,
then by substitution in (8) we have
Weight of steam per stroke = C = £(&amp; + c) w — c w'J '"
It is believed that equation (9) is the simplest possible expression
Note.—In above equation b and c are percentages of the stroke, but are used as
Integers. If used as decimal numbers, Fwill not be divided by 100.

for the water rate, as shown by the diagram per I. H. P. per hour. The
values of w and w' are to be taken from steam tables, all the other
quantities from the diagram itself.
In case the compression pressure is equal to that at the point at
which the diagram water rate is wanted, w will equal w' and the effect
of clearance will disappear.
Formulae (10) for this case will become
137.5
B = — (bw) (11)
Equation (9) can be put into the following form, which is very con-
venient for tabulation:

B - — [137.5 (6 + c) w — 137.5 c w'] (12)

The method of using the tables is quite evident, but as an illus-
tration, suppose we have the following data from an engine 10 inch


101
diameter, 24 inch stroke, and required to know the steam per stroke and
per 1. H. P. per hour accounted for by the diagram, measurements from
the diagram give us;
Absolute pressure at cut off, 85 pounds; at release, 27 pounds.
Absolute pressure at end of compression, 65 pounds; clearance
known or measured, 5%; piston displacement computed 2.78 cubic
feet; cutoff from diagram measured. 25%; release, 97%: M. E. P., 42.5
pounds.
The partial products of equation (12) are found in column (2).
Since 6 = 25 c = 5, we have the following for values at cut off:
1 681.3
B = 427r&gt; t26-228 X 30 — 2U06 X 5] = = 16.1
To find the weight of steam per stroke in a similar manner, using
equation (10) and taking result from column (2), we have
2 78
6 = Too t-1908 x 30 — -1535 X 5] = .0278 X 4.958 = 0.137
At release we have the following values obtained in a similar way:
B = — (9.48 X 97 — 21.106 X 5) = ^ = 19.2.
42.o 42.5
C = [.0694 X 97 —1535 X 51 = 5.98 X .0278 = 0.167.
The following diagram gives the results and also the partial products,
in a fairly accurate manner, for the water used per I H P per hour. It
will be found very convenient to use.

Method.—Pass in horizontal direction a distance equal to absolute
pressure at point, as marked on the base line, thence vertically to inter-
section with diagonal line that corresponds to sum of percentage of
stroke and clearance, b + c; read the partial result on left hand
margin. To correct for compression, proceed similarly, using abso-
lute pressure at end of compression and per cent, of clearance c,
reading result on left hand margin. Divide the difference of the two
partial results by the mean effective pressure p. The quotient is the
result sought. For compound or triple expansion engine, reduce p to
equivalent in one cylinder, and take measurement from reduced dia-
gram. In case pressure at end of compression is equal to that at cut-off,
clearance can be considered as zero.
Formulae (9) can be made to apply to a comound or triple expansion
engine, by considering p the equivalent mean effective pressure, reduced to
some one cylinder, the other quantities remaining as before.
It is usual to refer the compound or triple expansion engine to an
equivalent engine having the dimensions of the low pressure, so no
doubt it will be found of most utility to refer all calculations to the low-
pressure cylinder. In this case w and w' will have values the same as
for the simple engine, b or c if taken in any cylinders but the low will
need to be denied by the rates.of volumes of the cylinder, p will be the
equivalent mean pressure as if the work were done in the low pressure
cylinder.
As an illustration, take an actual case from the diagrams obtained
in the recent test of the Allis Triple Expansion Engines at Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. We have the following data:

Cylinder Condensation.
The value of comparing actual results with diagram water rates I
consider very great, since by such a method we can determine the
amount of steam condensed to overcome the waste in the engine. In
other words, the percentage of steam which is accounted for by the
indicator at any given point is the quality of the steam, subject to a
correction for the amount of space occupied by the condensed steam,
which latter is so small as to be much less than the errors of observation
witli the most delicate instruments, and hence can in every case be
neglected.


105
Knowing the quality of the steam one can readily compute the heat
actually present, from point to point throughout the stroke of the
piston, and thus can readily determine the relation between the work
performed and the heat which has disappeared from the cylinder.
The steam which is condensed during admission is considered of the
greatest importance in all studies of the steam engine, and this is
readily determined by comparing the actual steam used per unit of
work with that which is shown by the indicator. Calling these quanti-
ties respectively the actual water rate and the diagram water rate. We
shall find that the difference is the cylinder condensation for the
period.
If an engine test can be conducted so as to give actual water rates
for different percentages of cut-off, the comparison made as usual will
give some very useful knowledge respecting a field in steam engineer-
ing regarding which our knowledge is not definite or certain.
In order to illustrate the method I will refer to the following test of
a simple automatic engine 12 inches diameter by 14 inch stroke, with
8.75 per cent, of clearance as tested by the writer. Engine built by J. H.
McEwen. The following are the results of the test:

The accompanying diagram shows water consumption per hour,
and per I. H. P. Also the equivalent amounts as computed from the
diagrams.
For all the diagrams the abscissa is the I. H. P. developed or the
corresponding M. E. P. Values for total water per hour are given on
the left, for water per I. H. P. per hour on the right.
The curve A B which co-ordinates total steam consumption with
indicated horse power is of great interest from the fact that it forms a
8


straight line, from 0 horse power, until the load has increased beyond
the point of maximum efficiency, after which it rapidly increases in
value.
That the consumption curve plotted in this way made a straight
line was first noted by Willans, for this reason this general rule has
been termed in England, Willans' Law. The experiments made by Wil-
lans were in each case made with a thottling governor and fixed cut-off,
so that the load in no case passed the point of best economy. With an
automatic engine the curves will be essentially as shown in the diagram,
by the line A B. The equation of the straight part of the line A B for
this engine would be y = 27 x + 380, in which y is the total water con-
sumption per hour and x the total indicated horse power. The equa-
tion holds true until the engine develops about 75 horse power or cut-
off has reached about 28% apparent or 36.7o% absolute.
By subtracting the diagram water rate at cut off from the actual,
we obtain the curve W, which is not only practically a straight line,
but it is nearly horizontal. Were it perfectly horizontal, the difference
between the diagram water rate and the actual would be a constant,
and for the engine under consideration would be about 11 5 pounds.
That is, the diagram water rate plus 11.5 pounds is equal to that which
we actually found, with slight corrections for loads at every early
cut-off.
From an examination of a number of tests, I feel quite certain that
for constant speed and constant steam pressure the condensation to
cut-off per unit of work is nearly constant, but increasing somewhat
with the number of expansions, perhaps for very early cut-off it is
decidedly curved.
A test made of a compound condensing Buckeye engine by George
H. Barrus. at the World's Fair, treated in a similar manner, gives as an
equation for water consumption*
Y = 19x + 220.
In the above case, steam pressure by gauge 120, condenser pressure
25 in., revolution 165.
The steam consumption per I. H. P. for the simple non-condensing
McEwan engine would be, within limits of economical loading,
-^- = 27 + ^°
x x
And for the Buckeye compound engine condensing
For the Buckeye engine condensing compound, the actual water
rate is equal, except for earliest cut-off, to the diagram water rate meas-

ured by the average of 4.0, 5.0, 4.9, 4.78 and 11. The cut-off in high
pressure cylinder reduced to equation in low being respectfully .084,
.075, .057 and .011. The latter quantity is largely due to an abnormal
low diagram water rate, which in turn is no doubt to be accounted for
by leakage, so should be neglected. So that the average difference is
about constant, and is equal to 5 pounds.
In a test of a Corlis engine, built at Creusot, by M. De Lafond, the
constants to be added to the diagram water rate to give the actual, are
for the simple engine 8.1, 8.1 and 7.6 respectively in three trials, for the
compound engine 4.3, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 respectively on four trials, for the
triple engine 4.4, 4.2 and 4.0 respectively on three trials.
Use of the Saturation Curve.
It is common to compare the shape of the expansion curve with an
hyperbola drawn from the same point of cut-off. The result of this
comparison can not be expressed in numerical results, for the hyperbola
does not represent any known condition of steam throughout expan-
Co.rk $*°»v 6'«8 Po^ttt aU&amp;EMaW ctigmt

s'on. It has been found, however, that in the best arranged engines
the expansion curve and the hyperbola are fairly coincident, and hence
it is a practical test of the correct form of the expansion line. It would
seem that the practical resultant of work, condensation and reevapora-
tion, was such as to gain us hyperbolic expansion nearly.


The Technic.
I wish to call your attention to a graphical method of determining
the quality of the steam at all points in the expansion curve, which if
not new altogether, has not been used to any great extent. It affords
in my opinion a ready and accunnate method of determining the effect
of heat transfer from cylinder to steam and obtaining condensation and
reevaporation for each point during expansion.
During the last year I have had all the members of the classes in
engine testing make studies of the results obtained, by comparison with
the saturation curve. For the amount of labor involved I have seen no
method which has given so much information regarding the engine.
The data needed for this work are the actual steam consumption per
I. H. P. and per stroke, and the indicator diagram. The indicator dia-
gram ab c d ef, taken should be as nearly as possible in every respect an
average of all those obtained during the test. The vacuum line OP and
clearance line OR is then drawn. From the point at the end of com-
pression a extend the compression line ax to meet the steam line be.
This can be done by drawing a hyperbola asymptotic to the axes OP
and OR without sensible error. Compute from the data obtained during
the test the weight ■ of steam used per stroke. By looking in a steam
table with pressure corresponding to the steam line, find, volume corre-
sponding to one pound of steam. Multiply this by the weight of steam
per stroke, and the result will be the volume of the dry steam received
per stroke. Lay this off to the poker scale from x. The scale volume
can easily be determined, as the length of diagram represents the vol-
~nme swept through by the piston, hence this latter quantity divided by
the length of the diagram, will give the number of cubic feet per unit of
length, which may be considered the horizontal scale of the diagram.
In the diagram above xm is the volume of dry steam used per stroke,
and xn is the volume of steam which is caught in the clearance spaces,
reduced to the game pressure.
From the point m lay off the saturation curve, corresponding to the
total weight of steam, filling the volume n x added to that actually
used. This is best done from a steam table, which in every case gives
the volume of one pound of dry steam for any given pressure. We
have simply to multiply the results by the weight corresponding to-
volume m n at pressure o n, and by the number representing the given
scale. In any event but one factor has to be introduced into the values
obtained from the steam table. This can readily be done with a slide
rule, the operation requiring less time than the description. It may
also be desirable to lay off through the point o, a saturation curve-
obtained in the same way, but with a weight of steam sufficient to rill
the volume n'a, at pressure on'; this curve we will suppose to be x a r/.
In case this latter construction is used, it really should be the first oper-


109
ation, as'it will determine x more accurately than the approximate
method described. This latter operation will give us much valuable
information regarding the form of the compression curve, but since the
actual weight of the steam caught in the clearance space is not known,
it does not give the accurate information that is obtained respecting
the expansion curve.
From these curves we have at any point, as c' in the expansion curve,
the distance n' c' corresponding to the volume of steam actually in the
cylinder, and n'm', which corresponds to the volume of an equal
weight of dry steam at the same pressure.
The ratio of n' cf to n'm' is the quality of steam at that point sub-
ject only to a correction for the volume occupied by the condensed
water in the steam. This volume is very small, and can be neglected
in every case without sensible error.
The actual error involved can be seen by the following computa-
tion. Let x equal the quality or ratio of dry steam by weight; let 1 — x
equal the ratio of water by weight; let v equal cubic feet occupied by
one pound of any steam; a equal cubic feet occupied by one pound of
water; let V equal cubic feet occupied by one pound of the mixture.
Then we shall have -
v x + a (1 — x) = V
v — a v y v J
The value of &lt;r is equal with insignificant correction to 0.016. Hence
the correction to be deducted from x, obtained as the ratio of abscissa
of diagram divided by abscissa of saturation curve would be as follows:
x = .9 subtract 0.0016.
x = .8 " .0032.
x = .7 " .0048.
x = .6 " .0064.
x = .5 " .008.
x = .4 " .0096.
As the values-of x seldom fall below .8, the correction in general
can be neglected as less than probable errors of observation and meas-
urement.
These results give the quality of steam at various points on the
expansion curve, or in other words the percentage of steam accounted
for by the indicator. The product of the actual water consumption per
I. H. P. per hour by this quantity will give the corresponding diagram
water rate. The difference between this and the actual gives the differ-
ence per I. H. P. per hour required to supply losses by condensation, etc.
We can also obtain the heat existing point by point in the cylinder.


The Technic.
Thus if x be the quality, p the internal latent heat as given in the steam
tables for a given pressure, and q the heat due to the pressure, Wthe
weight of steam per stroke, We the weight of steam is clearance. We
would have for the total heat in the steam at any point during expan-
sion
H= (W+ Wc x p + q)
and during compression
H„ = Wc(xP + q).
The total heat available after condensation would be obtafned by
using r the total latent heat, instead of p, in which case
H = (W + We) (x r + q) etc.
The heat exhausted can also be obtained approximately perhaps
within three or four per cent., possibly even more closely in the follow-
ing way: Obtain the quality as described at end of expansion, this we
will consider x'. Compute the total heat available as
H' = (W+ W„){x'r + q).
With pressure corresponding to mean back pressure we should have
H" = {x" r, + qj) as representing the heat discharged.
We can consider H' as equal to H" without much error, by sup-
posing that the work done during exhaust and the increased radiation
is equal to the re-evaporation which occurs.
From this result we obtain
( W + Wc) {x' r + q)= W {x" r, + 9l)
From which
_ (W+ Wc)(x&gt;r + g)- Wq,
Wrt
by substitution of this value in equation for R" we obtain the total dis-
charge of heat per stroke, on the supposition that the cylinder does not
cool off to any great extent. This supposition is often very much in
error. Thus in the case considered, the compentation will show a qual-
ity of exhaust of 67 per cent. The actual quality was found by the heat
transferred to a condenser to have been over 90. In other words a large
amount of heat was discharged during the time the exhaust valve was
open, without doing any work.
Referring to the diagram which is the result of a test made on a
simple throttling engine 6 inches diameter by 8 inches stroke, we note
the following facts:
Quality of admission steam .98. Quality at cut-off .60.
Wt. of steam per stroke 0.01108 lbs. Wt. per I. H. P. per hour 39.7.
Wt. of steam in clearance per stroke .000557. Per cent, clearance
12.5.


Ill
Absolute pressure at cut-off 51, at release 24.
Absolute back pressure 6 lbs.
Quality in exhaust x", .95.
The variation is well shown by the curve below the diagram. It is
interesting to note that the quality decreases from 60 at cut-off to 56.2
at .4 of stroke, then steadily increases to the end of the stroke. The
irregular form of the curve is interesting, there being two points of contra-
flexure. It may be mentioned that this is a general form of curve nearly
always found, and for this reason is of especial interest.
The saturation curve can readily, and in a similar manner, be drawn
for compound or triple expansion engines, and the heat transfer for
each cylinder computed in a manner similar to that described for the
simple engine.
Considering the outlay in time and work. I know of no method more
productive of good results than that described, in connection with the
saturation curve; for this reason it is recommended as worthy the most
careful consideration.
The limits of this paper have already transgressed those laid down
by the writer at its commencement, althongh more might be said
regarding the reduction of the resutlts obtained in testing engines. In
conclusion it might be said that although the steam engine is one of the
most simple of machines so far as its mechanism is concerned, it is on
the other hand one of the most complex when considered as a heat
engine, consequently it would seem desirable to make of each test a
comparison with some simple and well determined form of action of a
pure heat engine. It is my opinion that the expansion curve produced
by an equal weight of dry and saturated steam affords the most simple
and rational standard with which to compare the actual results.

WATER SUPPLY NOTES.
In American water works construction and operation unfortunately
the importance of econimal conveyance and use of water is often under-
estimated. As a result the per capita-consumption of water in Amer-
ican cities far exceed that of Europe, in some cases being six times as
great.
During the recent discussion of a water supply for London, Eng-
land, the commission to whom the matter was referred decided that 35
gallons per capita per day was a maximum and very liberal allowance
for all domestic and manufacturing purposes. Paris in 1870 used 30
gallons, Glasgow 40 gallons, while Berlin used only 18 gallons. In
America in 1890 Louisville used 69 gallons, Philadelphia 131 gallons and
Chicago 138 gallons. In this country the per capita consumption shows
a marked tendency to increase from year to year as the works grow
older. As an example the per capita consumption of Detroit in 1860
was 70 gallons which increased steadily till 1888 when it had reached
the enormous amount of 204 gallons per capita per day. At that time
meters were introduced and during 1892 with all manufacturing and
business places, hotels, boarding houses, etc., metered and excluded, the
per capita consumption amounted to 132 gallons. The quantity used
for business purposes was 18 gallons per capita per day, or as much as
Berlin used for all purposes. Similar experiences are reported from
other places. Attempts have been made to explain this as a result of
increased manufacturing, but that this is a false assumption seems to be
shown by the fact that in Detroit in 1876 with a population of 20,102
families the average per family assessment for all purposes was $10.22,
and in 1884 with a population of 29,422 families the per family assess-
ment was $10.21, while the per capita consumption had increased from
107 gallons in 1876 to 154 gallons in 1884, although the same system and
rate of assessing had been maintained. As it is presumable that each
new manufacturing establishment was accurately assessed it leaves this
extra consumption to be accounted for otherwise. Approaching this
question from the theoretical side it is reasonable to say that if a certain
series of manufacturing establishments are necessary to any given num-
ber of people, another series of similar manufacturing establishments
will be necessary for another equal number of people, and hence the
increase of manufacturing will not affect the per capita consumption.
The real causes of increasing consumption must be sought for else-


113
where and defective construction and the wastefulness and prodigality
of the consumer must be held responsible. Defective construction
includes the so-called " slip " of the pumps, the leakage at joints in the
mains, at gate stems and in service connections. It is evident that the
first of these never decreases as time goes by. The leakage in the joints
is very apt to increase for in the beginning when the yarn in a joint is
dry, like any fibrous substance, it prevents the water passing through,
but when it has become saturated, unless the lead is properly driven,
the joint is sure to leak. Thus at a first test a line may be apparently
right, but will be found leaking badly within a month. The wasteful-
ness of man, however, is a far more potent factor, and as new fixtures
and conveniences for the use of water are introduced this increases.
In any system the consumption of water may be separated into the
following divisions:
A the necessary domestic consumption.
B the necessary manufacturing consumption.
C the constant waste due to defective construction and varying with
the pressure and construction.
D the variable waste due to the carelessness of man and varying
with the population and the pressure.
E the waste at the engines varying with the pressure and inversely
to the quantity pumped.
jFthe season waste and consumption due to weather.
By choosing times of normal conditions as spring and fall J" may be
eliminated. We then have an equation A-\-B-\-C-\-D-\-E = Q.
By observations in Detroit during the past season it was found that
during the last quarter of 1893 B = 20 gallons per capita per day. C —
28 gallons approximately and Q — 134 gallons. If we assume the nec-
essary per capita consumption for domestic purposes as 20 gallons per
day our equation takes the form:
20 + 20 + 28 + D -f E - 134, or
D + E — 66 gallons per capita per day.
In other words the useful consumption is only about one-third the
total in the mean temperature months. This deduction is corroborated
by the observation tnat when the average hourly consumption was
1,4000,000 gallons the minimum hourly consumption was over 800,000
gallons, and the usual hourly consumption at night was about 1,000,000
gallons. During the middle hours of the night the necessary consump-
tion should be practically nil, but in our case each hour it amounts to
about two-thirds of the average hourly consumption.
As Detroit appears a fair representative of other American cities it
seems to be high time that precautions were taken to prevent this pro-
digal waste of valuable water in the future for supplies sufficient for
our cities are becoming more and more difficult to obtain each year.

The Technic.
THE LUNKEN RENEWABLE SEAT VALVE.
The ordinary globe or gate valve becomes useless when the seat is
cut or worn, and must be taken out and a new one one put in its place,
which causes great annoyance and expense in many cases. The Lunken-
heimer Co. has placed on the market a renewable seat gate valve
designed to obviate this expense.
The valve is very unique and neat in appearance, and of a construc-
tion that gives great strength. The hub or bonnet is held to the shell by
a steel clip or trap surrounding the shell, with its ends passing through
the ears of the bonnet, and secured by nuts (O). The joint is packed by
a hard lead washer, and the valve can easily and frequently be taken
apart without renewing the packing washer. The hub or bonnet is flat
and narrow, and just of sufficient size to receive within it the valve disk
when entirely raised, and has sectional or part-nut thread in it opposite
interior sides. The threaded portion (J) of the stem by engaging with these
part threads, causes the valve to be opened or closed. The disk has a
straight flat face or bearing against the renewable seat (C) and is forced
tightly against same by the self-adjusting half-ring wedge (D) secured
loosely in the valve shell. The wedging on the disk is thus applied on
wedging surfaces diametrically opposite each other; thus the wedging-
pressure is properly equalized on the entire disk and insures a tight joint
on the opposite face. The pressure of the steam or liquid on the back or
wedge side of disk also aids to make a tight closing valve. For sizes
larger than 1J inch the valves are provided with a by-pass, by means of
which the pressure is removed from the valve on opening. It makes
the valve easier to open and prevents wear. The "By-pass," shown in
Plate (A), is an auxiliary valve formed in the top of the valve disk and
operated by the stem of valve, automatically, while opening or closing
the main valve (C). Channel (N) passing through the disk, connects
the inlet or pressure side of the valve with the outlet side, and the end
of the stem (H) controls this channel, there being sufficient play in the
disk coupling to allow the complete opening of channel (N) caused by
the first one-sixth turn of the wheel in opening the valve. The renew-
able seat is an exteriorly threaded flanged ring that screws against a
face or shoulder of the flange, the opposite side of which flange
forms the seat or bearing surface for the disk to close against.
The inner periphery of the renewable seat has lugs (K) for the
engagement of the spanner end (M) of wrench Plate (B), by which
opening of the body, without disturbing the pipe connections. In Iron
means, the seat is tightened or loosened through the disk Body
Valves the renewable seat (C) screws into a second brass ring, per-
manently fastened in the Iron shell to prevent rusting fast. The ring
end (T) of wrench is used to hold and guide the removable seat into
place, so as to properly start its threads into the threads in the shell.


115-
Thus, to renew the seat in a valve proceed as follow: Take off the bon-
net (E) loosen the seat with spanner end (M) of wrench; (engaging the
lugs on interior periphery of seat, as shown in Plate (B). Then unscrew
and take out seat. Then place the new seat on the ring end (T) of the
wrench and insert into valve ("see Plates C and D), holding the wrench
in one hand (to hold and guide the new seat into place) while with the
use of a knife or pointed tool in the other hand, the seat (which is
knurled or milled on its outer edge) is turned and started into its
threads. When properly started and screwed down, the other end of
wrench (spanner end M) is applied to tighten the seat firmly. Thus in
a few minutes and with perfect ease, any person can practically make
a worn out "Lunken" Gate Valve as good as new, the cost of the renew-
able seat or a new disk being but trifling. Another important feature is
that the stem, when valve is fall open, seats itself (V against U) thus
relieving all pressure on stuffiing-box, and permitting repacking of same
under pressure. The tie-band surrounding the shell adds greatly to the
strength of the entire valve, and permits of its being taken apart easily


The Technic.
with a small wrench. The shell is so short and rigid, and the wedging
surfaces are so small, that expansion and contraction have no effect
upon the valve, and thus the disk will never wedge fast and become
inoperative, which is the case with many styles of the double seated
Gate Valves. Having but a single disk and the wedging half-ring tak-
ing the place of a second disk, as a wedging resistance, this construc-
tion overcomes the objection in double disk gate valves, where liquids
remain in the shell between the disks, and often freeze or injure the
valve. It is impossible for anything to lodge on the seat of this valve,
pecause the disk and seat have a parallel straight face, and the pres-
sure on the back of disk keeps it tightly pressed against its seat, it
actually cuts away (like the action of the blades of a pair of shears)
anything in its path. This feature, combined with the renewable seat,
commends this valve for blow-off purposes.

THE DETROIT OBSERVATORY OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN.
ASAPH HALL, JR., PH.D.
This Observatory was built about 1854 through the efforts of Presi-
dent Tappan, money for the purpose being raised in Detroit. Mr. Henry
N. Walker of Detroit was especially interested in the project and gave
funds for the purchase of a meridian circle.
The Observatory building is of the usual old-fashioned type, a cen-
tral part on the top of which is the dome for the equatorial, and east
and west wings, the meridian circle being in the east wing and the
library in the west. All the walls are of heavy masonry.
About 1853 Dr. Tappan visited Europe and consulted Encke, direc-
tor of the Berlin Observatory and Professor of Astronomy in the Uni-
versity of Berlin, with regard to the Ann Arbor Observatory. By his
advice a meridian circle was ordered of Pistor and Martins and a clock
of Tiede.
At this time Francis Briinnow was first assistant in the Berlin Obser-
vatory. Probably it was through Encke that Briinnow came, in 1854, to
the University of Michigan as the first Professor of Astronomy and


The Technic.
Director of the Observatory. I think it likely that the 12J inch Fitz
equatorial was ordered before his coming; but it was not delivered till
after he was on the ground. The object glass first made by Fitz was
rejected. The glass finally sent, said to be the best of the Fitz glasses,
is a fair one. It defines well, but reflects considerable light from the
interior surfaces.
The equatorial mounting was of the usual German form in vogue
at that period, it being necessary to climb steps to read the circles and
set them. The driving clock was too weak, and, as far as I can learn,
has never been of any use. Also, there has always existed a good deal
of trouble with the illumination of the wires. In its present condition
the equatorial is of little use.
The meridian circle furnished by Pistor and Martins is of the high
order of workmanship which these artists gave to every instrument
which left their shop. However, in some respects I would criticise it.
The telescope is not symmetrical in length with respect to the cube,
rather a disadvantage, and causing considerable excess of flexure at
the longer end. As with a number of Pistor and Martins' meridian cir-
cles, the microscopes are on the ends of arms, the arms being clamped
to metal rings which are let into the stone piers and to which are
attached the Y's which support the pivots. Although these arms seem
to be quite steady, this method of construction has been generally
abandoned, as there is danger that the arms may move.
The pivots are supported by large, rectangular shaped pieces of
brass, into which the Y's are cut, and there is about fifty pounds' weight
on the Y's. The instrument is very steady. I think it may be a good
thing to have it rest in this way on large pieces of metal which can be
firmly secured, rather than on light, thin lips, as is usually the case.
But it is not possible in the arrangement as we have it to place the Y's
■of the hanging level over the parts of the pivots which rest on the Y's
of the instrument. However, Pistor and Martins probably had this fact
in mind and took a great deal of pains with the pivots. I have made
two careful examinations of them with a spherometer calliper. Each
pivot seems round, and of the same diameter throughout, though the
pivots differ from one another slightly in diameter. The object glass
and eye end of the telescope cannot be interchanged.
When Dr. Briinnow came to the Detroit Observatory, he made it at
once a working institution. Observations of new asteroids and comets
were undertaken, and a number of the asteroids which had lately been
discovered were assigned to this Observatory to be systematically fol-
lowed. The reobservation of the Bradley stars were taken up. During
the period 1858-1862, Briinnow published the Astronomical Notices, a
journal designed especially to secure the regular publication of obser-


vations made at Ann Arbor. In 1859 tables of Victoria prepared by him
were printed by the Board of Regents of the University.
Dr. Briinnow never learned English well, and probably was not
very successful as a teacher of popular astronomy. But to the few
advanced students who came under him his instruction was of the
greatest value. He was a man of first rate ability, he had been a favor-
ite pupil of Encke, pursuing his studies and having his first experience
in Astronomy just after the great advances made by Gauss and Bessel.
He had had that thorough, elaborate, German training, which has done
so much to advance all branches of scholarship. Probably no other
student in America ever received as good instruction in Astronomy as
James Craig Watson, Briinnow's successor at Ann Arbor, received from
Briinnow.
In 1859, Briinnow gave up his chair at Ann Arbor to go to the Dud-
ley Observatory, Albany, but returned in 1860 and was re-elected to his
former position. In 1863. he again resigned, and returned to Germany.
During Briinnow's stay in Albany, Watson took charge of the Ann
Arbor Observatory as Professor of Astronomy, without the title of
Director. On his return to Ann Arbor in 1860 Watson was transferred
to the chair of Physics, but when Briinnow again resigned in 1863 he
was elected Director of the Observatory and Professor of Astronomy.
Very soon after his election Watson began the preparation of a
series of charts of stars lying near the ecliptic, probably with the idea of
looking for asteroids. This very laborious undertaking seems to have
occupied a great deal of his time for ten years. His first asteroid,
Eurynome, was discovered in 1863. In all he found twenty-two of these
bodies. The last, Clytsemnestra, was discovered in 1877, all these,
except one discovered in China in 1874, were found with the Fitz equa-
torial of the Detroit Observatory.
Watson's work on asteroids and comets may have led him to the
preparation of his Theoretical Astronomy, treating of the theory of the
orbits of asteroids and comets, and of the theory of special perturba-
tions. This is an excellent work, and has been of great usefulness to
Astronomers. It appeared in 1868, when Watson was thirty years old.
For a period of five years, beginning with 1869, Watson was asso-
ciated with Benjamin Pierce in work on the improvement of the lunar
tables. The results of these researches have not been published. Pro-
fessor Watson, took part in the eclipse expeditions to Iowa in 1869 and
to Sicily in 1870, and had'charge of the Transit of Venus party to China
in 1874. In the expedition to Sicily he was the only one to be success-
ful of the party with which he was connected, having separated himself
from the others, who had located at the foot of Mount Aetna, where the
clouds formed every day about the time of the eclipse. Hie Transit o


The Technic.
Venus party in China was very fortunate, obtaining observations of all
the contacts as well as a large number of photographs.
By Admiral Rodgers, Superintendent of the Naval Observatory,
Watson was asked to take part in the observations of the Solar eclipse
of 1878, with the understanding that he should devote himself to such
investigations as he considered most important. Watson had already
corresponded with Leverrier on the subject of an intra-Mercurial planet,
which Leverrier had suggested as an explanation for the motion of the
perihelion of Mercury shown by his investigations. Indeed, there is no
doubt now, since Leverrier's work has been revised by Professor New-
comb, that the motion of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit is a reality,
whatever may be the reason of it. Watson became strongly convinced
that an intra-Mercurial planet really existed and determined to look for
it during the 1878 eclipse. During this eclipse, he discovered as he sup-
posed two such planets. There was considerable dispute in the Astron-
omical Journals as to this discovery, the general opinion being that a
mistake had been made by reason of the rude circles employed, and
that the supposed planets were two known stars. However, Watson
never lost faith in the existence of these planets. At the Washburn
Observatory, Madison, whither he went as Director in 1879, he spent
considerable money of his own in constructing an underground obser-
vatory for observing the sun and the region near it. Before this observ-
ing cellar was finished, Professor Watson caught a severe cold in it,
bringing on a congestive chill from which he died.
Watson was a pleasant, easy speaker, and an interesting lecturer,
so that the short course in general Astronomy which, during his term as
Professor, was required of almost all students, was very popular. Wat-
son gave, too, a short course of lectures to Engineering students on sub-
jects which they would require in their work. Also, there was an
advanced course in Astronomy, extending over two years, it being
intended that students should begin it in their Senior year and remain
one year after graduation.
This advanced course, wholly, or in part, was taken by a number of
good students. They were attracted by Watson's reputation and abili-
ties, by his love for teaching those who really cared for the subject, and
by his wide knowledge. For sometime, too, advanced instruction in
astronomy could hardly be obtained anywhere else. Also, Professor
Watson was engaged in investigations for the Coast Survey and Nautical
Almanac Office, the expenses of which were paid for by those institu-
tions, so that he was able to furnish employment to a number of stu-
dents of small means, and keep them at the observatory.
At this time the Government Surveys, too, called for men in field
astronomy. A number of students went into this work. Toward the
end of Professor Watson's term at Ann Arbor money was obtained for


'i.i o- / /


a students' observatory, in order that practical instruction might be
given to those who were not necessarily going to make a specialty of
Astronomy. This small observatory was not finished till after Professor
Watson's departure.
In the fall of 1879, Mark W. Harrington succeeded Watson as Pro-
fessor of Astronomy and Director of the Observatory. Under Professor
Harrington the students' observatory planned by Watson was built, and
the more extended course of instruction in practical Astronomy, as it is
now carried on. was begun. Professor Harrington did some work with
the equatorial and meridian circle, but his researches were mostly in the
direction of meteorology. In 1884 he founded the American Meteorolog-
ical Journal, the first seven volumes of which he edited. Through his
efforts the Observatory was provided with improved meteorological
instruments. He made extensive investigations with regard to the
climatic conditions of Michigan, and, indeed, of our whole country.
Also, during Harrington's term as Professor, 1879-1891, Schaeberle, in-
structor in Astronomy, made many observations with the meridian
circle of stars for the Coast Survey and of Struve's double stars, and
observed comets with the large equatorial and the small equatorial of
the students' observatory. Campbell, who succeeded Schaeberle as
instructor, made many comet observations and computed ephemerides.
When Professor Harrington went to Washington in 1891 as Chief of
the Weather Bureau, Mr. W. J. Hussey was appointed instructor in
Astronomy and afterwards Acting Director of the Observatory. Mr.
Hussey made some observations of comets and computed ephemerides.
He was succeeded in 1892 by myself as Professor of Astronomy and
Director.
It may be proper to say a few words as to the present condition of
the Observatory. The Regents lately granted money for the purchase
of a clock, chronograph, and new micrometer for the meridian circle,
but otherwise the equipment for research work is exactly the same as
when the observatory was built, forty years ago, while astronomical
instruments have been very much improved, and spectroscopy and
astronomical photography have been developed since then. The mer-
idian circle is a fair one yet, and I have undertaken with it the deter-
mination of a long list of latitude stars, making the places differential
with respect to the Berliner Jahrbuch stars. The large equatorial is in
poor shape. We ought to have a new instrument of about the same size
with a first class glass and mounting, and an extra lens, so that it could
be used for photography. The students' observatory should have a
good theodolite for purposes of instruction in field astronomy. But
more than anything else the Observatory needs an endowment so as to
make it more of a working scientific institution, and secure the imme-
diate reduction of observations.

FRANZ FRIEDR1CH ERNST BRUNNOW.
Franz Friedrich Ernst Brunnow was born in Berlin, in 1821, being
the son of Johann Brunnow, a Privy Councillor of State. Fiom 1829 to
1839 he attended the Friedrich-Wilhelm Gymnasium, and then entered
the University of Berlin, from which he received the Doctor's degree in
1843, his thesis being entitled "De Attractione Moleculari." At the
University he attended the lectures of Encke in Astronomy and of
Dirksen, Lejeune-Dirichlet, Ohm, and Steiner in Mathematics and of
Dove in Physics. After leaving the University Brunnow took an active
part, under the direction of Encke, in the work of the Berlin Observa-
tory, contributing numerous papers to the Astronomische Nachrichten
In 1847 he was made director of the small Observatory at Bilk, near
Diisseldorf. Here his work was the observation of asteriods and comets.
At this place he wrote the memoir on De Vico's comet for which he
received the gold medal from the Amsterdam Academy of Sciences.
During this time also, he prepared his Lehrbuch der Spharischen
Aslronomie, probably the best treatise we have on the subject. It has
reached four editions, and has been translated into English, French,
Italian, Spanish, and Russian. The first edition appeared in 1851, with
a preface by Encke.
In 1851 Brunnow was called to Berlin as first assistant in the
Observatory, to succeed Galle. He remained at Berlin till 1854.
During this period his tables of Flora were published. In 1854 he
came to Ann Arbor. Brunnow's work in this country has been
spoken of under the foregoing notice of the Detroit Observatory. In
1863 he returned to Europe. In 1865 he was made Professor of Astron-
omy in the University of Dublin and Astronomer Royal for Ireland, to
succeed Sir William Rowan Hamilton at the Dunsink Observatory.
Hamilton's researches had been theoretical, so that it fell to Brunnow
to reorganize the Dunsink Observatory, and start it again in the direction
of observation.
He obtained an equatorial mounting for the objective which had
been presented by Sir James South, and began active observations with
this instrument. These observations are published in the Astronomical
Observations and Researches made at Dunnink. They are models of accu-
racy and elegance, the determinations of stellar parallax being espec-
ially well known. In 1874 Brunnow's eye-sight began to fail and he
resigned his position at Dunsink, going first to Basle, then to Vevey, and
finally to Heidelburg. He was no longer able to engage to any extent
in scientific work, but as he was very fond of music, "gave most of his
time to it. He died in 1891, in Heidelburg. In 1857 Brunnow married
Rebecca Lloyd Tappan, daughter of Reverend Henry Philip Tappan.
Their only son, Rudolf Ernst, is a student of Oriental Languages.

JAMES CRAIG WATSON.
James Craig Watson was born in Fingal, County of Elgin, Canada
West, in 1838, being the son of William Watson, farmer, and. Rebecca
Bacon. William Watson had some education and a taste for learning,
but was easy going and shiftless. His wife was a woman of great
energy and natural ability. They did poorly on their farm in Canada
and when James was twelve years old, moved to Michigan, and finally
settled in Ann Arbar, probably with the idea that they sometime might
be able to send their children to the State University. In Ann Arbor
the father found work in a factory, and James had employment about
the samo place. When he was fifteen James entered the State Univer-
sity. He had had but little opportunity for instruction but had already
shown extraordinary powers as a scholar in both mathematics and
languages. Also, he was possessed of good mechanical ability, and,
boy as he was, had run the engine in the factory where he was em-
ployed.
In the University young Watson was an excellent scholar in all
directions. Brunnow recognized his great ability and promise and
helped him very much. Probably it was through him that Watson went
into Astronomy. In his Junior year Watson began work in the Observ-
atory. Before graduating he ground a four inch objective and mounted
it. In 1857 he was graduated and very soon was employed as an assistant
in the Observatory. Gould's Astronomical Journal contains an article by
Watson dated April 20, 1857, and from that time on we find many
papers by him in the Astronomical Journal, the Astronomical Notices, the
American Journal of Science, and the Astronomische Naehrichten. Many of
the communications contained observations of comets and minor
planets, with computations of orbits and special perturbations.
Watson was made Professor of Astronomy in the University of
Michigan when Brunnow went to Albany, was transferred to Physics
when he returned in 1860, and when Brunnow again resigned in 1863,
was elected Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Observatory.
The Ann Arbor position he retained till he went to the Washburn
Observatory, Madison, as Director, in 1879. He died at Madison in 1880.
Professor Watson married in 1860 Annette Waite of Dexter, Michigan.
They had no children.
Watson was engaged in a number of business enterprises and
acquired some means, a large part of which was left to the National
Academy of Sciences for the preparation of tables of the asteriods
found by him and for other astronomical investigations. He had con-
siderable influence over business men, and this influence was used for
very great good in modifying the insurance laws that were being framed
for this State.

MARK WALROD HARRINGTON.
Mark Walrod Harrington was born in 1848 at Sycamore, Illinois, his
father being of old New England stock, and his mother belonging to the
New York Walradt family, originally from Holland. He was educated
at Bvanston and at Ann Arbor, graduating as A.B. from the University
of Michigan in 1868. Soon after graduation he entered the Museum of
the University as Assistant Curator. In 1870 he was made instructor in
French and Mathematics, besides attending to his duties in the Museum.
In 1871 he went to Alaska as Astronomical Aid in the U. S. Coast Survey
reconnaissance, conducted by W. H. Dall. He returned to the Univer-
sity of Michigan in 1872, and was made instructor in Geology, Zoology
and Botany. The next year he was appointed Assistant Professor of
the same subjects. In 1876 he was granted leave of absence for two
years and went to Leipzig to study.
In 1877 he was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Mathematics
in the Cadet School of the Chinese Foreign Office. In 1879 he was made
Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Observatory at Ann Arbor,
succeeding Watson. In 1891 he was made Chief of the Weather Bureau,
after Congress had resolved to place it under a scientific head.
Professor Harrington has travelled extensively and his studies have
taken a wide range, embracing Botany, Astronomy, Mathematics, Geo-
graphy and Meteorology. He is an honorary member of many learned
bodies, and was President of the World's Congress of Meteorologists at
Chicago in 1893.
JOHN MARTIN SCHAEBERLE.
John Martin Schaeberle was born in Germany in 1853, and with his
parents, came to Ann Arbor in 1854. When he was fifteen he went to
Chicago and served a three years apprenticeship in a machine shopi
receiving a thorough training in the trade. While in Chicago he became
interested in Astronomy, and studied what books he could obtain on
that subject. Returning then to Ann Arbor he entered the High School
to fit himself for the University of Michigan. During his High School
course he made a small telescope. Entering the University in 1872
Schaeberle was graduated in 1876 as C.E.
Immediately after graduating he became Professor Watson's private


17
assistant, being employed chiefly to compute for the Berliner Jahrbuch
ephemerides and perturbations of the Watson asteroids. In 1878 he
was appointed by the Regents Assistant in the Observatory. About 1878
Schaeberle began with the Ann Arbor meridian circle observations of a
list of stars for the U. S. Coast Survey. Later the Struve double stars
were taken up. Besides the meridian circle work he made many comet
observations, and computed comet ephemerides. Also, he discovered
two new comets, one with a telescope which he had made himself just
after graduating from the University. During the twelve years of his
connection with the Ann Arbor Observatory he gave instruction in the
University and conducted much of the work in practical Astronomy.
In 1888 Schaeberle went to the Lick Observatory as Astronomer.
His work there has been of a rather varied character. For some time he
observed with the Repsold meridian circle. He took part in the eclipse
expeditions sent out by the Lick Observatory in 1889 and 1893 to North-
ern California, Cayenne and Chile, and in this connection obtained
Tesults with regard to the Sun's corona which may lead to important
discoveries. He made drawings of Mars during the oppositions of 1892
and 1894, and has made photographic investigations, publishing a paper
on "Terrestial Absorption of Photographic Rays." He has communi-
cated many papers to Astronomical Journals, some of them containing
very ingenious methods for determining instrumental constants.
WILLIAM WALLACE CAMPBELL.
William Wallace Campbell was born in Hancock Co., Ohio, in 1862.
He lived on a farm till he was fourteen. He entered the University of
Michigan in 1882 and was graduated in 1886 as B.S. (C.E.) His principal
work was with Professors Greene and Beman, and Mr. Schaeberle.
From 1886-88 he was Professor of Mathematics in the State University
of Colorado. From 1888-91 he was instructor in Astronomy in the Uni-
versity of Michigan. His principal work at the University of Michigan
was teaching, but he also observed many comets and computed ephe-
merides.
In 1891 Mr. Campbell went to the Lick Observatory as Astronomer,
having charge of spectroscopic observations. His principal work has
been on Nova Aurigae, Nebulx, Wolf-Raget Stars, various bright line stars,
comets and Mars.
Mr. Campbell has contributed many articles to the Astronomical
Journal and the Astronomische Nachrichten, and is known throughout the
world as an original investigator in the new astronomy.

His late observations on the atmosphere of Mars, which go to show
that Mars has not more than one-fourth as much atmosphere as the
earth, have attracted much attention.

THE IMPULSE WHEEL AS A STEAM TURBINE.
FRANK C. WAGNBR, A.M., B. S.
It is intended in what follows to discuss from a theoretical stand-
point the possibilities of the use of the impulse wheel as a steam engine
and to compare the results obtained with what has already been,
accomplished in the use of steam turbines of this type.
In the impulse wheel used as a water motor the pressure acts to
give the water a.high velocity, the potential energy due to the pressure,,
or head, being converted into the kinetic energy of the moving water.
The kinetic energy is then transmitted to the buckets or paddles of the
wheel. Knowing the pressure or available head, it is an easy matter to-
calculate the velocity which the water will acquire. The maximum
possible efficiency of the wheel is found by the use of Rankine's
formula:
Efficiency =1 — k = liii^ c°s^ ^ where u is the velocity of
the buckets, v, the velocity of the jet of water as it strikes the vane,
and a is the angle which the direction of motion of the bucket makes
with the jet.
De Laval's steam turbine, which attracted so much attention at the
Columbian Exposition, is a good example of the impulse wheel used as
a steam turbine. The makers publish a test, made upon a 50 horse-
power machine by Prof. Cederblom, in which the following results were
obtained.
The steam pressure was 8.6 kilograms per square centimeter, equal
to 122.3 pounds per square inch above' the atmosphere, or 137 pounds
per square inch, absolute. The back pressure wag 0.12 kilograms per
square centimeter, or 1.7 pounds per square inch, absolute. The brake
horse-power was 63.7. The total feed water for an eight hour run was
4561 kilograms or 10,055 pounds. Hence the steam consumption per
brake horse-power per hour was 19.7 pounds.
The maximum possible efficiency of any heat engine working under
the above conditions is given by the second Law of Thermodynamics as
follows: The temperature of saturated steam at 137 pounds absolute
pressure is 351 degrees Fahr., or 812 degrees absolute. The temperature-


19
of saturated steam at 1.7 pounds per square inch absolute is 120 degrees
Fahr., or 581 degrees absolute. The efficiency of a perfect heat engine
g22 581
working between these temperatures is —— = 28.4 per cent.
In the de Laval turbine the steam expands in the nozzle and the
work done appears in the form of kinetic energy due to the velocity of
the,steam jet. The highest possible velocity of the steam jet will occur
when the expansion is complete down to the pressure which exists in
the exhaust pipe. The expansion may be assumed to be adiabatic
The specific volume of saturated steam at 137 pounds absolute pressure
is 3.277. If the steam delivered to the turbine be dry saturated steam
V
and the approximate formula for adiabatic expansion, p1 vt = p21'2 &gt;
be used, then the volume of one pound of the fluid at the end of the
expansion will be found to be 170.2. The work done per pound of
steam in complete adiabatic expansion is given by the formula U = px vt
(10 — 9r~^)ps v2. [See Wood's Thermodynamics, equation (177)]. pt —
137 X 144 = 19,728; p3 = 1.7 X 144 = 244.8; ^ = 3.277; v2 - 170.2; r -
~ = = 51.94. With these values substituted, the value of Tj becomee
229,660 foot-pounds.
The heat required to make one pound of saturated steam at 137
pounds per square inch absolute, from feed water at 120 degrees Fahr.
equals 1189 — 120 + 32 = 1101 heat units = 856, 578 foot-pounds.
As the steam expands adiabatically a portion of the steam is con-
densed. At the end of the expansion the proportion of the total fluid
which is steam, is given by the formula, [See Wood's Thermodynamics
f , T, , htl\ T2 f 812 . 866.4V81 -a,
page 185]: x = [c log, J + ^ j £ = loffe _ + _ j __ = .,91.
The heat required to make one pound of steam at 120 degrees Fahr.
from feed-water at 120 degrees is 1030.4 heat units. The heat in the
fluid at the end of the expansion above water at 120 degrees, is then
1030.4 X .791 = 815.4 heat units equal to 634,409 foot pounds.
The difference between the heat in one pound of saturated steam at
137 pounds pressure and that remaining in one pound of the fluid at the
end of the expansion represents the heat which is transformed into the
kinetic energy of the steam jet, i. e. 856,578 — 634,409 = 222,169 foot-
pounds. This is the same quantity which was found to be 229,660 by
the use of the approximate law for adiabatic expansion, p1 u, = pt vt
To find the velocity of the steam as it strikes the wheel, the follow-
ing formula will serve. [See Wood's Thermodynamics, equation (62)]:

Let y equal V as before; pl = 19,728:p.t = 244.8; w, =
By substituting these values the velocity, V, is found to be 3,846 feet per
second. The kinetic energy of one pound of steam having this velo-

found for complete adiabatic expansion when y = y.
The total amount of heat given to one pound of steam has been
found to be 856,578 foot-pounds. The efficiency of complete adiabatic
expansion, and also of the nozzle of the turbine, is, then, 229,660 --=- 856,578
= 26.8 per cent.
The next step is to determine the efficiency of the turbine wheel
itself. The buckets of the wheel are so shaped that the steam acts by
reaction as well as by direct action. Unfortunately the exact speed of
the buckets during the test above quoted is not given, but the linear
velocity of the buckets in another wheel of smaller size is given as 574
feet per second. If it be assumed that the velocity of the buckets was
the same in the test quoted, sufficient data are at hand for calculating the
efficiency of the buckets. According to Eankine, the efficiency = 1 —
k = 4 " fa col^Zlifl. „ = 574; = 3846; cos a = .94. Whence the effi-
vi
4 X 574 (3846 X .94 — 574) „
C1ency = 1 - k = ^^3846 ~= 4'~ per Cent'
The total efficiency of the steam turbine will then be the product of
the efficiency of the nozzle by the efficiency of the buckets, or .268 x
.472 = .126 or 12.6 per cent.
By actual test the steam consumption was found to be 19.7 lbs.
per hour per brake horse power. The corresponding efficiency is
1980000
197X 8567578 = 117 PerC6nt
If the theoretical indicated efficiency be taken as 12.6 per cent.,
and the actual brake efficiency is 11.7 per cent., the friction of the
mechanism is-^^^g --1-= 7.1 per cent., a value altogether probable.
While of course no reliance is to be placed on this result as determining
the friction, the fact that the value obtained is a reasonable one con-
firms the legitimacy of the theoretical calculation.


21
The efficiency of the steam turbine referred to in the foregoing dis-
cussion is about that of a compound condensing engine. A triple
expansion engine working under the same conditions of boiler and
exhaust pressures would undoubtedly give a much higher efficiency.
The condition which limits the efficiency of the steam turbine is the
velocity of the buckets. If a velocity for the buckets of 1800 feet per
second could be obtained, the efficiency of the buckets in the above
ia u , 7 4 X 1800 (3846 X .94 — 1800) ao „ . .
case would be 1 — h = • = 88.3 per cent., and
oo4b X oo4o
the total indicated efficiency would become .268 X .883 = .236 or 23.6 per
cent., a result exceeding anything ever obtained in the best triple or
quadruple expansion engines. It seems probable however that 574 feet
per second is about the limit of safety with known materials of con-
struction. The conditions of high initial pressure and low back pressure,
which are favorable to a high efficiency in the ordinary steam engine,
are not so favorable in the steam turbine. A great difference of press-
ure, while it increases the efficiency of the steam jet, diminishes the
efficiency of the buckets.
By the use of the method described it would be possible to calculate
the probable efficiency of the impulse wheel as a steam turbine under
different conditions of initial and exhaust pressure. While the steam
impulse wheel cannot compete with multiple expansion engines in point
of economy it may nevertheless prove a formidable rival of the high
speed engine for small powers and under circumstances where simpli-
city and compactness are important considerations.

PHOTO-TOPOGRAPHY.
D. B. LUTEN, B.S., '94.
The use of the camera in topographical surveying, while not by any
means a new application, is not very generally understood. To show
the method, its advantages and limitations, is the object of this paper.
For surveying purposes, the camera should be mounted on a ver-
tical spindle, the axis of rotation being parallel to the plane of the sen-
sitive plate. Levelling screws and bubble are required for placing the
spindle in a vertical position. The positions of objects upon the nega-
tive are best referred to horizontal and vertical lines drawn through the
center of the picture. These lines may be photographed upon the
negative by providing the camera with a vertical and a horizontal cross-
hair of platinum wire, placed just in front of the plate, and as closely
as practicable thereto, having their point of intersection on the perpen-
dicular from the center of the lens to the plate. Means should also be
provided for measuring the distance from the center of the lens to the
sensitive plate for any focus. The camera thus mounted is really a
dumpy level and the adjustments for bubble and cross-hairs are the
same as for that instrument.
Angles of azimuth or elevation may be measured with the camera.
Having photographed any object, the horizontal distance of the picture
of the object from the vertical cross-hair, divided by the distance of the
center of the lens from the sensitive plate is the tangent of the horizon-
tal angle between the line of sight of the camera and the direction line
of the object. The distance of the picture of the object from the hori-
zontal cross-hair, divided by the distance of the center of the lens to the
picture of the object is the tangent of the angle of elevation measured
from the horizontal plane of the lens.
If then, with the camera placed at one end of a base line, a photo-
graph be taken so as to include a Hag-pole placed at the other end, the
position of the line of sight of the camera with reference to this base
line may be plotted by measurements taken from the negative; and the
horizontal angles of all objects included in the photograph may then be
plotted from the line of sight. With the camera at the other end of the
base line, the same field may be photographed again, and the horizontal
angles plotted from that point. The intersections of the pairs of direc-
tion lines give the relative positions in plan of the objects. The posi-


23
tions of the objects in elevation may be found by proportions. The
horizontal distance of the object from the camera can be measured upon
the plan; the elevation of the object from the plane of the camera is to
this horizontal distance as the distance of the picture of the object from
the horizontal cross-hair is to the distance of the picture of the object
from the center of the lens.
In applying this method, the field work of course requires a knowl-
edge of photography. But the handling of the camera and developing
of the negatives is so simple a process, that one can easily learn it suffi-
ciently well for surveying purposes in a couple of hours. The neces-
sary instructions will be found in any of the hand-books for amateurs,
accompanying cameras. Having established the base-line, the camera
may then be leveled over any point whose position with reference to
that base-line is known, and photographs taken of the section to be
mapped. Each photograph taken must include some known point
from which the position of the line of sight of the camera may be plot-
ted. In taking successive photographs from the same point, the above
condition is fulfilled by overlapping the views so that the picture of
some sharply defined object shall appear on each of two consecutive
negatives. Every object that is to be plotted upon the map must be
photographed from at least two points of view so chosen that the angle
between the direction lines of that object will not be too acute to admit
of an accurate determination of the point of intersection. The height
of instrument and the focal length of the camera should be noted for
each photograph taken. After the negatives have been developed, a
description of the point at which each negative was taken may be
scratched upon a corner of the negative. For instance, the first nega-
tive taken at stake A may be labeled Av The height of instrument and
focal length may also be transferred from the notes to each negative,
and the negatives will then contain all the data necessary for com-
pletely mapping the section.
The views taken from the extremities of the base line furnish the
basis for determining the position of other points of view; an explana-
tion of the method of orienting the first view will apply to all others.
The base-line is plotted to the desired scale, and with one end as center
a circle is drawn, having a radius equal to the focal length of the first
view taken at that point. At the intersection of the base-line and the
circle, a tangent is drawn; and on this tangent is laid off the horizontal
distance of the picture of the flag-pole at the other end of the base-line,
from the vertical cross-hair. The line joining that point on the tangent
to the center of the circle is the position of the line of sight of camera
for that view. A tangent to the circle, perpendicular to the line of
sight is the position of the negative. The direction of any object in the
picture, from this point of view, may now be plotted by laying off on


The Technic.
this tangent from the point of tangency, the horizontal distance of the
picture of the object from the vertical cross-hair, and drawing a line
through this point and the center of the circle. For determining the
positions of points of view, the measurements on the negatives should
be made very carefully with compasses. But for most topographic
work, the prominent features may be plotted by placing+he negative in
a vertical position on the drawing, so that its horizontal trace coincides
with the tangent and its vertical cross-hair pierces the plan at the point
of tangency. Then by means of a triangle, the horizontal distances of
all points from the vertical cross-hair may be projected upon the tan-
gent. It may be necessary to wedge up one end of the negative in
order to bring the vertical cross-hair into the perpendicular to the draw-
ing-board. The direction lines from any point of view should be num-
bered, as soon as determined, to correspond to the objects on the nega-
tive. Having plotted the point common to both the first and second
views, the second negative may be located from that point, and so on.
The same process applied to all the other points of view will give at
least two direction lines for each object, and their intersections give the
plan of the section to be mapped.
The elevation of any object is found by laying off on the tangent
from the point of tangency, the perpendicular distance of the picture
of the object from the horizontal cross-hair, and joining by a right line
to the center of the circle; a perpendicular is then drawn from the
position in plan of the object to the line of sight for that negative. The
intercept on this perpendicular between the line of sight and the first
line drawn is the vertical distance of the point from the level plane of
the camera measured by the same scale as the base-line. Having scaled
this distance the elevation of the object with reference to the datum
plane is readily determined, and may be pencilled upon the plan prep-
aratory to drawing in the contour lines.
Photo-topography, unfortunately, is not applicable to all kinds of
landscape; as an example, suppose a section of an orchard to be photo-
graphed from two points of view; it is almost impossible to identify any
given tree upon both negatives; or, if a meadow is to be mapped, it is
impossible to recognize any prominent features upon the different nega-
tives, and it is necessary to set flag-poles or stakes at all changes of level
before photographing; but in rough, mountainous country, or in any
landscape that has prominent features easily recognized from various
points of view, the photographic method is of peculiar value, because of
the short time required in the field-work. In fact it is no exaggeration
to say, that, for a suitable landscape, the photographic method does not
require on the field-work one-tenth of the time that is necessary for
stadia or triangulation methods; the office-work of plotting requires
about the same time as by triangulation.


25
Measurements on the negative may be made with compasses, with
an accuracy of five one-thousandths inches. In a camera of focal
length equal to ten inches, a length of five one-thousandths inches sub-
tends an angle at the lens of two minutes. Such a camera may then be
considered as accurate as a transit of least reading equal to two minutes.
But by measuring distances on the negative with a micrometer the
camera method may become sufficiently accurate for the reading of
angles to ten seconds. But, in such cases the focal length must be
measured with corresponding accuracy.
An interesting article on the application of Photo-topography to the
mapping of the mountainous country of Alaska may be found in the
Proceedings of Ontario Land Surveyors for 1894.
CHICAGO DRAINAGE CHANNEL.
ALEX. E. KASTL, B.S., '85.
Description of the Work and Methods of Construction on Sections O, M
and L of the Main Drainage Channel of the Sanitary District of
Chicago.
Sections O, N, M and L are the first four sections at the Chicago end
of the main drainage channel of the Sanitary District of Chicago, which is
now under construction. This part of the channel extends from the inter-
section of Robey Street and the West Fork of the West Branch of the Chi-
cago River, southwestward for a distance of 3.52 miles, in the City of Chi-
cago. The center line is approximately the center line of the right-of-way
which is about 800 feet wide and which is bounded on the north by a line
about 1,100 feet northward from and parallel to the north reserve line of
the Illinois and Michigan Canal; the south boundary line is, in general,
the north right-of-way line of the Santa Fe R. R. The center line is a
tangent throughout the four sections. So far as known the entire prism
of this part of the channel is in earth, mostly a hard, compact clay. The
cross-section is 110 feet wide at the bottom with side slopes of two hori-
zontal to one vertical. The center line as laid out is intended for the cen-
ter line of the channel of 600,000 cubic feet per minute capacity. The
channel which is now being excavated is of 300,000 cubic feet per minute
capacity. On the north, the side of the channel at grade is 18.37 feet to

the right of the center line and on the south, 91.63 feet to the left of the
center line. At Robey Street the elevation of the grade of the bottom of
the channel is —24.45 feet Chicago City Datum* and then slopes at the rate of
40 000' ^e °U* °' ^e c'lanne^ var'es from about 30 feet at Robey Street
to about 38 feet at the end of Section L.
At the east or Robey Street end, the channel for a distance of about
280 feet widens out northward and continues full depth to the center
thread of the West Fork of the South Branch of the Chicago River. This
end is called the Basin. Its axis makes an angle of 68° 21', east to north,
with the center line of the channel, and its bottom width is about 260 feet.
This makes an ample connection with the present navigable waterways of
the city.
Section O.
Section O extends from the center line of Robey Street, Station 38 +
89.7, to the south line of the right-of-way of the Chicago, Madison and
Northern R. R. Co., Station 109 + 11.7.
The contract was let to firms comprising the Illinois Dredging Com-
pany and Hayes Brothers on May 2nd, 1894.
The excavation is to be mainly done by steam dipper dredges, the
excavated material being loaded into dump scows, towed out into Lake
Michigan and dumped there. By the terms of the contract no excavated
material is to be disposed of on the right-of-way, except as required by the
■ Chief Engineer. Such material as is not needed by the Sanitary District
becomes the property of the contractor and he disposes of it outside of the
right-of-way of the Sanitary District as he sees fit.
The total amount of material to be excavated is 1,504,736 cubic yards.
On the 1st of January, 1895, about 517,000 cubic yards had been excavated.
Of this amount 108,200 cubic yards have been excavated by dry methods
.and 408,800 cubic yards by steam dipper dredges. The dry methods in use
are: loosening the material with plows and removing the same with wheel
scrapers, dump cars drawn by horses, and railroad cars. The steam dipper
dredges are of the ordinary type as seen in and about Chicago. Almost all
the dredging plant has been in use in this vicinity for a number of years.
There is nothing particularly novel in this method of doing the work. Up
to the present time the dredging work has been entirely confined to that
part of the channel between the center line of Robey Street and the east
line of Western Avenue Boulevard—a distance of a half mile. In this

The largest number of dredges employed at any one time was five, but
four were worked steadily all the season, which extended from May 15th

In considering the above data it is well to call attention to the fact
that during all the season the dredges were worked at close quarters and
therefore could not be worked to the best advantage. This was due to the
lack of right-of-way, the dredges not being able to proceed west of West-
ern Avenue Boulevard. Part of the time it became necessary for one
dredge to cut a channel ahead, casting the material on either side, in
order to make room for the other dredges. Thus some of the material was
handled twice. This would have been avoided had there been more
ground to work over.
The following shows the largest day's work done by each dredge:
Dredge No. 3 loaded 8 scows in ten hours, or about 1,400 cubic yards.

The following shows the largest week's work done by each dredge:
Dredge No. 3 loaded 36 scows in 6 ten-hour shifts, or about 6,600 cubic
yards, being an average output per 10 hours of 1,100 cubic yards.
Dredge No. 6 loaded 40 scows in 12 ten-hour shifts—night and day
work—or about 9,200 cubic yards, being an average output per 10 hours of
770 cubic yards. Time was lost waiting for scows.
Dredge No. 9 loaded 48 scows in 6 ten-hour shifts, or about 9,200 cubic
yards, being an average output per 10 hours of 1,530 cubic yards.
Dredge No. 13 loaded 28 scows in 6 ten-hour shifts, or about 5,350
cubic yards, being an average output per 10 hours of 890 cubic yards.
Sections M and L.
The contract for Sections M and L was let to the Heidenreich Com-
pany on December 27th, 1893.
These sections extend from the west right-of-way line of the 26th
Street Branch of the Santa F6 R. R. to the east right-of-way line of the
Chicago and Western Indiana Belt R. R.—from station 154 + 22.8 to sta-
tion 224 + 96.8. They are not crossed by any railroad lines nor by any
public highways. The original surface was almost a perfectly flat prairiei
the west end of Section L being about one foot higher than the east end of
Section M. This topographical feature enabled the contractors to use the
plant, to be described later on, under the most favorable conditions.
The sections are worked together, the plant as designed passing back
and forth over both sections.
The total amount of material to be excavated is 1,811,731 cubic yards
(Section M, 717,650 cubic yards and Section L, 1,094,081 cubic yards). On
December 24th, 1894, about 801,870 cubic yards had been excavated, leaving
1,009,861 cubic yards to be excavated.
Of the amount thus far excavated about 178,387 cubic yards were
taken out with wheel scrapers, dump cars and New Era graders, and the


The Technic.
balance, 623,483 cubic yards, was taken out with steam shovels in connec-
tion with inclined conveyors.
The team work was undertaken more to keep up the contract require-
ments as to monthly progress than for any other reason. As soon as the
excavating plant was fairly installed, the team work was stopped.
Each of the inclined conveyors, which will be more particularly
described later on, consists of a temporary wooden trestle approach leading
at right angles from the slope of the channel cut to an inclined wooden or
steel truss structure called the "incline," together with the necessary
tracks, cable hoisting machinery and dump cars. Three of the inclines
are built of wood and one of steel. One inclined conveyor is used in con-
nection with each steam shovel.
Pour (4) steam shovels are now in use. Each shovel travels on a path
parallel to the center line, making a longitudinal cut. It loads the mate-

rial mto two cars, one at a time, which are drawn by cable hoisting machin-
ery up the trestle approach and incline and automatically dumped from
the apex of the incline. The incline and its approach move alongside the


31
channel at the same rate as the steam shovel, and the excavated material
is dumped in a ridge parallel to the channel. When the plant reaches the
end of the work, the steam shovel is turned around, the approach short-
ened and the incline moved toward the channel. Then another cut is
made in the reverse direction. When two plants meet, the steam shovels
pass each other and exchange conveyors. The height of the finished spoil
bank will be about 30 feet. An 80-foot berm is left on each side of the
channel. t
Description of Inclined Conveyor.—The incline is about 80 feet long
over all, its base about 46 feet long, its height about 34 feet and its width
16 feet. The upper chords on which rests the dump car track system are
about 80 feet long. The apex of the incline overhangs about 26 feet and
the end of the car tipple about 8 feet farther. The side elevation looks
like an obtuse angled isosceles triangle resting on one of the equal sides,
the obtuse angle being about 130°.
The incline is mounted on two 8-wheel trucks which travel on two
temporary railroad tracks of 3-foot gauge and 32 feet between centers.
These railroad tracks are parallel to the channel. The truck nearest the
channel side is lengthened out sufficiently so as to carry the boiler room
which is adjacent to the incline. Part of the space in the interior of the
incline nearest the channel is enclosed and contains the cable hoisting
machinery.
The approach from the channel side is made on a temporary timber
trestle. This trestle connects with the incline at a point about 10 feet
above the ground and descends uniformly to the edge of the slope, then
breaks grade and continues down the sloping sides to the steam shovel.
The base of each bent of the trestle is a 6" X 6" timber, rounded upward
at each end so as to serve as a runner.
The incline is moved ahead by a shaft geared to the car wheels and
hoisting engine; or by means of blocks and tackle, power being furnished
by the hoisting engine. The trestle approach is moved ahead with the
incline by a system of light wire cables running to a capstan turned by
horse-power. The approach is prevented from settling unevenly by being
run across lines of planking laid at intervals. The bottoms of the runners
are greased to reduce the friction.
The incline and its approach carry a standard gauge double track, 10
feet between centers. Two cars, each 9 feet long, 8 feet wide and 2 feet
deep are used. The front or upper end of each car is open. The cars are
rated at 5 cubic yards.
The hoisting engine is a Mundy double-drum of 75 I. H. P. The hoist-
ing drums are 48 inches in diameter. Three-fourths or seven-eights inch
wire hoisting cables are used. Each cable passes from its drum, under-


The Technic.
neath the incline, to a pulley at the end of the car tipple and then down
the track to the car.
Method of Working.—The method of working is as follows: One of the
cars is put in position so that the steam shovel can load it. As soon as it
is loaded it is drawn up the trestle approach and the incline. On reaching
the apex of the incline, where a short section of the track is pivoted on a
horizontal axis, the weight of the loaded car and the tension of the cable
cause the forward end of this section of track or tipple, as it is called, to
drop down and the excavated material slides out of the car. As soon as
the car is empty and the tension on the cable released, the tipple is
brought back into its normal position by counter balances and the car is
again let down into the cut. In the meantime the other car has been
loaded and is being hoisted. Generally the empty car is returned to the
channel side before the other car is fully loaded. Thus the cars are loaded
and dumped alternately and the shovel loses no time. When the shovel
has to be moved ahead, the incline and its approach are moved ahead at
the same time. The incline and its approach can be moved into a new
position sooner than the steam shovel and the latter can resume opera-
tions as soon as it is in position.
The tipple is provided with a system of hooks and catches which hold
the car and prevent it from falling off when it dumps.
When a car is loaded the engine-man is signaled to hoist the car.
When the car nearly reaches the top of the incline, it strikes a lever which
operates an audible signal in the engine room, thus informing the engine-
man when to slow up and stop the engine. In the engine room is also a
visible signal which shows him when the tipple has come back into posi-
tion after dumping the car. He then releases his brake and the car des-
cends. The descent of the car is controlled by the signal-man at the
channel side, who is able to stop it at any point on the incline or on the
approach. This is done by a band brake on the hoisting drum, which is
operated by the signal-man. In other words, each drum has two brakes,
one of which by a system of rods and levers can also be operated from the
channel side where the movement of the car is in plain view. By this
system the engine-man is able to give his entire attention to the drum
hoisting the other car, and there is less liability to accidents on account of
mistakes in signaling. As a further precaution each track is provided
with a derailing switch placed on the trestle approach about 18 feet from
the foot of the incline. In case of the cable breaking while the car is near
the top of the incline, the car could be thrown off the track and much less
damage done to life and property than if it ran away into the cut. For-
tunately, it has not yet been necessary to use this appliance.
The excavation of the channel is made by a series of longitudinal cuts.
In making the first cut, the incline was placed in position just far enough


33
from the right-of-way line, so that when the material was dumped it would
not spoil outside of the right-of-way. The first cut was about 8 feet deep
and about 45 feet wide at the top, bounded on one side by the slope of the
channel. The second cut was a widening and a deepening of the first cut
taking in about 25 feet of additional width and going down to 15 feet
below the surface. The third cut extended out to about 80 feet from the
elope stakes and to 20 feet in depth. After the third cut the succeeding
cuts were made of the same depth as the third cut, taking in 10 to 20 feet
additional width of excavation at each cut.
The slopes are roughly dressed with the steam shovels and then fin-
ished with plows, drag scrapers and hand shovels.
At present there are three steam shovels and inclined conveyors on
the north side of the channel and one on the south side, there being a
greater spoil area on the north side. The first inclined conveyor was put
in operation on Marsh 22d and the last on September 17th, 1894.
Generally after one cut is finished, the incline is moved a short dis-
tance (five feet or more) toward the channel, the trestle approach being
shortened on the berm and lengthened in the cut.
It is proposed to complete the 20-foot cut clear across the channel,
and then repeat the operation for the remaining 18 feet or so of the
required depth.
Working Capacity of Plant.—The largest average output per steam
shovel per 10-hour shift during any month was 968 cubic yards in July,
1894, when 87,926 cubic yards were excavated in 90.8 ten-hour shifts. Dur-
ing that month three plants were in operation, two working each 12 hours
per day all the month; one, 12 hours per day to the 11th and in two 10-
hour shifts for the balance of the month.
The largest steam shovel output during any month was 93,678 cubic
yards in December, 1894, when the average output per steam shovel per
10-hour shift was 808 cubic yards, there being 116 ten-hour shifts during
which work was done. During that month all four plants were in opera-
tion, two working each in two 10-hour shifts per day, and one working in
■one 10-hour shift per day.
The smallest average output during any month was 662 cubic yards in
August, 1894, when 72,061 cubic yards were excavated in 108.8 ten-hour
shifts.
In the above comparisons the first month, March, is not considered.
Each month is usually reckoned from about the 25th of the preceding
month to about the 25th of the month in question.
The total steam shovel output from March 22d, when plant com-
menced operations, to December 24th, 1894, was 623,483 cubic yards, exca-
vated in 829.1 ten-hour shifts, making the average output per steam shovel
per ten-hour shifts equal to 752 cubic yards.

WOODEN STAVE PIPE.
B. C. GEMMELL, B. S. '84.
In view of the rapidly increasing use of stave pipe and the widely-
varying opinions as to some of the details of construction, the above
subject certainly is an important one to any engineer who is already;or
who may expect soon to be, connected with the construction of works
for water-supply, sewerage, irrigation or water-power. In the West, and
particularly upon the Pacific Slope, where excellent lumber is so
plentiful and cheap, and iron and cement so dear, stave pipe will no
doubt continue to grow in favor, and be much used for conduits in con-
nection with water-works, and sewerage systems, and instead of box
flumes for irrigation systems and power plants. "Patronize Home In-
dustries" is the general cry of the West today, and, in the opinion of the
writer, the eastern manufacturers of iron and cement are very likely
to lose a constantly increasing percentage of their prospective western
trade.
HISTORICAL.
In this connection, a brief resume of the evolution of wooden stave
pipe may prove interesting. Something over one hundred years ago,
some of the towns on the Atlantic Slope began to feel the need of
municipal water supplies; and, as iron was so expensive, builders took
advantage of the most available material at hand, and bored logs were-
nsed in lieu of iron pipes. Time and experience have shown that they
probably " Builded better than they knew "; for, under light pressures^


these log pipes proved very durable, being frequently quite sound after
seventy or eighty years of service, only the outer sap wood showing
decay.
The first system of water-works in the United States was built at
Boston, in 1752. A small reservoir about 12 feet square was constructed
near the present "Dock Square", to which water was conveyed from
neighboring springs through wooden pipes—presumably bored logs.
In 1796, the "Aqueduct Corporation" was formed, and water was
brought from Jamaica Pond through three lines of pipes made from
bored logs, two lines being four inches in diameter, and one line three
inches. What is believed to be the second system in the United States,
was constructed at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, by Hans Chris. Christian-
son, a Danish millwright, in 1754. Water was taken from Menagassi
Creek, through a conduit 350 feet in length, to a well, whence it was
raised by means of a five inch lignum-vitse pump, through a force main
of bored hemlock logs, to a wooden tank in the village square, 70 feet
above the pump. The works were rebuilt in 1761, using a gum wood
force main and pitch pine distribution. Among other towns to con-
struct works of wooden pipes, we may mention New York City, where
the Manhattan Company began construction in 1779; Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, where bored pine logs, with faucet ends strengthened by
wrought iron bands, were laid in 1797; Burlington, New Jersey, where
the Aqueduct Company brought water from springs on the high ground
south of the town in 1804; Lynchburg, Virginia, where the Council
granted right of way through the streets to John Lynch in 1811; and
Springfield, Massachusetts, where three miles of 4, 6, and 7 inch bored
logs were laid in 1844.
The pipes laid at Lynchburg represent the method of construction
then in vogue. They were made in lengths of 10 feet, out of 10 inch
logs, with an internal diameter of three inches. The lengths were
jointed together like modern pump-logs. It was not until 1832 that
even New York and Philadelphia began to lay iron pipes.
Soon after iron pipes began to replace the bored logs in water-
works construction, there arose a demand among the growing manufac-
turing towns of New York and New England for large conduits, in con-
nection with water-power plants. Again, the cheapest material at hand
was made use of, and the conduits were constructed of wooden staves,
banded with flat, iron bands. These conduits were made in lengths of
about 12 feet, and were slightly conical in shape, so that the small end
of one length could be snugly fitted into the large end of the next. It
did not take long for practical men to learn that this method of joint-
ing was not the best construction that could be devised, and, about 1865,
they began to build continuous stave pipes by laying the staves so as to
break joints. We have record of a 12 inch pipe, 3£ miles long, made of


The Techkic
2| inch pine staves, constructed at Middletown, New York, in 1867; and
of many others, of larger diameters, built at different towns in New
York, and New England. The one of which we probably have the most
complete record is a six foot conduit, built at Manchester, New Hamp-
shire, by Mr. J. T. Fanning, C. E. This conduit is 600 feet long, and the
staves are of southern pitch pine, four inches thick, with edges dressed
to radial lines. Tne bands are 2£//x \" iron, flat, and made in two sec-
tions, fastened together in place and tightened by clamping bolts.
In 1884 Mr. C. P. Allen, Chief Engineer of the Denver Water
Company, constructed what may probably be termed the first modern
wooden stave pipe, though it is essentially the same as the conduit built
by Mr. Fanning, differing from it only in that the bands are round,
each hand in one piece, with its ends coupled together by a shoe.
The staves of the upper half were made of California redwood, and
the lower half of Colorado pine. This conduit is 48 inches in diameter.
DESCRIPTION.
The pipe designed and patented by Mr. Allen is made of staves,
dressed on the sides to arcs of circles, and on the edges to true rad-
ial lines, with a calking bead about TV inch high on one edge of each
starve. The staves have a saw kerf cut across the ends, for the insertion

of a metallic tongue. The saw kerf is not quite so wide as the thickness
of the tongue nor quite so deep as half its width, and the tongue is
about 1 inch longer than the width of the stave, necessitating a few


light blows of a hammer to drive it to place, and causing its ends to
penetrate the adjoining staves for about % inch when the beads are
tightened, thus securing a tight butt joint. The bands are made of
mild steel, are usually from three to five inches longer than the outside
circumference of the pipe, have a head on one end and a nut and thread
on the other, the thread being cut for a distance of about five inches.
The bands are slightly swelled under the head and the threaded ends
are upset, in order to make the bands of equal strength throughout
their entire length. The saddles, or coupling shoes, are made of mal-
leable cast-iron, so constructed that the strain of the band produces a
straight pull on the casting. This kind of pipe is shown by Figs 1, 2,
and 3.
The pine patented by Mr. Chas. W. Dwelle is shown by Figs 4, 5, and
6. The radial edges of the staves are dressed to what may probably be
called a very flat V shaped tongue and groove, with a small portion of
the V cut off. The butt joints are tongued and grooved. The shoes are
of malleable cast iron, and are so constructed that, in making the coup-
ling, the ends of each band overlap. The bands are threaded at both
ends, with a nut for each end.
The pipe invented and patented by Mr. A. Mc L. Hawks, shown by
Figs. 7, 8, and 9, differs from the Allen pipe in a few details only.
The staves are dressed with a calking seam, and the butt joints are
made by double dove-tail splines dressed to fit into corresponding
grooves in the ends of the staves. The bands are of round iron or steel,
but have corrugations put in, while cold, after the manner shown on
the plan.
SPECIFICATIONS.
Below are given specifications for the construction of an 18" stave
pipe for the water supply of Astoria, Oregon. They are intended to be
sufficiently general to permit any contractor who makes a specialty of
this kind of construction to bid on the work, providing he produces sat-
isfactory evidence that his pipe has been successfully built and used
elsewhere. The general plan shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, is intended to
represent the kind of pipe covered by Mr. Allen's patent, but is subject
to such modifications as are allowable under the specifications.
"Staves—The lumber from which the staves are made shall be first
class quality of what is locally known as Oregon or Washington yellow
fir, perfectly sound, reasonably straight grained, and wholly free from
knots, dry rot, pitch seams, cracks, shakes or other defects, and have
the grain parallel to the flat side or edge of the staves. No quarter
sawed staves will be accepted. The staves shall be dressed from lum-
ber not less than six inches in width nor less than two inches in thick-
ness, which shall have been sawed from green timber at least three


The Technic.
months preceding its manufacture into staves, the templates to be
approved by the Engineer, and any stave varying more than jV inch
in any part will not be received. They shall be furnished in lengths
varying from 12 to 24 feet, and not over 20 per cent, shall be under 14
feet in length. The ends shall be cut accurately square with all sides,
and shall be fitted with a sawed kerf for the insertion of a snug fitting
wrought iron or steel plate, No. 10 B. W. G., as shown on the plans, or
with a type of end joint that shall meet the entire approval of the
Engineer. The staves, after delivery upon the work, must be cared for,
to prevent any warping or distortion, as only staves found perfect in
every particular as the work progresses will be paid for or be permitted
to be used.
"Bands—The bands are to be ^ inch round steel, upset to J inch for
a length of four inches. The steel shall be " mild"; shall have a guar-
anteed tensile strength of not less than 60,000 pounds nor more than
68,000 pounds per square inch of section; a limit of elasticity of not less
than 35,000 pounds per square inch of section; an elongation in eight
inches of not less than 25 per cent.; and shall stand being bent cold
through 180 degrees and pounded fiat without showing any tendency to
crack. The bands shall be slightly swelled beneath the bolt heads; shall
be provided with the necessary standard threads, nuts and washers, and
be threaded at one end for a length of three and one-half inches. In
length the rods shall be such that when in place they shall extend
through the nuts a distance of not less than two inches nor more than
three.
"Saddles—The saddles shall be of malleable cast iron or steel. If of
the former, it shall be of the most tenacious character, such as will
stand a great amount of hammering without fracture, and shall have a
tensile strength of not less than 40,000 pounds per square inch of sec-
tion. If of the latter material, it shall be the equal in all respects of
that specified for the bands. The design of the saddle shall be such as
has been thoroughly tried on other similar work, and found excellent;
and must in any case be presented for the approval of the Engineer.
"Erection—The end joints shall be made by inserting a wrought iron
or steel plate. Joints in adjoining courses shall in no case be placed at
a less distance apart than one foot, and all end joint? of a course or
section of pipe shall be brought within a length of three feet, and at
each joint or section three extra bands must be placed. In connecting
the ends of the bands, the saddles shall be placed over longitudinal
joints, so as to be supported on two staves; and shall be distributed over
the upper half of the pipe in a uniform and regular order.
"Cinching— When the pipe has been set up, the bands shall be
brought to a bearing, and the pipe shall be perfectly rounded out to its


39
true shape. The bands shall be cinched so as to produce as uniform a
tension as possible, brace wrenches being used.
"Spacing—The bands shall be so spaced as to secure a factor of safety
of not less than four, assuming the diameter of the pipe to be the nom-
inal diameter plus three times the thickness of the stave.
"Connections—Where it may be necessary to make connections be-
tween the wood stave pipe and special castings, it shall be done by
using a hub of extra depth; and by filling the joint entirely full of
oakum well hammered in.
"Straining of Bands—In the erection and filling of pipe, great care
must be exercised by the contractor to prevent overstraining of the
bands.
"Test—The final, test of the satisfactory fulfilment of the above re-
quirement shall be that no band, on being removed from the pipe after
the latter has been subjected to its natural working pressure for at least
thirty consecutive days, shall show any appreciable fixed increase in its
original length; and the failure of five per cent, of the bands examined
to meet this requirement shall be deemed sufficient ground for the re-
jection of the entire work until such defects have been entirely repaired
in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer.
"Coating—All iron work shall be coated after the manner specified
for the steel pipe to be used in the conduit, except the metallic tongues
used in making the butt connections; and these shall receive the
"kalameining" process in the sheets or bands from which they are cut,
or such other treatment as in the opinion of the Engineer will render
them practically non-corrodible.
"Refilling—The contractor who builds the pipe will be required to do
so much of the backfilling as is necessary to cover the pipe to the depth
of six inches, thoroughly tamping the earth under and around the
pipe. The contractor on excavation will do the remainder of the back-
filling after the pipe shall have been tested and made tight.
"How Estimated—The weight of the steel used in the bands, includ-
ing the nuts only, and the number of feet, board measure, necessary for
the construction of the staves, will alone be made the basis of payment;
and the )prices named in the proposal for these articles shall include
compensation for furnishing all materials and labor, except such as are
separately mentioned in the form for proposals, necessary for the entire
completion of the wood stave conduit, including the placing of all
gates, specials, stand-pipes and air valves, according to the full intent
and meaning of these specifications."
erection.
The pipe is constructed in place in the trench. First, the lower
half of the staves is laid inside of [/-shaped forms; then inside forms are


placed in the trough thus formed, and the upper half of the staves is
laid up, the staves being made to break butt joints. The bands are
slipped on and, while they are being adjusted, the staves are carefully
rounded out and driven home. In order to facilitate the tightening of
the bands, it is customary to so place them as to bring the shoes to
about the horizontal diameter of the pipe, alternating the shoes on
either side. It is also customary to defer the final tightening of the
bands until the day after the pipe is laid, when the nuts are screwed
down with a brace wrench until the bands are brought up to their
proper tension. The pipe is generally built in sections, the gangs of
pipe layers being placed from 1,000 to 2,000 feet apart. Where two sec-
tions meet, the closing staves are cut from j\ inch to $ inch long, thus
causing them to buckle out until pulled into place by the tightening of
the bands, and making the buckle joints the tightest of all.
For the minimum radii of curves, some builders recommend 125 feet
for a pipe one foot in diameter, 210 feet feet for a two foot pipe and 350
feet for a three foot pipe. Mr. Wm. Ham. Hall states that, for a pipe
52 inches in diameter, " The curves could not be made much less than
250 feet with staves two inches thick, or less than 300 feet with staves 2.6-


inches thick, on account of the difficulty of forcing them into the re-
quisite curve, jackscrews, blocks and tackles being required for this
purpose." In locating the line for the 18 inch pipe for Astoria,
Oregon, the minimum radius of curvature was taken at 200 feet.
The speed of laying depends upon the pressure to which the
pipe is to be subjected—or, in other words, upon the number of bands
per unit of length of the pipe—as well as upon the diameter of the pipe.
On the conduits built at Denver, a pipe laying gang consisted of from 8
to 16 men, according to the number of bands to be placed, one half of
the gang usually being employed in back-cinching. Mr. Schuyler states
that " On the 34 inch pipe, the gangs usually placed 700 to 1000 bands
per day, laying from 150 to 300 feet of pipe. On the 44 inch pipe the
rate was about 500 bands per day."

PRACTICAL DETAILS.
The position of each band is marked upon the top of the pipe by the
foreman in charge of the pipe-laying, who is furnished by the Engineer
with a profile upon which is marked the proper spacing. The formula
used for the spacing of the bands on the pipe built for the water-works
of Denver, Colorado, as given by Mr. James D. Schuyler, Consulting
Engineer, was:
N - 1200 d p
2s,
where N = number of bands per 100 feet,


The Technic.
d — diameter of pipe in inches,
p = pressure in pounds per square inch,
8 = safe working strain in pounds, for bands when threaded for
use, determined by regular tests at the mills where they were made.
"In making up the table for the distribution of the bands, values of
8 were taken as follows:
| inch bands, plain s = 1000
| inch bands, upset s =• 1200
i inch bands, plain s = 2000
J inch bands, upset s = 2500
| inch bands, plain s = 3000
| inch bands, upset s = 3500"
These values of ? give a factor of safety of about five, though sometimes
as low a factor as three is used. These factors may be taken as the
allowable minimum and maximum. Changes in the rate of spacing are
made for every rive feet change of head, except that for low heads the
maximum distance between bands should be fixed at 18 inches, and this
should be used only under favorable circumstances and when the back-
filling is to be thoroughly tamped around the pipe.
It is claimed by some makers that small knots, where they extend
through and not across the stick, do not occur of tener than once in every
two feet in length of the stave, and none within one foot of the end of
the stave, are not so objectionable as to justify the expense of requiring
perfectly clear stuff. If the pipe is to be subjected to considerable
pressure, however, it would seem to be good economy to use clear lum-
ber.
As to seasoning, Mr. Schuyler states that, for redwood, " lumber
must be thoroughly dry and seasoned before milling, and after milling,
the sooner it is built into the pipe the better." Redwood in addition to
being very soft, possesses the property of shrinkage (or swelling, as the
case may be) very slightly transversely and very considerably longitu-
dinally. By using it well seasoned, then, there is probably little danger
of setting up any great strain in the bands after the water is turned on,
and perhaps the longitudinal expansion would only serve to make the
butt joints tighter. When staves are to be made of fir, sometimes the
requirement is that the lumber shall be cut, milled and built into the
work as quickly as possible. Experience shows that shrinkage of red
fir from a green state to a state of even partial seasoning is fully i%;
hence it is argued that, in using it without special appliances for taking
up the swelling, it should be put in green. Exception might be taken to
this, however, by reason of the fact that green red fir shrinks to a cer-
tain extent even under water, thus perhaps causing loose joints and
leakage; and also, because of the danger of the sap in the wood causing
decay. With the pipe under considerable pressure, however, it might


43
be said that the water would force out the sap and penetrate the pores
of the wood so thoroughly as to effectually prevent any decay or shrink-
age.
It is claimed by some that an outside coating of asphaltum preser-
ves the outer surface of the staves and prevents the evaporation of the
water that penetrates the pores of the wood from the inside. By others
it is claimed, that the water itself is a sufficient preservative, and
that the floating of the staves in a bath of asphaltum is sure to leave
some of it on the radial edges and the ends, making it difficult to get
tight joints; while if the coating is put on with a brush, it is hard to make
the asphaltum stick to the wood.
There is another question, namely, as to what should be the proper
thickness for staves. Starting with a safe deflection for a thick new
stave, if decay does take place, there may be eventually an excessive
deflection, to say nothing of leakage resulting from loosening of the
bands. Again, the velocity of the water is generally high, and if the
staves are thin when first put in, and the water not clear, there will be
so much wear on the inside as to materia Jy shorten the life of the pipe.
To secure the longest life for the staves, it would probably be best to
coat them thoroughly on the outside with hot asphaltum, put on with
a brush; and to make them thick enough to absolutely prevent any ap-
preciable deflection, when using bands of the most economical sizes,
spaced for a factor of safety of four. Generally, the thickness varies
from one and a quarter inches for pipe one foot in diameter, to three
inches for pipe nine feet in diameter. On the Santa Ana Canal in Cali-
fornia, the staves of pipe 52 inches in diameter were two inches thick
for pressures under 50 feet; 2 3 inches, from 50 to 100 feet; and 2.6 inches
for all pressures over 100 feet. Staves are usually about five and three-
quarter inches wide.
The advocates of metallic tongues for the butt joints claim that in
using wooden splines it is hard to make a good fit, while those using
the splines claim that the acid in fir will corrode metal tongues. Prob-
ably either method makes a good joint. Some builders even claim that
neither tongues nor splines are necessary in order to make tight joints.
It is sometimes specified that shoes shall not be placed closer than a
certain distance to butt joints, but this is generally considered a matter
of small importance. The butt joints are " staggered" so that no two
are closer together than about one foot.
In order that the seams may be tight, it is necessary that the staves
should press against each other with a pressure per square inch at least
somewhat in excess of the pressure of the water. This is an important
matter, and the cinching can be properly done only by skillful and ex-
perienced workmen. When comparatively hard unyielding timber in a
seasoned condition is used, it would appear that, with the bands very


The Technic.
tightly drawn at the time of construction, the swelling of the staves
might strain the bands beyond the limit of elasticity. That such dan-
ger is recognized is shown by Mr. McHawks, he having sought a solution
of the difficulty by making a number of corrugations in each band. It
would seem that this effort to obviate the difficulty would require very
careful adjustment of the corrugations, and some practical experiment-
ing, to determine just what character of corrugation would remain
wholly unyielding under the working strain, and yet yield sufficiently
ta take up the swelling well before the limit of elasticity of the band
was reached. Again, with strains existing in the bands just sufficient to
cause a yielding in the corrugations, there is a probability that any ad-
ditional and unusual increase in the water pressure might produce a
permanent " set," leaving the bands more or less loose after the unusual
pressure had subsided, thereby causing leakage of the pipe.
In order that there may be as few leaks as possible, it is well to turn
the water into the pipe very slowly, and to allow the staves to soak for
as long a time as practicable, before turning on the full pressure. To
prevent the collapsing of the pipe when the water is drawn off suddenly,
air valves should be provided at summits; and at points where the pipe
comes close enough to the hydraulic grade line to render it practicable.


it is a good idea to connect air pipes with the conduit. Blow-offs should
be put in at all depressions, for flushing purposes. If valves are inser-
ted in the conduit, for the purpose of speedily shutting off the water in
the lower reaches of the line when necessary, an overflow pipe should
be put in just above the gate and an air cock or valve just below it.
The overflow pipe is to prevent undue pressure being put upon that
part of the pipe above the gate.
MAXIMUM PRESSURE.
A question frequently asked is "What is the maximum pressure
under which stave pipe can be successfully used?" Generally the ans-
wer is that the bands can be proportioned and spaced to stand almost
any pressure, and that all depends upon the hardness and strength of
the timber. The prevailing idea among engineers seems to be that, for
a safe limit, a pressure of about 100 pounds per square inch should not
be exceeded. The 30 inch conduit built at Denver in 1890, is, for a por-
tion of its length, under a head of 220 feet. The probability is that this
pipe can safely be used at all pressures under which it can successfully
compete with iron pipe in the matter of first cost.
DURABILITY.
The life of the pipe depends to a great extent upon the nature and
composition of the soil in which it is laid, and will be much greater in
compact clayey soils than in loose gravelly soils. Soil containing al-
kaline or other mineral matter shortens the life of the pipe. The
staves, being saturated with water, will last much longer than the bands,
but the bands can easily be renewed when necessary. A conservative
estimate of the life of the bands in ordinary soils is 20 years, though, if
they are properly coated, it would not seem unreasonable, in the light
of past" experience, to expect them to last much longer. The staves
wear out slowly on the inside, the rapidity of such wear depending to a
great extent upon the condition of the water, whether clear or laden
with silt and grit. Bored pine logs, laid at Portsmouth, N. H., in 1797,
when removed in 1870, were found to be sound, but they were worn on
the inside from a diameter of five inches to eight inches, as was shown
by knots projecting on the inside. Mr. B. H. Hull of Bridgeport, Con-
necticut, a builder of over forty years' experience, estimates the life of
stave pipe, when laid above ground, at from forty to fifty years, and
considers its life indefinite when laid under ground.
ADVANTAGES.
Wood stave pipe possesses many advantages over iron pipe, the
greatest being the comparatively low first cost. Regarding the 30 inch
conduit built at Denver, Mr. Schuyler states that interest at 6% on the


The Technic.
difference in cost would permit of the reconstruction of the entire line
of wooden pipe every five and one-half years, when compared with cast-
iron pipe, and every nine and one-third years, when compared with
wrought iron pipe. The cost of the 16.4 miles of this conduit averaged
$1.36J per linear foot. The cost of the 18 inch conduit to be built at As-
toria, Oregon, according to contract prices, will be $0,576 under 25 feet
head; $0.6516, under 75 feet head; $0.8784 under 100 feet head; $1.1134
under 159 feet head; and $1.1808 under 165 feet head. These figures in-
clude all items of cost incident to the construction of the pipe, connecting
air valves, air pipes and blow-offs, and the f urnishing of all materials.
The cost of 52 inch redwood stave pipe on the Santa Ana Canal was
as follows: Warm Springs line, ool feet long; maximum head, 61 feet;
staves two inches thick; minimum spacing of bands 5i inches, maxi-
mum 12 inches; $3.08 per linear foot. Deep Canon line, 1)64.4 feet long;
maximum head, 160 feet; staves, 2, 2.3 and 2.6 inches thick; minimum
spacing of bands two and one-eighth inches, maximum 12 inches; $5.84
per linear foot.' Morton Canon line, 756 feet long, maximum head, 158
feet; staves. 2, 2.3 and 2.6 inches thick; minimum spacing of bands two
and one-eighth inches, maximum 12 inches; $6.71 per linear foot. Four
miles of 24 inch redwood stave pipe for the water supply of Ogden,
Utah, averaged $1.26 per linear footjmaximum head, 100 feet;minimum
spacing of three-eighth inch bands two and three-quarter inches, maxi-
mum 12 inches.
The cost of common labor at Denver was from $1.75 to $2.00 per day;
of lumber, $27.50 per thousand, B. M., in place;of a half inch steel band
with shoe, about 20 cents; of erection, 5.1c. per band, contract price.
The work on the Santa Ana Canal, and at Ogden and Astoria was let by
contract, with cost of common labor the same as at Denver. The pipes
on the Santa Ana canal were constructed on sharp horizontal or vertical
curves for the greater part of their lengths.
Another important point is that the inside of the pipe is clean and
smooth, with no troublesome growths of tubercles; rendering it entirely
safe, when calculating the mean velocity of the water by Kutter's for-
mula, to assume "jV" = .010; the wood becoming smoother with use,
instead of rougher, as is the case with iron. Careful measurements of
flow made at Denver showed that " N" = .0096. Mr. Schuyler estimates
the difference in carrying capacity in favor of wooden pipe over cast-
iron, at "about 16%, as far as deductions are warranted from observa-
tion covering a limited range of diameters." No yarn is used in making
the joints, to cause contamination of the water or obstruct its free flow.
Again, the pipe is not so liable to injury resulting from settlement,
earthquakes or water hammer. It is built continuously in the trench,
involves no difficulty in handling, and a defective stave, band or shoe
is a very small matter as compared with a defective length of iron pipe.


47
It is not difficult, and requires but a short time, to replace a defective
band or stave. Leaks rarely occur along the longitudinal seams, and
any leaks that do occur result in no great damage to property and are
usually repaired by a few wooden wedges.
Last, but not least, the staves are generally a product of HOME
MANUFACTURE.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL PROJECT.
FRANK P. DAVIS, C. E. '76.
For more than four centuries the commerce of Western Europe has
sought a short passage to China, Japan and the further Indies. This
was the aim of Columbus. It was this that lead to the discovery of
America. How nearly this great navigator came to finding the most
favorable route for a water communication between the two oceans
he never knew. When confronted with a mighty continent, he began
at once to search for a passage through, to find out the "Secret of the
Straits." In 1502 he examined all the bays, inlets and rivers from Cape
Gracias a' Dioz to a point probably a little below the present town of
Colon, and actually entered the San Juan River, the outlet of Lake
Nicaragua, but does not appear to have explored it for any distance.
After the discovery of the Pacific Ocean in 1513, the search for a
passage was renewed with even greater ardor than before. Failing to
find a passage, attention began to be directed toward an artificial means
of communication, and as early as 1531 a canal by way of the Chagres
River was proposed by Charles V., of Spain, who ordered it explored.
His engineers, more wise than their French brethern of the present cen-
tury, reported it as impracticable.
As early as 1550 a canal by way of the San Juan River, and Lake
Nicaragua was proposed by Antonio Galvao, a Portuguese navigator.
As the narrow neck of land extending from Mexico to South Amer-
ica was explored, several routes came prominently before the public
which will be named in regular order beginning with the most northerly.
1st. The Isthmus of Tehuantepec.
2d. The Nicaragua Route.
3d. The Isthmus of Panama.
4th. The San Bias and Chepo Route.
5th. The Caledonian Bay and Manti Route.
6th. The Caledonian Bay and Swenlti Route.
7th. The DePuydt Route.
8th. The Cucurica and Tuyra Route.
9th. The Atrato-Tmando Route.
10th. The Atrato-Napipi Route.


The Technic.
In the year 1872 a commission consisting of Brig.-Gen. A. A. Hum-
phreys, Chief of Engineers, U. S. A., Capt. C. C. Patterson, Superinten-
dent of the U. S. Coast Survey, and Admiral David Ammen, U. S. N.,
Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, were appointed by Gen. U. S.
Grant, President of the United States, "to examine into, make sugges-
tions, and report upon the subject of inter-oceanic ship canal commu-
nication."
In 1876 they reported as follows:
"After a long, careful and minute study of the several surveys of
the various routes across the continent, we unanimously report that the
route known as the Nicaragua possesses, both for construction and
maintenance of a canal, greater advantages and offers fewer difficul-
ties from engineering, commercial and economic points of view than
any of the other routes shown to be practicable by surveys sufficiently
in detail to enable a judgment to be formed of their relative merits."
To go backward a little in point of time, in 1849 Commodore Van-
derbilt and associates obtained from the Government of Nicaragua a
concession to build a canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the San
Juan River and Lake Nicaraugua. They had through surveys made
by Col. O. W. Childs, who reported the project as perfectly practicable,
and to him belongs the credit of having discovered the lowest known
pass across the continent; the highest point being only 152 feet above
the ocean. Soon after the discovery of gold in California, Commodore
Vanderbilt with his usual sagacity saw that this was likely to become
one of the great highways to the Golden Gates of the Pacific.
Greytown.and San Juan del Sur, possessed fine harbors, the San Juan
River and Lake Nicaraugua, afforded navigable water for all but 12
miles of the distances between the two oceans. Steamers were put on
the river and lake, a line Macadam road was built from the lake to the
Pacific. For years this was one of the most popular routes to California.
Then a fleet might ride at anchor in the Harbor of Grey town, but as
time went on the low spit of sandy beach known as Punta Arenas, or
Punta Castilla, which protected the anchorage, gradually grew to the
westward until the entrance was closed and Greytovvn Harbor was cut off
from the sea. The cause of the closing of this harbor and the plan
adopted for its restoration will be referred to later.
The proposed canal begins at San Juan del Norte (Grey town) on the
Caribbean Sea, and proceeds in a westerly direction in an almost straight
line across the country for a distance of thirty-two miles to Ochoa, where
it strikes the San Juan River. From there to Lake Nicaragua it follows
the river, thence across the lake to the mouth of the Lajas River, thence
up the valleys of the Lajas and Guiscoyal. cutting through the Conti-
nental Divide to the valley of the Rio Grande which it follows to the
Pacific at Borito.


49
A study of the accompanying map, Plate I, will help to understand
the more detailed description which follows.
From Greytown Harbor for the first ten miles the canal runs through
a low flat country, interspersed with swamps and lagoons of semi-liquid
mud whose only inhabitants are the tropical wild fowl, and the slow-
moving alligator, who slips from the muddy banks into the water with
a noiseless "swish" and diappears, or floats with his eyes just above
water, wondering what intruders have ventured to trespass on his
domain.
Through this low ground the canal will be excavated by means of
dredges, which will deposit the material on the bank, forming levees to
shut out the water from the surrounding swamps. This is the easiest
portion of the canal to build, as the work can all be rapidly and cheaply
done by machinery.
About ten miles from Greytown, hills begin to appear, and narrow
in the valley of the "Deseado," a beautiful mountain stream which
comes down from the high hills in the interior. By taking advantage
of favorable locations, three dams will be thrown across the valley
within a distance of 2| miles, forming three miniature lakes, whose
surfaces will be respectively 30 feet, 61 feet and 106 feet above the level
of the ocean. At each dam there will be a lock, numbered 1, 2 and 3 in
regular order going westward. The locks will have lifts respectively of
30 feet, 31 feet and 45 feet. The level of 106 feet which will be the height
above lock No. 3 is four feet below the proposed low water level of
Lake Nicaragua, and is considered a part of the summit level.
It is assumed that this four feet will be taken up in the fall of the
river between the lake and Ochoa, a distance of 64.5 miles. As the sur-
face of the water in the lake must never fall below 110 feet in order to
maintain the requisite depth in the canal west of the lake, and in the
river at the outlet of the lake, the writer is of the opinion that the
level of 110 feet ought to be maintained in the river to Ochoa and in
the canal from Ochoa to Lock No. 3.
Proceeding westward from Lock No. 3, at a distance of about 17
miles from Greytown, a high spur puts out from the higher hills to the
north. This is marked on the map as the " Divide." From base to base
at the water level of the canal this Divide is 2.9 miles. The average
depth of cutting to the bottom of the canal is 141 feet. The greatest
depth is 331 feet. In this 2.9 miles is concentrated over one-fifth
of all the excavation on the entire work. Careful borings, at frequent
intervals, with the diamond drill show that there is a layer of stiff clay
from 40 to 60 feet in thickness, below which is a volcanic rock. Most
-of this rock is rather soft but it is believed that it will stand at ordinary
rock slopes. At all the borings when once rock was struck, it was con-
tinuous to the bottom of the canal.


The Technic.
From the western base of the Divide to the San Juan River at Ochoa,
12.5 miles, there is a series of valleys, the surfaces of which are below
the bottom of the canal. By building dams across these valleys and
raising the water to the elevation of the summit level, three large arti-
ficial lakes will be formed with water varying from 30 feet to 60 feet in
depth. These valleys are separated by narrow and low ridges through
which cuttings will be made. To flood these valleys there will be re-
quired five dams, varying in length from 400 feet to 1200 feet with a height
above the level of the valleys of 65 feet. These dams will apparently
rest on clay foundations at depths of from 30 feet to 40 feet below the sur-
face. There will also be several thousand lineal feet of embankments
varying in height from 6 feet to 40 feet to close gaps in the hills sur-
rounding these basins, which are below the flowage line.
These basins, as well as those to the east of the Divide are important
features in the plan. In this region rainfall of 10 inches in twenty-four
hours, and 30 inches in six days have been recorded. The streams flow-
ing in these valleys are subject to sudden and violent floods. To pass
these under the canal would be very expensive. To admit them into
the normal sections of the canal would be ruinous. Ample waste-weirs
will be provided to safely pass the greatest floods. These large basins
will act as equalizers of the flow and pass the water to the waste-weirs
without causing objectionable cross-currents. They will also afford
ample room for vessels to pass, and enable them to run at a higher rate
of speed than would be possible in the regular section of the canal.
They will also reduce the amount of excavation enormously.
AtOchoa a dam 1600 feet in length and 65 feetin heightwill be built
across the San Juan River to raise the water to the summit level, thus
affording slack-water navigation in the river to the lake, 64.5 miles. At
this point the river has a depth of from 8 feet to 14 feet at ordinary
stages of water, with a low water discharge of about 14,500 cubic feet
per second.* The bottom is a cemented gravel or hardpan, prob-
ably underlaid by rock at a moderate depth.
The river from Ochoa to the lake has an average width of from 800
to 1500 feet, and will have a depth of from 30 feet to 65 feet. To secure
this depth there will be dredging and rock blasting in the upper part of
the river for a distance of 28 miles. In this portion the bottom width
will be 125 feet.
Lake Nicaragua, the source of the San Juan River, has a length of
about 110 miles and an average width of about 30 miles. It has a sur-
face area of about 2600 square miles, and a drainage area of about 8,000
•Report of Commander E. P. Luell, U. S. N.


51
square miles. Its low water level is 96.6 feet1 and high water 110.6 feet.'
Its discharge at ordinary low water is given by Col. O. W. Childs as
11,390 cubic feet per second. Commander Luell reports it 13,000 cubic
feet at Machuca Eapids in May 1873. Col. Childs estimated the max-
imum discharge as 18,059 cubic feet per second. The writer does not
think this is large enough. Commander Luell's survey at Machuca
showed a width of 630 feet with an average depth of 2J feet and a
discharge of 13,000 feet. As a steamer of 10 feet draught has passed up
these rapids, there must have been at least 12 feet of water at that time,
which would indicate a discharge far in excess of Col. Child's estimate.
The writer has seen several floods in the [ river when the discharge
would appear to have been far in excess of that estimate.
Without this lake a canal at this point would not be practicable.
Aside from its benefit as an integral portion of the canal, it will act as
an immense storage reservoir, to hold back the floods of the rainy sea-
son for use in the dry season, thus rendering the flow of the upper part
of the rivei much more uniform than it would otherwise be.
The whole isthmus from Mexico to South America is a mountain-
ous region, with steep slopes and short streams, most of which in the
rainy season are uncontrollable torrents, and which during the dry
season dwindle to insignificant creeks or entirely disappear. Lake
Nicaragua is probably the only natural source of supply from Tehuan-
tepec to South America which would furnish sufficient water to operate
a ship canal with locks. The minimum flow of the San Juan Eiver at
Ochoa is eight or ten times what would be required to operate the canal
to its full capacity.
The lake will be utilized for a distance of 56.5 miles. In this dis-
tance dredging will be required for about 14 miles near the outlet, and
rock excavation for about half a mile at the mouth of the Rio Lajas,
where the canal will leave the lake. At this point there is no harbor,
there will, therefore, be two breakwaters built, one on each side of the
entrance. These breakwaters will have lengths of about 1800 feet and
2400 feet. They would afford very little, if any, protection to vessels at
anchor, nor is there sufficient area for an anchorage. As there is no har-
bor on the west side of the lake, and no protection for vessels at anchor
near than the lea of the volcanoes of Ometepe and Maidera, it would
seem that some other provision ought to be made.
Leaving the lake, the canal immediately enters a cut about nine miles
long, through the Continental Divide. The maximum depth of cutting

will be 72 feet to the bottom of the canal. Borings show that this cut will
be largely rock, of about the same quality as that in the Eastern Divide.
To reduce the cutting as much as possible, the line follows the val-
leys of the Lajas and the Guiscajal for a distance of about 4 miles.
For most of this distance it will be necessary to divert these streams
into new channels, which will carry the drainage of the surrounding
country into the lake.
After crossing the Divide the line enters the valley of the Rio
Grande, a mountain stream which comes down from the south and runs
into a narrow and tortuous valley. In the dry season the stream
entirely disappears for long distances, but in the wet season the How is
estimated by Mr. A. G. Menocal, the Chief Engineer of the company,
as 10,000 cubic feet per second.1 To take care of this stream it is pro-
posed to build a dam across the valley a short distance above where
the canal enters it and to cut a new channel to the eastward across the
Divide between the Rio Grande and the Juan Davila, a tributary of the
Lajas, thus turning the water into Lake Nicaragua.
About H miles from where the canal enters it, the valley of the Rio
Grande widens out into what is known as the Tola Basin. About oj
miles below this point the valley again contracts to a width of about
1800 feet, with high hills on both sides. It is proposed to connect these
hills by a dam 70 feet high and Hood the valley up to the end of^the
long cut through the Divide. The basin thus Hooded would be 5} miles
long with an extreme width of 3i miles. The summit level would
extend from this dam east to within 12J miles of the Atlantic, a distance
of 153 miles.
Locks Nos. 4 and 5 will be located in a hill immediately at the north
end of the dam. Each will have a lift of feet. At this point there
is probably the finest site for graving docks in the world. They could
be cut out of solid rock, filled and emptied without pumping, and have
abundant water power for all necessary ships. Immediately below this
dam the valley widens out again and has a very uniform descent of
about 10 feet to the mile to the Pacific Ocean. Abo.it 1.6 miles
from Lock No. 5 is Lock No. 6, which will bring the canal
down to the level of the sea. This lock has a lift varying from
21 feet to 29 feet depending on the state of the tide. From here to the
proposed harbor at Brito, a distance of 0.6 miles, the canal will be

Brito Harbor, so-called, is not a harbor at all, but there does not
appear to be any great difficulty in constructing one. On the north
side of the canal directly at the coast there is a high rocky hill that

puts out into the sea in a south-easterly direction forming a small
but shallow cove. It is proposed to build a stone breakwater out from
this point about 900 feet, and another from the shore on the east side
of the canal about 800 feet in length. These breakwaters will be nearly
at right angles to each other, and will have an opening between the ends
of about 600 feet. A sufficient area for anchorage purposes will be
dredged to a depth of 30 feet. As the wind is off shore for nine or ten
months out of the year and there appears to be but little or no travel
to the sand along the beach, there would seem no doubt as to the
entire success of the plan.

The Technic.
The foregoing table shows how small a proportion of the distance
is Canal entirely in excavations. Of the 121.04 miles classed as natural
waterways, about 43 miles will be partly in excavation. The greatest
distance where vessels could not pass is 4.92 miles, and the total dis-
tance where they could not is 13.17 miles. The large proportion of
basins, river and lake will enable a much higher rate of speed to be
maintained than would be possible in a narrow canal.
As about 155 miles of the canal will be in absolutely fresh water, a
journey through will be of almost as much benefit to a vessel in clean-
ing her bottom of any marine growth as would a docking and scraping.
DAMS.
It was at first proposed to build the larger dams with concrete, but
as none of them would have rock foundations, and as fears have been
expressed in regard to their stability on account of earthquakes, it has
been decided to construct what are known as rock fill dams. That is,
simply dump in rock and allow it to find its own bed and take its own
slope, putting in a sufficient quantity to render them safe beyond all
question. Owing to the large amount of rock to be taken out of the
Divide cuts, which would otherwise be wasted, the rock can be put into
the dams at an extra cost of but little more than the hauling. As the
water supply is so greatly in excess of the amount required, it is not
necessary that these dams should be water tight. They would undoubt-
edly eventually become so.
It has been proposed to allow the water to How freely over the crest
of these dams, thus utilizing them for waste wiers. In view of the
height of the dams, and the great drainage which would result from
the failure of one, it would seem to be more prudent to rely entirely
upon masonry waste-weirs, built at some distance from the dams in
natural earth or rock and not to allow any water to pour over the
dams. It is proposed to build waste-weirs at various points in addition
to the dams, but it would seem to be safer not to use the dams as such.
LOCKS.
The studies for the locks have not been made public.
The dimensions of the lock chambers were fixed at 650 feet by 80
feet, with lifts varying from 21 feet to 45 feet. This latter lift may
seem excessive, but the studies may have shown to be entirely practi-
cable. The old-fashioned miter gate appears to be the most economical
to construct as well as the easiest to operate.
As there is no good building stone known to exist in the vicinity of
the canal the locks will be built of concrete. They will be so designed
as to be operated in the least possible time. Some have questioned the
stability of masonry structures in this region on account of earth-


55
■quakes. Of course it is impossible to say what may happen, but judg-
ing from the past this need not occasion any serious alarm. In the
immediate vicinity of the canal there are masonary dams and indigo
vats in perfect condition which are known to have been built over 100
years. Earthquake shocks are frequent but generally not severe.
Major Clarence Dutton, U. S. A., an acknowledged authority on seismic
disturbances has made a study of this region and expresses the opinion
that there is no reason to anticipate trouble from this source.
AUXILIARY WORKS.
The country from Qreytown to Ochoa is as perfect a wilderness as
can be found on the face of the globe. It is a succession of steep hills,
deep valleys, swamps and lagoons. In making the surveys the only
means of transporting supplies was by canoes in shallow streams where
more time was spent in hauling the boats over logs than in canoeing, or
in the absence of streams to pack the supplies on men's backs over slip-
pery hills and through deep swamps in pouring rains. To transport sup-
plies and plant, as well as to haul rock from the Divide cuts, to the sites
of the various dams and breakwaters, a railroad was a necessity from
Grey town to Ochoa, and from the lake to Brito. A location for a railroad
has been made following approximately the line of the canal. As the
location had to be kept above the flowage line in the basins, the profile
shows unusually heavy work. It will be an expensive line to build
and maintain.
Ten miles of this line from Greytown west has been built. The
first four miles was through swamp where the water was from two to
four feet deep. It was constructed by first building a corduroy of fal-
len timber to above water, upon which the track was laid. Sand was
then hauled in by trains and the track gradually raised until it was
about two feet above high water. After striking the hills much trouble
was experienced from the slopes of the cuts sliding. Ties made
from the native timber growing along the line would rot out in
from four to six months. On this account cypress ties from
Louisiana and creosoted pine from North Carolina were tried. When
last seen by the writer, the cypress had been in about two and a half
years, and were fairly well preserved. The creosoted ties were not sat-
isfactory, they were so soft that the rails cut into them badly, and even
with rail braces it was difficult to keep the spikes from drawing and
the rails from spreading.
WATER SUPPLY.
The headquarters of the company, near Greytown, are on a narrow
sand beach, varying in width from a quarter to a half mile, back of which
is swamp for several miles. The water from the swamps slowly perco-


The Technic.
lates through the sand toward the sea, and is found anywhere at a depth
of from two to six feet. As this water is more or less contaminated,
water works were planned to bring a supply from a small stream which
rises in the hills about 12 miles from Qreytown. The source of supply
has an elevation of 100 feet. The site for the reservoir was cleared and
much of the pipe distributed but not laid. The employes depended
entirely on rain water during the time the work was in progress.
On the Western Division during the dry season which lasts from
Kovember to May, the Lajas and Rio Grande become insignificant
streams, and in places entirely disappear. It will undoubtedly be neces-
sary to laya pipe-line from Lake Nicaraguaand putina pumping plant.
GREYTOWN IIAKUOR.
As has been stated, prior to 1862 Greytown possessed a ine harbor
with ample water.
Plate II* shows the harbor as it existed in 1832 and the changes
which occurred up to 1859.
A still older chart published in Madrid, 1809, shows the sand spit
known as Punta Arenas or Punta Castilla enclosing and protecting the
harbor, but the point of it appears to have been about half a mile to
the eastward of where it was in 1832, and shows scarcely a trace of the
secondary delta of the San Juan which appears in the chart of 1832. A
study of the locality as well as the various charts would seem to indi-

cate that at some time the main branch of the river had its outlet in
the vicinity of the present Tauro mouth, or a few miles to the southeast
of Harbor Head, and that as its delta was pushed out into the sea it
formed the bight which eventually became Greytown Harbor.
The sand brought down by the river was acted upon by the waves
which come in from a northeasterly direction, and forced to the west-
ward, forming a sand spit which enclosed a deep water bay, affording
a commodious and safe anchorage. From year to year this spit
advanced, making the protection to the harbor more complete,- but
gradually narrowing the entrance. At the same time the branch of the
river which empties at Greytown, usually spoken of as the Lower San
Juan, was depositing the material which it brought down and forming
a secondary delta within the harbor as shown on the charts of 1832 and
1888.
There have been two theories advanced to account for the closing
of the harbor. One is that at one time the main outlet of the river was
near Greytown, and that its large volume of water and strong current
was able to maintain an outlet against the sea and dispose of the debris
which it carried. This does not seem reasonable, for reasons which
have been very closely stated by Prof. Henry Mitchell of the U. S.
Coast Survey.1
"1st. Standing upon the outer beach of Punta Arenas, I have
been witness to the movement of the sand to the westward. The waves
drive on diagonally (at an angle of 45°), carrying up the strand gravel,
shells, etc, which upon the recoil, are for the most part, carried down
again to the sea, but in a direction normal to the shore line. In this
way, by a zigzag movement, the sands, etc., travel slowly along the
coast, and pile themselves against the main shore to leeward. It is pre-
cisely the same movement that has formed Long Point at Provincetown
and Sandy Hook at New York. The only difference is that at Province-
town or New York we have the mole in that earlier stage of its forma-
tion at which it acts as a breakwater and not a barrier."
"2d. The sands, etc., composing Punta Arenas are like many other
beaches, as far as regards the size of the grains, etc., both on the ocean
and basin sides* In other words, the mole is built of selected materials,
sifted out by the long-continued action of the sea—the work, not of a
few years, but of centuries perhaps. These selections have been made
from a vast deposit of mud, of which they form an exceedingly small
proportion."!

•The grains are smaller than those of Long Island, hut correspond pretty well
with those of Cape Pear.

■
"3d. The once grand entrance of Greytown could not have been
maintained by the San Juan, even if it had been the only avenue of
discharge from the main artery. One has only to divide the discharge
(measured by any of the engineers) into the cross-section of the ship-
channel given upon the old charts, to discover how powerless the sea-
ward flow must have been. From the best computations that I can
make with the data at hand, I find that in 1832 the section of the
entrance to Greytown was seventy limes the area that we have now in the
Lower San Juan at the head of the passes; eighteen times the section of
the main river above the Colorado in dry seasons; and seven times the
section of the main river in ' top gallant flood.'* Even as late as 1853,
the section of the entrance to Greytown Harbor was five time as great
as that of the main river."
The other and undoubtedly correct theory is that the harbor was
closed by a sand spit built by the shifting of the sand under the action
of the waves, which strike the shore at an angle of about 45°.
In 1866 a Committe of the American Academy of Science made a
report on the causes which led to the closing of the harbor, from which
I quote.
"The earliest source of information that we feel warranted in using
is the sketch to be found in Mr. Molina's work upon Costa Rica, which
is based upon a survey by Cieorge Peacock in 1832, and has additions
showing the progress of the sands of Isla Castilla down to 1818.
"In 1832 five fathoms of water could be carried from sea to a point
within the present basin of Greytown Harbor, through an opening
which measures 1| miles from Isla Castilla to the west shore. At that
time the avenue to the sea was without a bar, and the rexular decline of
the bottom along the seaward channel-way gave no indie itions of the
action of scouring forces. There was no depression at the harbor's mouth
and no accumulations beyond that seemed in any way to be a depend-
ency upon the existence of the basin or its outlets. The shallow ground
lying along the coast outside of Isla Castilla, and projecting beyond to
the westward, would seem, upon Mr. Molina's sketch, to be a concomi-
tant or parallel to this island as well as an outwash of the advance.
Subsequent |surveys, however, dissolve this apparent connection and
relation. The embouchure of the Lower San Juan River is found in
this first survey at the head of the anchorage basin, and the deposits of
that stream appear to be nearly two miles within the harbor's mouth.
"Between 1832 and 1834 a movement of the sands to the westward
occurred, which extended the point of Isla Castilla about 456 feet per
annum. This extension took the form of a hook. From 1834 to 1835
the point advanced 608 feet. Four years later, in 1839, it was found to
*Mr. Barnes, a resident at the "Forks" pointed out what he called "top gallant
floods," of which we measured the elevation.


59
have advanced 1,065 feet or at the rate of 266 feet per annum. Between
1839 and 1840 it advanced about 400 feet. Between 1840 and 1848, a space
of nearly eight years, it advanced 221 feet per year, and in the next suc-
ceeding ten months 913 feet were added, or the beach grew at the rate
of nearly 1,100 feet per annum. The harbor as a protection to shipping
had been improving up to the last date upon Mr. Molina's sketch, but
its opening from the sea had become reduced to about 0.8 of a mile, a
loss of over 50 per cent.
"In 1853, we And the mouth of the harbor, measured upon the same
line as before, reduced to 0.52 of a mile, a reduction of 35 per cent since
1848. In this period of four and a half years, the sand-spit made an
average annual advance of 401 feet. The physical character of the
harbor had thus far undergone no change; the same good depth of
water could be carried in; the same gradual decline of the bottom to
seaward was preserved, and no bar or shoal lay in front. The point of
Isla Castilla called on this more recent map, Punta Arenas, had been
made across the flow of the sea by sands thrown in from above, not
scoured from the bottom; it was built out like a mole, the material tak-
ing nearly its natural slope, and not suffering waste under the action of
any currents from within. In this chart of 1853 an opening through the
beach is found about at the extremity of the Castilla of 1832. As a
physical feature it does not yet appear important.
"The survey of 1856 found the dry portion of Point Arenas advan-
ced nearly due south from its position in 1853, and a gradual shoaling-
off to the westward, reducing the harbor's mouth to 0.3 of a mile. At
this time the point was broad and hooked: The same depth of water
could be carried in as formerly, and no bar was found outside.
"Between October 1856 and January 1859, two and a quarter years,
Point Arenas advanced to the southwest 1,156 feet, or at the rate of
about 514 ft. per annum. Even as late as 1859 when the harbor's mouth
was reduced to 0.13 of a mile, the only trace of any action from within
was the retreat of the 18-feet line on the west shore.
"According to a note upon the British chart, the entrance was re-
duced to 300 feet in 1861; while, in January 1865, Captain Jones, of Her
Majesty's ship Shannon, reports that the entrance has a bar across it
after a norther, though after a continuance of fine weather the scour of
the river increases the depth to 8 or 10 feet. The passage on the oppo-
site side is reduced to 50 or 60 yards.
"Our final authority is the survey made under the direction of
Captain P. C. F. West, who brought to the field the skill and accuracy
of long experience in the coast survey, to which corps he now belongs.
"In this survey made in February 1865, the change in the physical
character of the harbor, shadowed forth in the note that we quoted from
the British chart, is confirmed. The anchorage has become a lagoon


The Technic.
with an uncertain inlet. Between Point Arenas and the opposite shore
a depression of 20 feet is found, to reach which 17J feet must be passed
in the approach from the harbor and 8 feet in the approach from the
sea. Here we have the depression at the opening and the bar outside, which
are the characteristics of a true inlet, for which we looked in vain upon
the earlier charts.
"After the completion of the general survey, Captain West's party
found, in May, that the opening at Greytown Harbor had closed, and
that a breach had been made farther to the westward."
Plate III shows the inlet as it existed in 1888.
One needs only to stand on the beach in front of the lagoon and
watch the sand and light drift-wood travel from east to west to become
satisfied that the harbor was closed by a sand spit built by the action of
the waves as set forth above. It is important to keep this in mind, as
the plans for restoration would have to be entirely different if the first
theory was the true one.
After the closing of the harbor the inlet shifted back to the eastward
about three miles, to a point known as Harbor Point. We find now a
typical inlet where the opening is maintained by the action of a river


6i
forcing its waters into the sea. Plate III shows that the once deep
anchorage in the old harbor has become a shallow lagoon.
In regard to the plans for reconstructing the harbor, the report of
the Chief Engineer of the Company, Mr. A. G. Menocal, gives the fol-
lowing:
"The observations and surveys conducted by the Hydrographic
party and subsequent investigations by other engineers of the Company,
have fully confirmed the theory based on previous surveys as to the
nature and magnitude of the forces which caused the destruction of
this harbor and consequently the plan heretofore recommended for
resisting these forces and restoring the harbor, is now adhered to with
but slight modifications in the details.
"The plan of restoration involves the construction of a jetty or
breakwater 1,700 feet long, nearly normal to the shore of the outer bar,
and extending to the six fathom curve, and dredging from this latter
depth off shore across the sand bank now closing the harbor and in the
inner bay. The jetty is located to the windward of the excavated chan-
nel which it is intended to shelter from the sea and protect from the
wash of the waves and the traveling sands of the coast.
"The first section of the jetty extending from the shore to 15 feet
of water is proposed to be built of creosoted timber, fascinage and stone,
and that portion in deep water to be of " pierre perdue" or rubble, the
stone to be obtained from the •' Divide Cut." The entrance channel is
estimated to have a depth of 30 feet and a width of 500 feet at the bot-
tom, and the inner basin is designed of sufficient dimensions to afford
easy access to the canal and to accommodate a large number of vessels,
its excavated area on the bottom being 206 acres, which, with the area
of the enlarged section of the canal at sea level to Lock No. 1, gives a
total area of 341 acres of water 28 feet deep exclusive of slopes of three
to one and the remaining portions of the inner bay not deepened, yet
having in many places a depth of 20 feet in which a large number of
vessels of ordinary size can lie."
breakwater.
The location of the proposed breakwater is shown in on Plate III.
Photograph shows the general plan of construction. It is a timber
structure consisting of pile bents 8 feet apart from center to center.
Each bent consists of, 12 piles, driven in two rows of 6 each, between
which is bolted a cap 14" X 14" X 42'. On top of this cap are longi-
tudinal stringers bolted to the caps and piles. On both sides of the
breakwater the piles are driven as nearly in contact as possible, to act
as a sheeting to retain the filling. The bottom where the piles were
driven is a very compact sand. It required about 400 blows from a
hammer weighing 2,240 lbs, falling from 20 to 40 feet, to drive a pile 20


The Technic.
feet. A water jest was then arranged and no trouble was experienced in
putting piles down from 20 to 30 feet, in from three to five minutes after
turning on .the water. The average cost of driving a large number of
piles including sharpening, etc., was eight cents per foot.
This wooden structure was only intended to answer as a false-work
from which to deposit the rock, brush, etc., of the permanent work. It
was expected that the filling would progress as fast as the piles were
driven. Inability to secure rock prevented this, and at times the piling
was several hundred feet in advance of the filling. At first the filling
consisted of alternate layers of brush mattresses and rock. As soon a9
the piling was filled, the sand accumulated against the windward side
and protected the piles and brush, but on the channel side the teredo
attacked the brush and it soon entirely disappeared. Later no brush
was used on the channel side. All the timber used in the breakwater
was North Carolina pine treated with from 14 to 16 lbs of wood creosote
to the cublic foot. It was expected that this would prevent its being
attacked by the teredo, but within two months some of the piles were
attacked, within six months many were badly eaten, and within one
year some were eaten entirely off. Other piles would not be attacked
at all under a year. All were supposed to have been treated exactly
alike. While some were attacked and others not the writer is unable
to explain.
As rock for filling was not obtainable, and as the teredo were rap-
idly weakening the structure, to prevent its entire destruction it was
decided to fill it with concrete. The concrete consisted of Portland
cement 1 part, beach sand 4 parts. As most of it had to be deposited
under water in a rough sea, it was put into gunny sacks and deposited
before setting. The results were entirely satisfactory.
As the filling in of the breakwater progressed and the supply of
sand was cut off from the channel side, the waves began to cut away
the beach on that side; and when the breakwater had advanced to a
point 380 feet from the shore, the sea cut through the narrow strip of
beach between the sea and the lagoon, opening a channel about 500 feet
wide and A\ feet deep. If the filling of the breakwater was kept some
distance in advance of the beach on the windward side, so that no sand
passed around the end of the pier, the channel showed a tendency to
deepen, but if sand passed around the end, the channel would soon
shoal. •
This opening was caused entirely by the action of the waves, and
was the direct result of the breakwater. The direction of the break-
water is almost due north and south; the waves come in from a north-
east direction and after passing the end of the breakwater the eastern
end of the waves are retarded, the outer ends swing around and when
they reach the shore are moving in a direction nearly parallel to the


BREAKWATER.

shore and toward the breakwater. It was this swinging action which
cut through the beach. It threatened to go farther and cut in behind
the shore end of the breakwater. To prevent this sheet piliing was
driven back toward the lagoon for a distance of 700 feet. This swing-
ing action of the waves will be referred to again later'.
Under the action of the strong current flowing out from the lagoon,
this channel soon deepened, so that in October 1890, there was 5J feet of
water at low tide. In October a dredge was put at work to deepen the
channel from the lagoon to deep water outside the bar. At first a
channel 150 feet wide with 12 feet of water was cut, this was afterward
deepened to 17 feet.
The swinging action of the waves mentioned above now began to
play an important part, for no sooner was the channel opened than this
action of the waves began to bring the sand from the west side of the
channel and built a point, which under the combined action of the cur-
rent from the lagoon and the waves, took a direction somewhat north
of east across the newly dug channel. By changing the direction of
current from the lagoon these forces were brought more in opposition
to each other and the deposit of sand forced to take a more northerly
direction and thus interfere with the channel in a less degree. But in
spite of anything which could be done at the time a dredge had to be
put at work on this point at frequent intervals to maintain a channel.
In order to break up this swinging action of the waves, another break-
water was started on the west side of the entrance, and about 500 feet
distant from breakwater No. 1. This seemed to have a beneficial effect,
but, as it was never filled, the benefit expected was not fully-realized.
This breakwater in turn set up the same action of the waves to the west-
ward of it, and eventually the sea cut in behind it and it was left "high
and dry" at sea. Lack of such and a still greater lack of money pre-
vented any permanent good being secured from this attempt. In the
opinion of the writer a breakwater will have to be constructed on the
west side of the entrance and the beach protected for some distance to
the west by groins or other means.
In the early part of 1893 the space to the windward of the break-
water, where there had been water from 6 to 12 feet deep, had filled in
with sand, to a height of about 6 feet above tide, to the extreme end of
the breakwater. In other words there had been an area of dry land
added to the beach of a triangular shape with a base of about a third of
a mile, and an attitude of 937 feet. The average depth of this fulling
was about 15 feet, showing an accumulation of about 4,400,000 cubic
yards in the portion above water in three years. The trend of the shore
at this time was not Parallel to the old beach, the end near the break-
water having advanced faster than the east end, thus making the beach
more nearly normal to the direction of the waves than formerly.


The results so far have seemed to show that the harbor can be re-
constructed on substantially the plans proposed. How far the break-
water will have to be prolonged seaward to render the beach to the east
stable, no one can tell. A study of the problem on the ground for sev-
eral years leads the writer to believe that the same forces which pro-
duced the original mole enclosing Greytown Harbor, are now at work
with a tendency to enclose another area entirely outside the present
beach line. When last seen by the writer in August 1893, there appeared
to be a new spit starting from the point of land about 1J miles to the
eastward of the breakwater. Should this prove to be true it might be
advisable to build another breakwater at this point to cut off the travel
of the sand from the eastward, as deep water can be reached here at a
less distance, and the direction of the shore line to the eastward is more
nearly normal to the waves.
The water of the San Juan River carries a large amount of sedi-
ment, and if allowed an outlet to the sea through the harbor entrance,
it is only a question of time when a bar will be formed. To prevent
this the river must be entirely cut off from the harbor. This can be
done either by building an embankment across the Greytown lagoon,
or by deflecting the waters of the lower San Juan into the Colorado at
the head of the Passes. If this latter were done, there would still be the
water from a drainage area of about 140 square miles brought down by
the San Juanillo, which would pass out through the harbor entrance-
It would undoubtedly be better to adopt both measures.
When once the breakwater is completed, it is proposed to dredge the
entrance and a sufficient area for anchorage purposes to a depth of 30
feet.
THE WORK ACCOMPLISHED.
The surveys of the regions between Greytown and Ochoa, and
between the lake and Brito have been unusually detailed and thorough.
These surveys include not only the adopted line of the canal, the rail-
road, and water works, but another proposed canal from Ochoa to
Greytown following the river, also the Divides to be crossed, and the
hills including the valleys to be flooded. These have all been platted
on a scale of 400 feet to an inch with ten foot contours. Anyone who
has never been in a tropical forest does not realize the amount of work
required on such surveys. Owing to the dense growth of underbush
no topography could be taken by sketching. Everything had to be
determined by instrumental surveys.
Following the surveys was the construction of sixty-five miles of
telegraph line to connect with the government wires at Castillo, thus
getting communication with the outside world. Offices, quarters for
officers, storehouses and a hospital, all on a sufficient scale for a force


66
of about 1500 laborers were constructed. These are all plain, but com-
fortable wooden buildings. The construction of ten miles of railroad
has been mentioned. At its eastern terminus a small but complete ma-
chine shop was established with appliances for hauling out and repair-
ing light draught steamers, lighters, etc. For a distance of 18 miles the
canal cut was chopped, and for a distance of nine miles entirely cleared.
At the Greytown end a small amount of dredging was done in the
entrance to the canal.
It may seem that this is a small showing for the time expended,
but it must .be borne in mind that during all this time, there was no
entrance to Greytown Harbor for ocean steamers. All supplies, mate-
rials, machinery, etc., had to be transferred from steamers to lighters at
open sea, in an entirely unprotected situation. It is no easy matter,
nor is it unattended with risk, to hoist locomotives, steam shovels, flat
cars, etc, over the side of a vessel and land them in lighters, when both
ship and lighter are rolling and pitching in a heavy sea.
Owing to the financial difficulties of the company practically no
new work has been done since the early part of 1891. The work thus
far has been nearly all of a preliminary nature, but none the less
necessary.
HEALTHFULNESS AND CLIMATE.
Theimpression has generally prevailed that all tropical America is a
hotrbed of malarial to be shunned as one would a pest-house. An expe-
rience of five years in Nicaragua has amply demonstrated the health-
fulness at this point. In working a force of 1,000 men in the swamp
immediately back from the coast, for several months, the hospital
records show that on an average each man would go to the hospital
once a year, and that the average time of treatment was about five days.
The total deaths from all causes was lr8ff per cent, of those admitted to
the hospital. The deaths due to the climatic diseases was only T7ff of
1 per cent. In making the surveys the engineering parties for months
at a time worked in pouring rains, wading swamps and streams, in fact
were always wet to the skin during the day, and at night slept in tem-
porary shakes thatched with palm leaves, and entirely open on the sides,
yet all were perfectly healthy. Such exposure could not be endured at
all in our northern climate.
The healthfulness of this region is, without doubt, largely due to
the exceedingly equable temperature, and the presence of the north-
east trade winds which prevail at this point throughout the entire year.
Sweeping across the country as they do, they carry away and dissipate
the malaria, making a moderate and healthful climate of what would
otherwise be an almost uninhabitable region.


The Technic.
The climatic conditions on the Atlantic and Pacific slopes are
entirly different. On the east side it is liable to rain at any time during
the year, there being no well defined dry season. On the west side the
rainy season lasts from about May to December, and the dry from De-
cember to May. On the Atlantic coast the annual rainfall varies from
150 inches to more than 300 inches. The range of temperature is from
71° to 92°. The average midday temperature is about 87°, and the tem-
perature at night about 75°. Taken in connection with the trade winds
these temperatures are not at all oppressive. On the western slope the
temperature is slightly higher during the dry season. Dr. Earl Flint of
Kivas, who has for many years kept a meteorological record, supplies
the following data;—average rainfall 62 inches, with a maximum of 91
inches and a minimum of 32 inches.
ESTIMATE COST OF THE WORK.
The estimate of the Chief Engineer is given in Appendix A.
In the early part of 1889 the company submitted their notes and
plans to a board of consulting engineers, composed of the following
gentlemen:
Mr. John Bogent, M. Am. Soc. C. E., State Eng., State of New York.
Mr. E. D. T. Meyers, M. Am. Soc. C. E.
Mr. A. M. Wellington, M. Am. Soc. C. E., Editor Engineering News,
New York.
Mr. H. A. Hitchcock, Professor of Engineering, Dartmouth College.
Mr. Charles T. Harvey, former Chief Engineer, St. Mary's Fall
Locks.
This Board increased ihe total estimate to $87,779,570. It is with
some hesitation that the writer ventures to set his opinions against the
distinguished engineers above mentioned, but a more thorough ac-
quaintance with the physical conditions under which the work must
be carried out, as well as later and more complete data leads him to
believe that the estimate ought to be increased to $100,000,000. That it
would be a paying investment at that cost, there can be but little doubt.
Space will not permit that branch of the subject, nor the advantages to
be derived to be taken up in this paper.
ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER ROUTES.
As compared to other proposed routes this possesses the following
advantages:
1st. It is located in a healthy region.
2d. None of the so-called sea-land routes have yet been shown to
he practicable at any reasonable cost.
3d. Of canals with locks, this is the only one possessing a natural
and adequate water supply for the summit level.


4th. It is the only route which would be available for sailing ves-
sels at all seasons of the year, as all the other routes have one or both
their termini within the regions of the equatorial columns which pre-
vail at certain seasons.
5th. It is the route farthest north, and therefore more nearly in
the line of trade. This is a matter of no small importance to commer-
cial interests, and to the government of the United States, it is all
important as affording the shortest highway for her navy between the
two oceans.

CHAKLKS E. GREENE, A M., C.E.
The amount of the annual precipitation of water and its distribution
throughout the year are studied by the hydraulic engineer from different
points of view. If he is projecting a plan for sewerage and drainage he
cares more for maximum values; if for water supply, he is concerned about
the minimum annual rainfall and the duration of summer droughts.
I have collected some statistics in regard to the rainfall in Michigan,
and in Ann Arbor particularly, and present them here in comparison with
the consumption of water as shown by the records of the Ann Arbor
water-works. A few moments' study of the figures will, I hope, prove
interesting.

Average Rainfall in Ann Arbor, 1881-94 — 14 yrs. = 31.5 Inches.
Annual Rainfall in Michigan
Annual Rainfall in Ann Arbor
The accompanying diagram shows, by the full line, the average annual
rainfall of the State of Michigan, for the years 1877 to 1890 inclusive, as
given in the reports of the State Board of Health. The data are from
reports of seventeen to twenty stations, scattered pretty well over the
State, and including some in the upper Peninsula. Those familiar with
rainfall figures will notice that Michigan, although surrounded by the
great lakes, has but a moderate average annual rainfall. It will also
appear that the steady decline in the line from 1883 to 1890 is sufficient to
cause the low water stage in the lakes complained of in recent years. The


77
average rainfall for the fourteen years is 35.4 inches; the maximum was
43.21 inches in 1881; and the minimum was 28.18 inches in 1889.
The average rainfall in Massachusetts, or, more correctly, on the
watershed of the Boston water-works, is reported at 48 inches, about 33
per cent more than for Michigan. The rainfall diminishes as one goes
west.
The broken line shows the annual precipitation, rain and melted snow,
in Ann Arbor, as reported from the University observatory. It will be
noticed that this broken line runs below, and in most cases materially
below, that of the average for the State. The year 1890 was an exception;
and. when the State reports are published for 1893, that year may also
prove exceptional. The average for the fourteen years shown, 1881 to 1894
inclusive, is 31.5 inches. The strong contrast between the year 1893 and
the following year is noticeable, the rainfall for 1893 being 38.43 inches,
almost the maximum amount for the years here shown; and that for 1894
is 24.96 inches, practically a minimum amount. Such a minimum must be
borne in mind by any careful water-works projector.
I incline to the opinion that the rainfall in Southern Michigan is less
than the amount for the northern part of the State, and that calculations
for water-works in this section should be based on an average and mini-
mum less than those shown by the full line in the diagram.
The yield from a watershed, as obtained from the run-off, or from
underground supply, depends not only upon the annual precipitation, but
also upon the distribution of the rainfall throughout the- year. The
amount that can be collected from the surface of the ground or from
streams, and also the amount which percolates through the ground and
can be pumped from wells is affected very differently by the time of year
and state of the surface of the ground when the precipitation occurs.
Again, in the case of cities where lawns are frequent and the use, or abuse,
of garden hose is not kept in check, the consumption of water in the sum-
mer months varies inversely with the rainfall. The water waste in severe
winter weather is an independent matter, but must be taken account of in
providing for a sufficient supply.
The annexed table gives the rainfall for Ann Arbor, by months from
1889 to 1894 inclusive. The division by months is of course somewhat
arbitrary, as the difference of a day or two in the occurrence of a rain
might change the figures in two successive months. The two years, 1889
and 1894, of scanty rainfall are included, but the average does not differ
much from that for fourteen years. In 1889, it will be noticed, the preci-
pitation was very scanty for the first four months, in May and June it was
abundant, in July moderate, and for the rest of the year, until November
and December, scanty. The distribution was different in 1894. The year
was comparatively dry until May; there was little rain in June, less in
-


The Technic.
July and none in August. Indeed for several weeks, practically for two
months, there was no rain to speak of. The rain in September with diffi-
culty made the grass green again, and the year closed comparatively dry.
The storage capacity required for water-works depending on the run-
off from the watershed would be very great in such a year. Most of the
smaller water-works in Michigan derive their supply from driven or other
wells and are not immediately affected by monthly fluctuations in rainfall;
but successive years of constantly decreasing precipitation, such as appear
on the diagram, are likely to have a very serious influence.

I have placed on the two sides of the above table, for convenient &lt;om-
parison with the monthly rainfall, some figures showing the water pumped
each month by the Ann Arbor water-works, as taken from counter read-
ings on the pumps, for the years 1889, 1890 and 1894. The data for some
of the intermediate years are not entirely trustworthy.
The population of Ann Arbor, during the time under consideration,
may be taken at from 9,000 to 11,000, or for an average 10,000. It is almost
exclusively a residence city, there being but little manufacturing carried
on. The water is collected from springs and flowing, driven wells, and
pumped to a reservoir of two million gallons capacity; it flows thence to
the city by gravity, giving a pressure in the business portion of from GO to


79
70 pounds, and in the more elevated residence portion of some 40 to 45
pounds. The works were built in 1885. In 1886 the number of taps had
reached 775. In 1887 they increased from 775 to 880; in 1888 to 940; in
1889 to 1,070; in 1890 to 1,150, deductions being made for taps shut off; and
for the year 1894 the taps in use amounted to from 1,350 to 1,400. In addi-
tion to these, there were in 1894 a few water motors, some four or five
hydraulic elevators, and the University buildings and hospitals, large con-
sumers of water and added subsequent to 1890.
We may see by inspection of the figures, the increase in the demand
for water during the summer months, when garden hose was brought into
use; the influence of the amount of rainfall on the demand in such months;
the growth in the consumption from year to year, and the increased
amount used per tap or per consumer, as the works are longer in use.
Counting on 10,000 people in 1894, and a monthly consumption of 25 mil-
lion gallons, when garden hose are not in use, we find a supply of a little
over 80 gallons per 'capita, with a maximum demand of 160 gallons in
August, when there was no rain.
The anomalous figures given for June, 1889, are accounted for by the
fact that a new pump was being connected, and at two periods, ten days
in all, no water was pumped. The decrease in the amount pumped in the
latter part of 1894 is due to more careful management and inspection.
Winter waste is not apparent from the figures and is not large, I feel sure.

The daily irregularity in the consumption of water is shown more
plainly in the earlier years than when large consumers have been added.
The record for May, 1889, is given here to show the fluctuations, as
influenced by rainy days and by the use of hose as soon as warm weather
sets in. These fluctuations are rendered less apparent, than they would
be in the case of a direct supply, by the addition of the two million gallon


The Technic.
reservoir. The draft on the reservoir is likely to be made good a little
later. After the rains and the cool weather at the close of the month, the
decreased consumption of water afforded a favorable opportunity for con-
necting the new pump.
Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald, of the Boston water-works, reports that, in
the dryest years, the amount of water running off their watershed, and
collected in the receiving basin, was about one-third of the total precipita-
tion. The amount that can be stored is affected very much by different
circumstances that I will not stop to discuss here. I am inclined to think
that the amount of water to be obtained from underground sources, in
times following years of scanty rainfall, ought not to be reckoned at more
than 33 per cent, of that rainfall. Underground supplies are not at once
affected by droughts, and a large proportion of a heavy rain, especially in
the early spring, may run off and not feed the underground basins to any
extent. But a succession of years of diminishing rainfall will tell severely
on the ground water level.
If then one can calculate on but from 24 to 28 inches rainfall as a
minimum, and on only 33 per cent, of that for the yield of either streams
or wells, how much watershed is necessary for the supply of a town of
10,000 people, with sixty gallons of water per inhabitant? The figures can
be readily altered for other quantities.
One inch of water on a square mile will be about 17,400,000 gallons;
and this amount, if used during the year, will be 1,450,000 gallons per
month of 47,700 gallons per day. Therefore to make the amount of 600,000
gallons per day will call for 12% inches of water, an amount in excess of
what can be derived from the rainfall of the dryest year, but which might
be expected from years above the average. The area of watershed required
to furnish 600,000 gallons per day ought then to exceed one square mile
quite materially in Michigan, whether the water is taken from streams or
from subterranean sources, and an estimate of one and a half to two square
miles will not be large for 10,000 people, unless the water consumption is
held well in check.
I think there are no works in Michigan where any large amount of
storage capacity is provided.

DYNAMO DESIGN.
H. B. KING. CLASS OF '94.
There is such an innovation in the process of economizing floor
space that its careful consideration has led both the mechanical and
electrical engineer to perfect their product in order that they may suc-
cessfully get maximum power out of minimum floor space. This desire
to economize in floor space has caused the generator to be directly con-
nected to its prime mover. By using a high speed multiple cylinder
engine having the generator directly coupled to the engine shaft as high
■as ten horse power has been developed for every square foot of floor
space occupied by the engine and generator. This feature is of the
utmost importance where real estate is high or floor space at a premium
as in large cities or upon board ship. ,
Given a well designed high speed multiple cylinder engine, let us
•consider some of the features of a generator which is to be directly
coupled to this prime mover. By referring to the well known formula
for the voltage of a generator it is seen that the voltage is directly pro-
portional to three factors; the total number of lines of force flowing
through the armature, the number of conductors upon the periphery of
the armature and the revolutions per second of the armature. These
three factors multiplied together and this product divided by ten raised
to the eight power will equal the voltage developed in any given arma-
ture. If by any means any one of these factors be increased, other
things being equal, an increase in the output of the armature will be
the result. A limit to the increase in speed of the generator is neces-
sarily the limit to the increase in speed of the prime mover. This is
soon reached, the speed of the prime mover varying from 200 to 500
depending upon its size. As the speed of belted generators is much in
excess of this, it is apparent that an entirely different design of a gener-
ator must be used in direct-connected work than is used in belted work.
At first glance, it might be supposed that the output of any armature
could be increased by increasing the number of conductors upon the
armature. Let us see what effect such an increase would have.
A properly designed constant potential dynamo should have a con-
stant lead to the brushes. In other words there should be no change of
the point of commutation from full load to no load. To accomplish
-this result the armature reaction must be as small as possible. As this


The Technic.
is directly proportional to the ampere turns upon the armature, for a
given output any increase beyond a certain limit in the number of con-
ductors upon the armature would result in sparking. I have seen two-
110 volt belted machines of the same type, one of 50 amperes capacity
and the other of 300 amperes capacity. The former had 124 conductors
upon its armature, the latter 108 conductors. The 50 ampere machine
would run without any sparking. The entire load could be thrown off
or on and would not be perceived at the commutator. In fact the
machine was perfect. On the other hand the 300 ampere machine could
not be made to run without sparking, unless by constantly changing the
lead of the brushes. The brushes once adjusted for no sparking the
least variation in the load would throw them out of adjustment. The
first machine could probably have had a greater number of conductors
while the second machine had entirely too many. It is very evident the
designer did not pay sufficient attention to the armature effects. In
addition to the above it must be borne in mind that for any armature to
run without sparking there must be a proper reluctance of the air-gap.
The length of the air-gap must be such that the amp ere turns in the
field—necessary to produce that flow of lines of force through the
armature which will give the required pressure in the armature—shall
always be greater than the ampere turns on the armature at any par-
ticular load. It is evident from what has been said that there is a limit
to an increase in the number of conductors upon any armature.
In order to secure the desired result, namely a low speed generator,
the only remaining factor to be increased is the number of lines of
force cut in any given time. This increase can be very easily produced
by increasing the number of pairs of poles under which the conductors
are to pass. If the poles are increased to four we will have an arrange-
ment which may be considered as a combination at right angles of two
bipolar dynamo frames, with the polarity of the opposite poles the same.
The conductors cut in one revolution twice as many lines of force as
they would in the bipolar machine provided that the number of lines
of force per pole is the same in both cases. By increasing the number
of pairs of poles any desired voltage can be obtained for low speed.
Theoretically there is no limit to this increase, practically this limit
varies from eight to twelve poles. So it is seen that a generator directly
connected to its prime mover should be of the multipolar type.
The most important part of a generator is the armature. An arma-
ture for a multipolar generator may be wound in several ways depending
upon the results desired. There are two methods by which both gramme
and drum armatures may be wound. In one the current takes two paths
through the armature. In the other the current takes as many paths as
there are poles. In the former the advantage of the multipolar feature
is in the reduction of the number of conductors; in the latter, in the-


83
reduction of the size of the wire on the armature and of the brush
area. This last point is of great importance in generators having a
large ampere capacity as the commutator cost would otherwise be great.
The armature reaction remains the same in both forms of winding.
Take up the various forms of gramme ring winding. Consider only
the two cases (1) when two brushes are used, (2) when as many brushes
are used as there are poles. Under the first the most common connec-
tion is what is sometimes called the N + 1 wind. The connections are
shown in figure 1. There must be a certain number of sections or the
winding will not come out properly. To get the number of sections in
the armature use the formula N = PS ±*1; P, the number of pairs of
poles and S, the skip which must always be an odd number. In figure 1 N
is 7, P is 2 and S is 3. Theconstant± I is introduced in order that N may
always be an odd number which is absolutely necessary. A few trials
with N as an even number will make this evident. In the second case
there are as many brushes as there are poles and therefore for a given
armature the conductors are of less area than in the first instance but
are greater in number. The connections in this case are shown in figure
Fig. 1. Fig. 2.
2. Here the number of sections in the armature should be divisible by
the number of poles. This winding is not used very much. As a mat-
ter-of-fact the gramme ring is becoming obsolete. A generator with a
gramme ring armature is now looked upon as behind the times.
The drum armature is used almost without exception in tirst-class
multipolar machines. In the winding cf the drum armature for multi-
polar machines many different windings are met, only two of which are
here considered. We have in this instance, as in the ring armature, the
two general cases, one having two brushes, the other having as many
brushes as there are poles. The diagram of the winding of the second


The Technic.
case is shown in figure 3. In this case the number of sections should be
divisible by the number of poles. The skip should be a little less than
the pitch of the poles on the back of the armature and on the front less
than the back, when this winding is used the armature must be in per-
fect electric balance and the effect of each field on the armature should
Fig. 3. Fig. 4.
be the same. If the above is not carefully attended to the result will be
a generator that will spark.
In case one, the winding is shown in figure 4. Here the formula
JN = P Y ± 2 is used, P is the number of poles, Fis the skip which must
Fig. 5.


85
always be an odd number. The constant ± 2 is introduced for the same
reason that the constant ± 1 is introduced in the ring winding. There
are a great many other windings which accomplish the same purpose as
here indicated. Some of these have points of great value for various
classes of work. The windings that are given in this article are the most
common.
In figure 5 is shown a modern direct connected set. The engine is
of the high speed type, the revolutions being 300 per minute with a
stroke of 12 inches. The generator is a six pole multipolar type having
six brushes.
This generator, like most all first class generators of the present, has
a slotted armature. The conductors thus embedded in the armature are
insulated from it and from each other in a much more thorough man-
ner than could be accomplished if the conductors were on the peri-
phery.

CENTRAL HEATING PLANT OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN.
WM. H. DORRANCE, JR., B 8. '03.
The rapid growth of our University within the last few years has been
the subject of much conversation and the cause of much rejoicing among
•the friends of our Alma .Mater, as well as among her family and immediate
relatives.
But those who have the management of the household in charge, have
also had graver thoughts to occupy their attention. Many perplexing
questions have arisen at too frequent intervals. The corps of instructors
must of necessity be increased, and likewise, the facilities for instruction,
especially in the laboratories. Our Engineering departments are still
«adly hampered in this respect. But one difficulty leads to another.
More teachers, more facilities, more room, more buildings, is the geometri-
cal progression.
Not the least of the problems which have called for a solution within
the last year, was that of the economical heating of the various buildings.
Previous to the erection of the first Boiler House (No. 1) in the rear of
University Hall, each building contained its own heating plant. This
method soon became inadequate to the needs of the University, and it was
necessary to resort to some better plan.
On July 24th, 1879, the contract for a steam heating apparatus was
awarded to the Detroit Metal and Plumping Works for $9,606, also for a
Boiler House and stack to Dean Bros, of Detroit for $4,369. The plant
was completed during October, 1880, at a totol cost of $19,898.01. It fur-
nished steam to the Law building,'Main building, Museum, Homeopathic
Hospital, University Hospital, and later the Library. The plant contained
four horizontal tubular boilers, each Ave feet in diameter and 14 feet in
length, rated at 65 H. P. each, making a total of 260 H. Ps. These were
set in one battery.
The Legislature of 1883 made an appropriation, by means of which
two additional boilers were purchased. The original boiler settings were
overhauled, the furnaces enlarged, and new grates substituted, all of
which resulted in a great improvement in the operation of the plant.
A 6 inch main and 4 inch return were put into the Museum, which
previously had received its supply from the pipe to the Main Building. A

pump room was also built below ground to admit of placing the pump
below a receiving tank into which the drips from the various buildings
were discharged through traps. It was necessary to carry 20 to 40 pounds
pressure in this plant. These improvements were executed by Engineer
R. P. Sanford under the supervision and from the plans of Prof. M. E. *
Cooley. The size of the boiler room was 38 X 58 X 18 feet clear height.
The octagonal chimney was 80 feet high and four feet inside diameter.
The building of the various laborato ies in the opposite corner of the
campus compelled a new and more complete arrangement. In the sum-
mer and fall of 1887, a new Boiler House (No. 2) was erected in the south-
east part of the grounds south of the Medical College. It contained four
horizontal tubular boilers, each five feet in diameter and 14 feet long, set
in two batteries of two boilers each. These boilers were rated at 65 H. Ps.
each. After two years or in 1889. two Heine Safety Boilers,* of 150 H. P.
each, were installed, making a total of 560 U. Ps. in the building. The
boiler room was 39 X 62 X 24 feet clear height, and the floor was 14% feet
below ground. At this time steam heating was put into the Medical
building, Anatomical Laboratory, and Physical and Hygienic Laboratory
from plans of Prof. &lt; ooley.

The Technic.
The pipes running underground from the two Boiler Houses to the-
different buildings were encased in a box, the walls of which were two
inches thick, coated on the outside with a mixture of asphaltum and a
little tar. The steam pipe itself was first wrapped with one thickness of
asbestos paper and then one inch of hair felt, and one thickness of build-
ing paper all wound with copper wire.
During the spring of 1894, in view of the addition of the Gymnasium,
the Recitation Building and the Engineering College to the campus build-
ings, and the need of an electric lighting plant, a new heating system was
discussed. The opinions were unanimous that to have one central Boiler
House was the best plan. But upon the manner of distribution of the
steam to the various buildings there was much argument. The use of
high pressure steam in pipes running through logs to the buildings was
advocated. But by reason of the fact that, in the event of the installation
of an electric light plant, it would be advantageous to use the exhaust for
heating, thus necessitating the use of large pipes, which would increase
the expense of the log system very rapidly, it was finally decided to make
the circuit of the campus with a duct and use low pressure and large
pipes.
Bids were received from four firms, each submitting their own plans.
The Walworth Construction Co. of Boston, Mass., and the A. Harvey's
Sons Mnfg. Co. Ltd. of Detroit, Mich., each bid upon a system using logs
and high psessure.
Bids were submitted by Shaw, Kendall &amp; Co. of Toledo, Ohio, and the
John Davis Co. of Chicago, 111., upon the system of low pressure, large
pipes, gravity returns, and tunnels. The contract was awarded to A.
Harvey's Sons Co.* on the plan adopted, of tunnels, large pipes and low
pressure.
Work on the excavation and razing the old Boiler House, No. 2, was
commenced the second week in July. The six boilers were left standing
in their old positions and later on, after having been put into good repair,
the six old ones from boiler house No. 1 were brought over and reset. Two
new boilers built by the Erie City Iron Works Co. were also put in place.
Provision was made not only for the heating of the buildings now on
the campus, but also for six new buildings in the future and an enlarge-
ment of the present Library by 50%, Museum by 100%, Engineering Lab-
oratory by 100%, and the Anatomical Laboratory by 100%.
The horse-shoe shaped duct which is 6 feet 6 inches high and 5 feet t&gt;
inches wide with concrete floor, has an 8-inch brick wall with a coating
outside of one inch of cement painted over the arch with asphaltum and
tar. It is 3 feet 6 inches under ground and extends from the north side of
the Boiler House, northward, under the Medical Building, to a point

southwest of the Gymnasium, thence westward under the Dental and
Pathological Laboratories to the corner of the Law Building and then
south to the Main Building.
From the west side of the Boiler House, the south duct passes west-
ward between the Laboratories and the Library and taking two 45° turns
back of the Museum joins the one from the north under the Main Build-
ing. This duct contains the steam and return mains, and water pipes and
will when the electric plant is installed, carry the electric mains.

The various thumb rules that are given for calculating a system of
steam heating are very largely deduced from individual practice and gen-
erally require a large experience for a reliable application. For the young
engineer, a study of the rules given in Box's Practical Treatise on Heat
will be found of great value.

Assume the air in the basement to be changed every half hour, thus
requiring 2 X 55024 = 110,048 cubic feet of air to be heated per hour.
On the first floor, the lecture room seats 125 persons. If we allow 800
cubic feet of air per hour for each person, this would require 100,000 cubic
feet of air to be heated per hour. Inasmuch as the rest of the floor is
used as laboratory by only a few persons at a time, we may assume that
the air be changed only once an hour, and hence requiring 43305 cubic
feet of air to be heated per hour.
On the second floor is situated the Hygienic Laboratory. The nature
of the experiments, made there necessitates a frequent change of air.
Assume it to be changed once every ten minutos.
6 X 60715 = 364290 cubic feet heated per hour making a total, for the-
building, of 617,643 cubic feet of air to be raised from —10° to 90" every

The exhaust steam from the engines is to be used for heating. Hence
the pressure of steam should not be more than five pounds, and the tem-
perature will be 228°. Assuming the temperature of the water of conden-
sation as it returns to the boiler to be 200°, the required number of heat
units to convert one pound of water into steam at Ave pounds would be,
180.6 + 906 + 0.305 (s2S — 212) — (200 — 33-) or 983.5 B. T. U.


The same number of heat units will be given up by the condensation
of the steam in the radiators. Hence the number of pounds of steam

required by the Physical Laboratory per hour will be '^ - = 1603.2
pounds.
To find the amount of radiating surface for the building. Assume
one square foot of indirect surface to give off 600 heat units in one hour.
The amount of indirect surface will be J ^ - = 1797.9 sq. ft.
If the air comes into the room from the indirect radiators at 90° and
leaves at 70°, each pound will give up
0.238 X 20 - 4.T6 B. T. U. and
46,323 lbs. will give up 220,497 B. T. U.
The number of heat units needed for direct
radiation was found to be, 498,092 B. T. U.
From this take the number supplied by indirect
radiation, 220,497 B. T. U.
Leaving to be supplied by direct surface, 277,595 B. T. U.
Assume that each square foot of cast iron direct surface radiates 250
277 595
B. T. U. per hour. Then the amount of direct surface will be ggg =
1110 sq. ft.
Thus we have found for requirements.
Amount of steam per hour, 1603.2 lbs.
Amount of direct surface, 1110. sq. ft.
Amount of indirect surface, 1798. sq. ft.
In order to show the results obtained by the use of the thumb rules
let us take the case of the Pathological Laboratory.
Cubic contents = 143,950 cu. ft.
Outside wall surface = 10,166 sq. ft.
Window surface = 1924. sq. ft.
One rule is as follows:
"Divide the cubic contents by 150 for direct radiation and by 100 for
indirect radiation."
1-T5ir = 960 sq. ft. direct.
, 143,950 ,... ,
and '■ = 1440 sq. ft. indirect.

Baldwin's Rule is stated thus;—
"Divide the difference between the temderature in the building and

The computed consumption of steam per hour for all the buildings,
present and future, is 42,644 lbs., of which the north side of the Campus
consumes 22,476 lbs. and the south side 20,168 lbs. The specifications-
state that the mains shall be large enough to supply steam for thoroughly
heating and ventilating all the present and future buildings on the cam-
pus with a pressure not to exceed rive lbs. per square inch in the boilers in
the coldest weather.
Starting with five lbs. at the Boiler House and a 12-inch main in the
south duct, 336 lbs. must be carried each minute as far as the pipe to the
Engineering Laboratory or 150 feet. A 12-inch main 240 diameters in
length will carry 562 lbs. of steam with one lb. drop ill pressure, (See
D. K. Clark's Handbook.

puted with the results shown in Tables 4 and 5.

These two last tables apply to the plant as originally designed to be
put in, some departures from specifications having been made.


The Main Building has the lowest ground floor, the basement ceiling
and the grade at the Boiler House being about on the same level. The
bottoms of the indirect radiators are three feet under the ceiling. The
fall of pressure of one lb. between the Boiler House and Main Building
corresponds to a head of 2.25 feet, with water at 200°. The water level of
the boilers is eight feet above the floor, hence the floor of the Boiler House
must be 3 + 2.25 + 8 = 13.25 feet below grade. It was made 14.5 feet to
insure perfect circulation.
Where the tunnels do not pass under the building the branch connec-
tions are encased in a patent casing. This casing consists of a vitrified
glazed crock, having iron rings which form a non-circulating air space to
be packed with mineral wool. This glazed crock is placed inside a wooden
pipe which is three and four inches thick and perfectly air and water tight
and coated on the outside with tar.
The returns are connected in the Boiler room with a receiving tank
which may also be used as a heater, so the water may gravitate to the
tank or be pumped directly into the boilers without going through the
tank.
The mains are run across pipe supports, in the ducts, upon a simple
form of gas-pipe roller to allow expansion. At each branch connection an
expansion joint suitably anchored, is put in, the branch connection lead-
ing out of the top of the joint. In most cases sweep fittings are used to
reduce friction.
All mains in the Boiler House and tunnels are covered, the work hav-
ing been done by the Chicago Fire-Proof Covering Co.,* with their Cham-
pion Mineral Wool, varying in thickness from one and one-half to two
inches. The covering is painted with a coat of sizing and a coat of fire and
water-proof paint.
A short computation will show the value of a pipe-covering. We will
consider only the low pressure heating mains and returns in the tunnels.
Assume the temperature in the duct to be 90° = T. This is somewhat
low but owing to the fact that the ends of the tunnels are open and there
is a strong draft through them, the temperature is taken at 90° for this
computation. Assume t = 216° = temperature of steam. Assume tem-
perature of water of condensation to be 200°.

The new 100 H. P. high pressure boilers were built in accordance with
the specifications of the Hartford Steam Boiler'Inspection and Insurance
Co.* The smoke Hues from the four boilers on the west side of the build-
ing go underground to the opposite side and rise into the flue from the-
other boilers on the outside of the building, thence into the chimney.
The chimney is 150 feet high above the grade with a flue diameter of
eight feet. The foundation, which rests on a bed of concrete 24 feet square
and 2 feet thick, is 22 feet 9 inches square at the bottom and 14 feet 6
inches high to grade and consists of stone laid in cement mortar. The
base is octagonal, faced for the first ten feet above grade with Berea sand
stand, which is also the finish of the Boiler House. Prom this point
springs the round shaft of brick with a straight batter of one-fourth of an
inch to the foot. The top is covered with suitable castings. The core
extends to the height of 83 feet and is lined with fire-brick to the height,
of 25 feet.
The plant was ready for operation by the first week in October.
While, in certain of the buildings, the circulation has been imperfect and.
various other changes have been found to be necessary, it may be con-
sidered to be a substantial improvement on former methods.

MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES.
The Launhardt-Weyrauch Method of Dimensioning.
The fact that alternating or vibratory stresses are more injurious
to iron and steel, as well as other materials, than static stresses, was
recognized and provided for by American Engineers a number of years
before European Engineers took any notice of it. The publication of
Wohler's experiments in 1870 aroused a great deal of interest in both
countries, and the investigation which followed resulted in the formulae
advanced by Launhardtand Weyrauch. In these formulae they attempt
to take account of the effects of variation of stress by rational methods,
introducing as few empirical constants as possible.
The American Engineers, on the other hand, attempted to guard
against the same effect by reducing the unit stresses in certain members,
the amount of reduction depending upon the experience and judg-
ment of the individual.
This resulted in a wide variation in practice, which could not fail to
place the profession before the public in an unfavorable light.
The formula of Launhardt is,
where
I = rupturing stress for one application,
u — rupturing stress for infinite number of variations o to u.
s = rupturing stress for infinite number of variations, + » to — ».
B and B' are total loads upon the member and B is numerically
the greater,
a = rupturing stress for infinite number of variations, min B to
max B, or max B' to max B.
These formulae agree with the assumptions at the limiting values,
for when min B or max B' becomes zero, a = it; when min B = max B,
a = i; and when max B' — max B, a = s. If we represent these form-
ulae graphically, using for abscissae the ratios
( — u min B
u max B
■while that of Weyrauch is,
min B -s- max B and max B' -+- max B,


101
and for ordinates the corresponding values of a, the locus is a right line
in each case.
The constants which are used in these formulae vary with the mate-
rial. For wrought iron Weyrauch uses
2 « = m = J t = 10000 pounds
which gives the following form:
'.=10.000(1+»^5)
This gives a safe stress of 15,000 pounds under a static load, and
5,000 pounds for equal stress alternately in tension and compression.
As good iron has an elastic limit of 26,000 pounds, these values are
well within the limits of good practice, impact being left out of account.
For steel the ratios between », u and t would remain the same and it
would be taken at 12,000 pounds.
The above values apply to loads which come upon the member
slowly, or in such manner as to produce no vibration. If the load is to
be applied with suddenness, lower stress must be used. The effect of
impact and vibration is commonly provided for by increasing the static
load by a certain per cent, for each member. Bouscaren specifies an
increase of 100 % for floor beam hangers. The common practice comes
nearer to 50 % for hangers and 35 % for beams and stringers. The
methods suggested by Prof. Wm Cain to be used with the Launhardt-
Weyrauch formulae, and strongly advocated by Jas. M. Wilson, C. E.,
is as follows:—Let the above formulae
a = 10,000(1 -f J c)
a = 10,000(1 — i C)
be the formulae for loads applied without shock. Now, as the shock is
caused by the live load entirely, and as the effect of impact increases as
c or c' decreases, Prof. Cain assumes arbitrarily that a' = i (1 — c), where
&amp;' is the total effect of impact per unit of cross section, and i is an arbi-
trary constant. From consideration of available experiments he takes
i = 2,500 and then finds
a — a' = 10,000 (1 + J c) — 2.50J (1 — c)
or a" - 7,500 (1 + c) """
in which a" is safe working stress, the stresses in the member being
always of the same kind.
When stresses are reversed, he assumes the effect of impact to be
a',= i(l-i«')
and i is 2,500 as before. This gives
a" = 7,500(1 —J e') as safe working stress in
members subject to both tension and compression.


The Technic.
This method of Prof. Cain's is open to. serious objection on the
ground that he would make the same allowance for impact in all mem-
.hers of a bridge, which would be very wasteful of material, especially
in the main trusses of long spans..
Prof. 8. W. Robinson measured the actual deflections of a large
number of bridges under trains running from 20 to 50 miles per hour,
•and found the deflection to be from zero to 28 % greater than under the
same load applied slowly. His measurements were taken upon the
bridge as a whole, and could not be applied to individual members, and
certainly not to the floor system. Now Prof. Cain decreases the allowed
stress by an amount varying from zero under a static load to 25 %
■under an all live load. Bobinson's experiments showed that the entire
bridge might be strained 28 % more than the nominal load provided
ior, and for floor beams and stringers this allowance of 25 % is cer-
tainly too small. .
The method suggested by Prof. Geo, P. Swain seems more in accord
with both reason and practice. He says, "since all shock and vibration
•come from live load, let the live load be increased in a certain ratio, de-
pending upon the position in the structure of the member under con-
sideration, and let that member be designed in the usual manner for
this increased load. The amount of increase for the individual mem-
bers would be such as the experience of the engineer and the available
■experimental data would lead him to consider adequate."
A comparison of specifications from a number of prominent engi-
neers and bridge companies would indicate the following values as
near the average practice.
Floor beam connections and hangers, 100 %.
Stringers and floor beams, 50,%.
Span 30 40 50 60 75 100 150 200
Increase 40% 35% 30% 20% 25% 15% 10% 5%
The use of a schedule such as this adds little to the work of com-
puting, and will give results that agree very closely with the require-
ments indicated by the action of structures in actual use.
At the present time these formulae are used by a large number of
engineers and Bridge Companies, and many important structures have
been designed by them. It is urged against them that they increase
the work of computation, and that in any case the constants are arbi-
trary, therefore they are no better than other empirical methods. Besides
this, while they agree with experiments at the limits, we have not suffi-
cient data to affirm that they are correct for intermediate points, that
is, we have nothing to prove that the locus should not be a curve of
greater or less deflection, instead of a right line.


103
Finally, it remains to be proved that the conditions which are found
at the point of rupture may be used in discussion of stresses well within
.the elastic limits.
These objections have been repeatedly advanced and to many engi
gineers have seemed sufficient to render their use inadvisable.
In answer to them it may be urged that they provide for such a dis-
tribution of material that the structure may be made much lighter than
Joy the empirical methods. In large structures this difference in weight
would more than compensate for the extra work involved, which is in
.reality very slight. The insufficiency of experimental data applies no
more to these formulae than to any others, and since they are the only
ones that attempt to use rational methods, they are to that extent com-
mendable. And while it is true that in workmanship and uncertainty
as to hidden faults in manufactured steel preclude the possibility of
any large increase in the allowable strains, it is also true that we have
not reached the maximum economy in distribution of material. And
while these formulae do not give perfect results, they are a decided
improvement upon those formerly used, and the best at present avail-
able. C. G. Wrentmore, B, S., '93.
Some Labor Experiments.
The best method to apply in handling the ordinary laborer to obtain
from him a fair return for the compensation which has been established
as that due for a man's services, is one of the subjects still unsettled in
the minds of employers and always open for discussion in the labor
societies. The employer and the laborer seldom come to an agreement
.on the point largely because the commodity the latter considers himself
as selling, is not what the former believes himself to be buying. In
other words the laborer considers that he is selling, not his ability to
produce, but his time, while the employer does not want the time, but
the product of the labor the man may do. It must be confessed that
.the American practice of paying for service by the day has a strong ten-
dency to encourage the laborer's view of the case.
There have been many remedies proposed for the evils growing out
•.of this system, profit sharing, piece work, stint and premium work, and
modifications of these are examples. The usual objection to the first is
■that when there are no profits to share, but perhaps a loss instead, the
laborers grumble in the former case, and object to bearing a share in the
latter. The piece work system is arraigned as tending to promote the
■strong at the expense of the weak, as leading men to overwork, and
■especially as causing in the end a reduction of wages. The same argu-
ments are brought against the stint and reward system and the ordinary
laboring man of today will advance his theory in about this form: (a)


The Technic.
The world, society, or someone owes every man a living (whether he can
earn it or not), (ft) This living is represented by a compensation of as
much as he can get, which is usually not less than fifteen cents per hour
on public work, (c) If it is not possible for the good workman to get
more than this compensation without crowding out the poorer one he
must content himself with doing part of the poorer man's work and shar-
ing equally in the compensation. This creed while it is not exactly that
held by the more advanced of the labor leaders is nevertheless the one
held by nine out of every ten members of labor societies. In practice-
the outcome of this as far as the employer is concerned, isthatin a gang
of say one hundred men, whatever the wages paid, the daily output of"
the whole will be just one hundred times the output of the poorest man
in it after the gang has got fairly to work.
These conditions having been contended with in water works con-
struction as well as elsewhere, the piece work system was in trod uced in the
excavating and filling of trenches, the excavation and filling being paid
for by the cubic yard, the compensation being graded according to the
character of the material worked. The results of the experiment when
applied to Detroit will be detailed. The inauguration of the work there
was accompanied by riot and bloodshed, but this has no bearing on the
true economic consideration of the subject; the simple fact being that a
mob of ignorant laborers aroused by the wilful misstatements of would
be labor leaders attacked a small gang of men who were at work by the
day, and in the conflict which ensued three men were killed and several
wounded. As the work was an experiment particular pains were taken
in collecting data in regard to the earnings of the men and the cost of
the work. Each man was assigned a station and the compensation
allowed was: for sand or loose earth that could easily be shoveled with-
out picking, ten cents per cubic yard; for earth requiring to be picked
or that could be best handled by using a pick fifteen cents per cubic
yard; and the various grades of digging from the latter up to the
hardest were rated from fifteen cents to twenty-five cents per cubic
yard. Before discussing the actual results of the experiments the ob-
jections to,'and advantages of the system will be considered. The
greatest apparent objection is the opportunity for dishonesty on the
part of the inspector who rates the digging, for the fact that the laborer
when he begins his section can not tell how much he will receive for it
when it is completed, renders the latter almost entirely at the mercy of
of the inspector, as very few laborers can figure the contents of a trench
and almost none can do so if there has been a cave-in from the sides.
The objections that it encourages men to overwork holds good here,
but that it allows the strong to crowd out the weak is hardly a valid
argument against the system itself, for the prime object of it is to allow
each laborer to do as much or as little as he cares to do, and to be paid


109
for what he actually accomplishes. There are some reasons why the
system ig more properly applicable to public than to private work. In
the former there is always an element of politics or at least one is likely
to be compelled to give all who come a chance so that the poor laborer
must be employed as well as the good, while on private work the em-
ployer can insist on having only the best of men. So in public work
the piece system enables each applicant to have the chance of earning
what he is able to and insure to the taxpayer a reasonable return
for money expended.
During the season of 1893 laborers were paid $1.50 per day of ten
hours. They were worked mainly in small gangs alternately digging,
laying and filling. The cost of labor in laying pipe was as follows for
various sizes.
In unpaved streets with slushed or wet back filling.
Labor on 79,956 feet of 6 inch pipe averaged 26.84 cents per foot.
In paved streets with dry pounded back-filling.
Labor on 30,852 feet of 6 inch pipe averaged 41.29 cents per foot.
Labor on 7,436 feet of 8 inch pipe averaged 53.63 cents per foot.
With the inauguration of the piece system in 1894, the plan was also
adopted of having one gang do the digging entirely, followed by a sec-
ond gang which laid the pipe and a third gang did the filling. Under
this regime and paying for excavation and filling by the yard the follow-
ing costs resulted.
Labor 10,461 feet of 6 inch pipe in unpaved streets averaged 18.86
cents per foot, a saving of 30 %.
Labor on 591 feet of 6 inch pipe in paved streets averaged 32.60
cents per foot, a saving of 21 %.
Labor on 3.887 feet of 8 inch pipe in paved streets averaged 31.30
cents per foot, a saving of 42%.
This for the employer's side of the question.
As to the laborers share.
31 men working 899 hours excavating earned $159,67, or 17f cents
per hour.
Working by the day they would have received f133,85, or 15 cents
per hour.
The average earning in 6 hours was $1.06J.
93 men working 402 hours excavating, earned 190.26, or 22.45 cents
per hour.
Working by the day they would have received $60.30, or 15 cents per
hour.
The average earning in six hours was $1.35.
The poorest man dug 3.7 yards in 6 hours and earned 74 ceuts.
The two best men dug 11.1 yards each in 6 hours and earned $2.22
each.


The Technic.
In filling it was found that except for slushed work the piece sys-
tem was not so satisfactory, because of the very rigid inspection required
to prevent the men pounding from slighting their work. The prices
paid for filling for wet work was 7J cents per cubic yard in the ditch and
for pounded filling 27 cents. In pounding the men were divided into
crews of five or six men each and assigned to sections in a body. One
man then shoveled in and the rest pounded. As further exampled, the
following records of entire gangs, not picked men or sorted reports, are
given.
51 men digging worked 745J hours and earned $226.48, or an average
of 30| cents per hour.
78 men digging worked 993 hours and earned $253.19, or an average
of 25J cents per hour.
96 men digging worked 1.578J hours and earned $318.24, or an aver-
age of 21f cents per hour.
71 men filling worked 928 hours and earned $363.14, or an average of
39 cents per hour.
After this experiment had continued for sixty days it was decided
to try days work again at $1.25 for eight hours labor. The work was
handled under the same system as in the case of piece work. The costs
of laying for the first month and a half under this scheme were:
Labor on 51,693 feet of 6 inch pipe in unpaved street averaged 17.03
cents per foot.
Labor on 1,541 feet of 6 inch pipe in paved streets averaged 28.4
cents per foot.
It is seen at once that by this system the cost of work was reduced
below that under the piece system, but it is to be remembered when
comparing the entire costs of laying that under the piece work system
only about 50% of the work was effected by it and that as appears from
the figures below the compensation allowed for filling was greater in
proportion than that for digging. Comparing the digging alone we have
the following figures:
By day work, 16,221 feet of 6 inch trench cost $1,343.36, or 8.29 cents
per foot.
By piece work, 15,581 feet of 6 inch trench cost $1,267.91, or 8.14 cents
per foot.
Comparing the filling.
By day work, 16,221 feet of 6 inch trench cost $849.54. or 5.24 cents
per foot.
By piece work, 9,345 feet of 6 inch trench cost $549.62, or 5.88 cents
per foot.
The totals of items affected by the piece system were: by day 13.53
cents per foot, and bj the piece, 14.02 bents per foot, which makes a dif-
ference of about one-half a cent per foot for economy in favor of the


107
day work plan so far as the employer is concerned, but turning to the
laborer we find that under the day system the compensation was $1.25
for eight hours, while under the piece system it was 12.18 for the same
time, which is an increase of nearly 75%. It therefore seems that if the
compensation were so adjusted as to divide this profit between the
laborer and the employer the piece system would offer considerable
advantages in the matter of economy. From these figures it appears that
the laborer, working by the piece will do about 50% more work than
when working by the day, which agrees with the statement of Traut-
wine that "When laborers are scarce and wages are high, men can
scarcely be depended upon to do three-fourths of the work which they
readily accomplish when wages are low and fresh hands are waiting to
be hired in case they are discharged.1' G. S. Williams, B. S., '88.
Absorption of an Insulated Wire.
It has frequently been noticed that the value obtained for the insu-
lation resistance of a cable, or insulated wire, is dependent on how the
measurement is made, and that the cable forms a conductor whose capa-
tice is a function of the time. Many methods of measuring insulation
resistance ignore these variations in capacity and naturally lead to erron-
eous results. Fortunately the value obtained is always lower than the
true insulation resistance. Such methods are unsatisfactory and should
be rejected in favor of methods which require a long electrification of
the cable before the beginning of the observations and do not allow the
•discharge of the cable during them. By these means errors due to vari-
able capacity may be avoided. Such a method was described by the
writer in The Technic for 1891, p. 41.
The variable capacity may be studied most conveniently by charging
the cable at a constant potential for several hours until, practically
speaking,'no more charge will be absorbed. When ready to begin the
observations, the charging circuit should be broken; after an instant the
cable should be short circuited through a very small resistance, and
after another instant insulated again until it is desired to discharge it
through a galvanometer whose constant is known. The cable is after-
wards charged for as long a time as convenient and the operation
repeated for a different period of insulation.
! The instantaneous discharge removes practically all except the
absorbed charge, and the second discharge removes the quantity that
has become free during the intervening period. If various periods are
chosen, the results may be tabulated or expressed in the form of a
curve.
The cable experimented on was about 1000 feet long, had an instan-
taneous capacity of 0,075 microfarad and an insulation resistance of


The Technic.
fully 400,000 megohms. A storage battery was used to charge the cable
at 73 volts for several hours. To obtain uniformity in the opening and
closing of the keys, a pendulum device was used to open the charging
circuit, next to close the discharging circuit and later to open it again.
The final discharge was obtained by closing another key by hand after
the desired intervals.
The quantities of electricity passing through the galvanometer and
the rise in potential during the period of insulation were then calcu-
lated. The following results were obtained:—

way was quite negligable, being somewhat less than 0.4% in the longest

The Actipn of the Soil on Gas Pipe Trolley Poles, Cedar
Poles, Steam Pipes, Etc
Experiments with ordinary four-inch gas pipe used as trolley poles
and set in concrete up to the surface of the ground without other coat-
ing developed that they would become corroded through at about ten
inches below the surface in about three years, forming a black deposit.
The life of white cedar poles in the clay soil of Detroit is said to be
about thirteen years without protection or treatment of the butts.
Norway pine poles have lasted in the same soil about thirty years
bat were badly rotted at the surface line. They, however, rot very soon
in a sandy soil. The more pitchy ones decay first. Winter cut poles


and those cut in Summer with the sapwood removed are more lasting
than those containing green sapwood.
In a sandy soil frost has gone so deep as to render inoperative the
ground plates of a fire alarm telegraph which were buried five feet
deep, while the same plates in similar locations in the same town, but in
clay, were not affected. In Detroit the experience of the Fire Depart-
ment with hydrants shows that sand heaves from frost more than clay
does.
It is reported that steam piping covered with a non-conductor and
maintained at a temperature from 250° to 300° Fahrenheit, though
buried in the ground will not corrode while a hot water return at 212°
Fahrenheit, similarly covered and buried would corrode from the out-
side by rusting.
In the course of some construction, recently,it was found necessary
to tear out and rebuild some man-holes in the streets that had been
standing about six months; and it was then noticed that in concrete
made of the same materials in the same proportions, there was no ap-
preciable difference in the strength as regards the resistance to breaking
up and taking out between those cases where the material had been
thoroughly rammed in place moistened only so that the moisture just
gathered on the surface, and those where it was slushed in very soft
and allowed to set under water.
Recently in one of the Detroit manufacturing establishments a
punch having a cast iron body, and used for punching heavy boiler
plate was broken across the horn which holds the die and receives the
thrust of the punch. The fracture was through a section that was
nearly square with a rip at the back, the area being about sixty square
inches. The punch was mended by carefully cleaning and dressing off
the surfaces and putting the frame in the sand leaving the fracture
about one-quarter of an inch open. Iron was then poured through the
fracture and allowed to run off until the sides became plastic then the
mould was closed and the interstice poured full After cooling the
edges were dressed and the punch has since been doing its former
work. U. S. W., '88.
Lamp Method of Comparing Alternating and Direct Cur-
rent Voltages.
Where one has no alternating standard voltmeter or has one of
doubtful accuracy, the following method will be found useful.
Connect a lamp of suitable voltage in series with a two point switch
(A, B, C,) as shown in figure, so that by throwing the lever (B) from side
to side, the lamp will be lighted at will either by the direct or alterna-
ting current. Adjust the resistance (R) which is in series with the lamp


The Technic.
on the direct current side, until by rapid reverses of the switch, no vari-
ation of candle-power can be detected in the lamp. Then there is a bal-
ance; the voltage of the alternating circuit is indicated by the direct

current voltmeter, (V). The writer has used this method repeatedly in
checking instruments, and has found it perfectly reliable within half a
volt in all cases, and a trained eye can detect a difference of one-tenth
of a volt. D. B. Cheever, B. S., '91.

loose. Or considering the filling alone the cost per foot for wet work
was 47| cents, and for pounded work was 75f cents.
As to the results of the backfilling experiment other than the
reduced cost, it was found that the filling in the wet way required two
to three days longer than in the dry way. So far as the condition of
the trench and roadway were concerned in an unpaved street the filling
was rounded up about four inches above the grade of the rest of the
street both in the wet and the dry work and this has been sufficient to
provide for the settlement in both cases. The dry work shows itself
somewhat more smooth than the wet but hardly sufficiently so to be
noticeable in driving over the ground.

On this work great pains was taken with the grading of the tile.
One row being at the bottom and another half way up, and all were con-
nected to sewers. As a result from the time the work was completed,
the ditch has been the best part of the street, and especially so in
muddy seasons.
In the above memoranda there are developed some relations be-
tween earth in the ground and in wagon boxes.
In Case I of 24-inch pipe, the pipe volume was about 110 cubic yards,
but the quantity of earth hauled away from the trench by wagon load
measurement was about 1,300 cubic yards, or 2,709 cubic yards swelled
1,190 cubic yards in handling amounting to about 44 %.
In Case II, of 24-inch pipe, the pipe volume in slush work was
about 55 cubic yards, and there was hauled about 611 cubic yards of
surplus. For the pounded work the pipe volume was about 28 cubic
yards, and the surplus about 252 cubic yards. Or the amount of the
swelling in the former instance was 556 cubic yards in 1,200, or about
44J %, and in the latter it was 224 cubic yards in 763, or about 30 %.
In Case IV of 16-inch and 12-inch pipe, the pipe volumes were
about 355 cubic yards and the surplus was about 1,030 yards. The swell-
ing, therefore, was 675 cubic yards in 3,441 cubic yards, or about 20 %
In Case V, the pipe volumes were about 339 yards and the surplus
only about 349 yards. This was due to the fact that a large part of the
earth excavated and ordinarily being surplus was; used in rounding off
the top of the trench after filling.
Cage VI.—Laborers paid $1.25 for eight hours. In a paved street.
All back tilling pounded. Connections every 300 feet. Size of pipe 12'.
Length of line 1,048'. Depth, 5 feet.

In all of the foregoing each connection made was with a line
already in service, and therefore, involving a more or less complicated
shut off. Besides this, in almost every case, there was a pre-existing
pipe which had to be removed. In Cases I to V inclusive a record of
the cost of this labor was kept and deducted, but in the remaining
■cases no account was taken of it either way. G. S. W , '88.
Pole-Line Construction.
The following is a series of notes collected by the writer while on
the "pole-line gang" during his connection with the Detroit Public
Xighting Commission.
The poles were cedar and pine. The cedar poles ranged from 40
feet up to 55, and the pine, from 55 feet to 75 feet. Though cedar is
usually given the preference for longevity, there are pine poles standing
in Detroit which were planted twenty-rive years ago, and are still in
good shape. This record is excelled by but few cedar poles. The depth
of planting the poles varied according to the length of the poles. The
40 foot poles were planted 5 feet, the 50 foot 6 feet, the longer ones at
least 6i feet. The poles are set 130 feet apart or 40 to the mile. The
poles were guyed wherever the line departed from a straight line, and
also in many places to take care of strains due to wind pressure.
The poles, 40 or 50 feet long were planted in the ordinary manner,
using the " dead-man" and pikes. A gang of 18 or 20 men would raise
20 poles in a day. The long poles were raised by means of a team of
horses, using a gin-pole and tackle. A gang of 10 men in addition to
the team would raise 6 or 7 poles in a day. The act of raising, taking
but a few minutes compared with the time for the accessories.
The cross-arms were set in the gains previously prepared, and fast-
ened either by means of a £ inch bolt or by lag screws, care being taken


The Technic.
in the planting of the poles that there would be no tension on the bolt
or screws. The cross-arms are pine, the section being x 4} inches.
They vary in length according to the number of pins. A four-pin arm
is 5 feet long, an eight-pin arm is 10 feet long, i. e., the pins are 14 inches
apart and have 4 inches to spare at each end. The six and eight pin-
arms were braced by two wrought-iron strips, each \" x \" and 18"
long. These were fastened by 3 inch lag screws.
The pins used were selected oak, properly turned and varnished
before being set in the arms. A special single petticoat glass insulator
was designed; minimum surface and maximum length of path from
wire to peg was striven for.
The wire used for the series arc light circuit was No. 6, B. &amp; S.
Gauge with weather proof insulation. Both hard and soft drawn copper
wires were used. Where the lines were straight and many wires close
together, the hard drawn was used. Where many loops and turns were
necessary, the soft drawn wire was used as it is more pliable and easily
handled. The breaking strains of the hard and soft drawn wires are
60,000 and 30,000 pounds respectively. The tension to which the wires
were drawn was 100 to 110 pounds. This was measured by a spring bal-
ance in connection with the jack-strap. In telephone work with a No.
8 iron wire, the tension commonly used is 300 pounds. By keeping the
tension uniform, the sag varies with the span. The relation connecting
the involved quantities is expressed in the following equation.
t = w —
8 s
t — tension in pounds.
I = length of span in feet,
s = sag in feet.
w — weight of wire per foot in pound.
The breaking strength of cedar poles is given approximately by the
equation,
p = 63.7 *
p — breaking strain.
(I = diameter in inches of pole at surface of the ground.
I = distance in feet from ground to point of application of p.
It should be borne in mind that this is only approximate, and that
p is the breaking strain and not the safe working strain.
Detroit has undoubtedly the finest set of pole-lines in the country.
The poles are all painted and bear the P. L. C. monogram. Inside the
half-mile circle, conduits were laid and the pole lines were run in the
most unobjectionable streets and alleys.

Range of Speed in an Electric Motor.
In an electric pumping plant which was put into operation during
the past year, the requirements of the situation seemed to call for a
considerable variation in the speed of the pumps. A shunt motor of 40
horse-power, wound for 500 volts, was used to drive a duplex pump of
500,000 gallons capacity. A speed reduction of 30 per cent, was required.
Evidently the speed reduction might be obtained by inserting a
resistance in series with the armature of the motor. By this method,
however, the total power required at the reduced speed would be sub-
stantially the same as at full speed, the portion not required to drive
the motor being wasted in the resistance box. For some purposes" this
would not be objectionable, but for continuous pumping the loss of
efficiency involved is not admissible.
Another method of varying the speed is by changing the strength
of the field magnets. If this can be done by strengthening the mag-
nets, there is no objection; but in many machines the field cores are so
nearly saturated that this will avail only to a slight extent. By weaken-
ing the field magnets an increase of speed is produced, so that if the
gearing be altered in the proper manner, the required variation may be
obtained. The difficulty which presents itself in this case is the
increased liability to sparking at the commutator when the field
strength is diminished.
In order to determine whether in this particular motor the speed
variation could be produced by weakening the fields, tests were made
which gave the following results:—

The net horse-power is the power consumed in forcing the water
and was calculated from the gauge reading and suction lift together

with the dimensions and revolutions of the pump. During these tests
the sparking was not at all excessive.
Another series of tests was undertaken to determine what could be
done in the way of strengthening the fields. For this purpose the field
coilswere connected in parallel and an adjustable resistance was placed
in series. The following were the results obtained:—

EDITORIALS.
It is with the greatest pleasure that we announce in this number of
The Technic that from October, '05. the Engineers will constitute a
Department of Engineering.. This was so ordained by the Regents in
the spring of '95. Then the Engineers will have severed their long con-
nection with the Lits. Nevertheless, they will still retain the privilege
of electing work in the Department of Literature, Science and the
Arts. We are sure that the Engineers will rank as the most vigorous,
enthusiastic, and thoroughly alive people on the campus, even though
they are the hardest worked students in Ann Arbor. "The Engineers
are the people and they must be heard."
Here is to the success of the Department of Engineering and to its
most highly esteemed Dean, C. E. Greene.
* *
*
Behold—The Technic is out, and before Commencement, too. We
are modest, but we can not refrain from saying that we, the '95 Board,
turn over to the Society to be presented to the public one of the most
valuable Technics ever published. One more thing we can say with
considerable pride is, that The Technic this year has paid for itself.
The secret of the success of this Board was a timely start, followed by
hard work, perseverance and perfect concord. Our advice to our suc-
cessors is " to go and do likewise."
This year the Board took upon itself the responsibility of reading
all the proof in town. This was the only means of facilitating matters.
Whenever possible, if our future contributors will send in type-written
copies, the reading of proof will be done to the entire satisfaction of
everybody and no delay be caused. We take occasion to thank Prof.
C. E. Greene for reading the proof of Mr. R. C. Gemmell's article.
* * *
We regret very much that we were not able to publish some very
good articles by M essrs. Hildner, Gavett, Cheever, Brandon and Keyes.
* * *
The Technic Board hereby presents to the Engineering Society the
solid oak book case to be found in the Engineering Reading Room. It
is the desire of the Board that all books of reference be transferred to
this case, and a complete set of all the exchanges as far as possible be
placed therein, together with whatever miscellaneous matter that may be
desired for reference. It is their expectation that the Society will have
made a number of duplicate keys to be distributed among the members,
a deposit equal to the value of the key being required.


The Technic.
It is desired and hoped that, since the Society has now a good place
to keep books for reference, the Engineering Alumni will be kind
enough to present to the Society any duplicate books they may possess.
* *
The Technic hereby presents its most cordial thanks to Profs.
D'Ooge and Damon for the loan of their nighly valued photographs of
Briinnow and Watson.
* *
*
We are under considerable obligations to Supt. C. G. Taylor for the
photographs of the Heating Plant, and, also, we take the opportunity
of thanking him for the oak stand which he has had made for the
Reading Room.
* *
*
The Technic is much obliged to the following gentlemen for mak-
ing drawings, etc., for this issue:—Messrs. Roberts, Skinner, Hoadley,
Tenney, King, Johnston and Lamont. Our associate editor, H.W. Wyc-
koff, kindly made the new design for the cover. It is hoped that the
future Technics will adopt this same cut.
* #
*
We wish to call attention to the fact that the Society has been privi-
leged to add to its honorary list J. I!. Johnson, Professor of Civil Engi-
neering in Washington University, Missouri.

Many of our advertisers ivill be found to be of special interest to
the Civil Engineering profession. We would call special attention to
the Rhodes-Williams Siphon, manufactured by the Flush Tank Co., of
Chicago; also to the various sewer pipe supplies, made by the Jackson
Fire Clay Co. and the Union Sewer Pipe Co. The Safety Man-Hole
Cover, manufactured by the Co-operative Foundry, of Detroit, is used
all over the states and is highly commended by the trade journals.

"Government Is a contrivance of human wisdom to pro-

So also the governing element of the Marsh Steam Valve is
a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for a self-governiri"
and self-regulating steam pump. It is the same with pu mps as
with people. With the largest measure of self-government the
highest development of utility and efficiency is possible.
Will pump condensation from coils, etc. direct to Boiler. No Traps, No

afterwards as professor in 1859, and held the chair until the summer of
1872. He then resigned to accept a professorship at the Stevens Institute
of Technology, Hoboken, N. J., with which school he is still connected.
He has written several books on engineering subjects, one of the most
recent and valuable of which is his Thermodynamics. Under Professor
Wood's able management, during his fifteen years of service, this depart-
ment attained a high degree of excellence and became widely and favor-
ably known.
Of course the number of students in engineering was for some time
very small. In 1857 six students were mentioned as studying civil engi-
neering in their senior year; but the course, with the degree of C. E.,
was authorized by the Board of Regents, Dec. 22, 1858. The first degrees,
two in number, were conferred in 1860. There were three graduates in
1861; one in 1862; five in 1863; one in 1864; and six in 1865. During the
civil war some attention was paid to fortification and military science.
There were seven graduates in 1866, and eight in 1867, of whom two
received the degree of mining engineer. From this time until 1872 several
students graduated in mining, and the yearly number receiving degrees
in both branches rose to seventeen.
It may be remarked in passing that the number of graduates from
year to year by no means represents one fourth of the number of students
receiving instruction. The lower classes each year are usually much
larger than the graduating class. In addition to the special students who
complete most, but not all, of the required course, not a few, upon
receiving their training in surveying, drafting, or other work, embrace
opportunities which offer to engage in the practice of that branch, and
pursue their studies no further at the University. Some find the mathe-
matical and technical work more severe than they anticipated, and drop
out of the course. Others, who have entered without a clear understand-
ing of the aims and duties of the engineering profession, conclude that it
is not one for which they have a natural aptitude.
Even before 1872 the civil engineering course had become too exten-
sive for one instructor to care for, and assistance had been obtained for
short terms. In the spring of 1872 Charles S. Denison, class of '71,
University of Vermont, came to Michigan as instructor in drawing, and
Assistant Professor Joseph B. Davis, U. of M., '68, was, in June, 1872,
given charge of surveying. The writer, Harvard, '62, and Mass. Inst, of
Technology, '68, was called from practice in New England to succeed
Professor Wood. The unbroken term of service of these three instructors,
who have directed the technical part of the course in civil engineering, is
remarkable, and the almost daily intercourse through twenty-four college
years has served but to knit closer the ties of friendship and esteem.

In 1875, the Legislature of Michigan, at the solicitation of a member
from the Upper Peninsula, voted the establishment of a School of Mines
at this University, and appropriated funds for two years for the new
professorships created by the act. The same act also made provision for
a professorship in architecture. Professor William H. Pettee, Harvard,
'61, came from that University to take the chair of Milling Engineering,
Byron W. Cheever, U. of M., '63, conducted the work in Metallurgy, and
W. L. B. Jenney, C. E., a well-known architect of Chicago, was appointed
professor of architecture.
The Legislature of 1877 failed to renew these appropriations. Profes-
sor Jenney was given indefinite leave of absence, which terminated the
architectural course just established; while Professor Pettee, transferred
to the chair of Geology, continued to instruct such students as desired
work in mining engineering.
An act of Congress, passed in 1879, authorizing the detail of assistant
engineers of the navy to teach marine engineering and iron shipbuilding
at colleges and technical schools, opened a way of starting a course in
mechanical engineering with but little additional expense. Professor
Mortimer E. Cooley, U. S. Naval Academy, '78, was detailed by the
Secretary of the Navy, on the request of President Angell, in 1881, and,
after four years of such detailed duty, resigned from the navy and became
definitely connected with this University. Mr. C. G. Taylor, a graduate
of the school at Worcester, Mass., came to the shops in 1883, and has
been superintendent since 1885. The first degree in mechanical engineer-
ing was conferred in 1883.
■• The small frame building, veneered with brick, in which the first
shop-practice was carried out, has gradually given place to the present
Mechanical Laboratory, with its foundry, forge-shop, iron and wood-
working rooms, drafting rooms, testing laboratory, etc. The rooms for
instruction, which for many years comprised the larger part of the south
half of the south wing of University Hall, have been replaced by the
Dewer and more commodious ones of the new Engineering building. It
is not unlikely that the department before long may find its present
quarters crowded, if the rate of increase in attendance of recent years is
maintained.
Professor Henry S. Carhart, Wesleyan University, '69, came from
Northwestern University to take the chair of Physics here in 1886, and
soon was prepared to offer so much work in electricity, a branch especially
attractive to him, that the University was able to open a course in Elec-
trical Engineering. There had already been a demand for such a line of
work, and the movement of students in that direction continues to be very

large. In 1889 Assistant Professor George W. Patterson, Yale, '84, Mass.
Inst, of Technology, '87, came to the University as instructor.
Professor Cheever died in 1888 and Professor Edward D. Campbell,
U. of M., '86, succeeded to his work in 1890. In the. same year Assistant
Professor Prank 0. Wagner, U. of M., '84, joined the staff in Mechanical
Engineering.
The number of graduates in 1890, when the first electrical degrees
were granted, was twenty, viz., twelve civil, one mining, four mechanical
and three electrical engineering students. The number in all classes was
159. The attendance rose to 203 in '90-1; 243 in '91-2; and has con-
siderably exceeded three hundred the present year. The number of
engineering degrees conferred last commencement was fifty.
The tone of the department is excellent, and the outlook for the
future is most encouraging.
NOTES REGARDING BOILER ECONOMY.
BY R. C. CARPENTER,'75.
The construction of the steam boiler has attracted about as much
attention from various inventors as any problem which has yet been
advanced for solution. The problem is no doubt rendered more attractive
from the fact that every known form is far from perfect and that its use is
accompanied with more or less difficulty; this has successively led every
inventor to believe that he could produce a form more perfect in every
respect than any which has preceded it. So much has been done that it
is very difficult indeed to conceive any form of surface or arrangement of
pipe or tubes, which has not been the subject of careful trial an&lt;J experi-
ment for a steam boiler. •
Some of the inventors have fondly imagined that they could produce
a boiler which would utilize' unknown and undiscovered properties of
heat and hence would produce a greater evaporation than that considered
possible with our present knowledge of the heat generating power of
fuels. While such performances have been broadly claimed, it is I believe
a fact, that every construction which so far has been put to the test of
actual trial has proved not only less efficient than the theoretical standard
but in most cases has fallen very far below that possible as expressed
in such a standard. In the light of actual accomplishment it does not
seem possible or probable that there are undiscovered properties of heat,
which can tend to increase the efficiency of any form of steam generator
beyond our present standard of heating value of fuels.


19
So far as can be predicted from the numerous tests which have already
been made on different types of boilers, the form of the boiler alone has
very little to do with its actual efficiency. If a series of tests made on
boilers of very different construction, water tube, tubular or marine types,
be compared it will generally be found that the relative amount of fuel
burned to steam produced has more effect on the efficiency than any other
expressed condition. This is well shown by a series of tests made by a
board appointed by the United States in 1885 and 1886, the results of
which are given in full in Weisbach Steam Engine. By plotting the
results of these tests with reference to the weight of combustible in
pounds burned per square foot of heating surface we find that the results
may be represented quite accurately by a very simple equation of the form
y = a — b |/ x .
In the above equation a is the highest theoretical vaporation possible
corrected for radiation and can usually be taken as 14.3, x is the com-
bustible burned per sq. ft. of water heating surface in the boiler, 6 is a
coefficient depending upon conditions, in the experiments cited was equal
to 4.5 for a tubular boiler and to 5 for a water tube boiler, y is the actual
evaporation of water in pounds from and at 212 per pound of combustible.
The equation seems to be true nearly within all practicable limits but
fails for very high values of x. The form of the equation is a parabola and
is sufficiently true for comparison of results.
It is commonly claimed that circulation of the water in the boiler has
very great influence on the economy of fuel and one cannot doubt but
that under certain circumstances and in certain constructions, circulation
is of very great importance in bringing the colder water of the boiler in
contact with the hottest heating surfaces and in carrying off the steam as
fast as it is produced. The best records of economy ever obtained by the
writer was from a boiler of a type of such form that circulation of special
currents from the steam space to the water heating space was practically
impossible. The writer has also seen other tests, by other engineers,
which would corroborate the conclusion, that circulation in some forms of
boilers at least is not essential to highest economy and that form alone is
not of great importance as a gauge of efficiency.
The circulation of the heated gases which pass off from the fuel
should be such as to remain in contact for as great a time as possible
with the surfaces for absorbing heat in the boiler; this requirement is
probably of great importance. It is possible to arrange a given amount
of heating surface in such a manner that it would receive but a small
percentage of the total heat given off, and in that case other considera-
tions than those mentioned would seriously affect the economy. Con-


The Technic.
sidering, however, the principal types of boilers which have a commercial
standing in this country, it will I think be found from a study of the tests
made that there is very little difference in the efficiency of heating surface
when other conditions are the same. This in other words would signify
that one square foot of heating surface is of equal value in every kind of
boiler. The writer makes this proposition advisedly and with full know-
ledge that it will be bitterly controverted by many manufacturers of
boilers. It may be said respecting this proposition that a series of tests
made in boilers of different classes may be quoted as showing the exact
contrary of this proposition. I know that one manufacturer at least is
prepared to show a difference of this kind by a series of results of actual
tests which prove, however, on close examination to be not fairly com-
parative from this standpoint only, and hence cannot be accepted as
establishing his point. The few tests which have been made which are
strictly comparable support the proposition as made that in the older type
of boilers of every class the heating surface is essentially of the same
efficiency.
In testing boilers it will be found that many conditions seriously
affect the result. Thus if one attempts to repeat the same test he is likely
to find a difference in results of fully 10%. This difference is not due to
errors made in the test, for if the quantities which influence the results
are carefully observed and if the test is continued ten hours or more in
length so as to eliminate errors of judgment in starting and stopping, the
errors should not exceed two per cent. The variation in results then
which are actually obtained must be due to variation in other conditions
than those which are usually observed. The various conditions which
are of importance as effecting the efficiency relate to the method of firing,
to the character of fuel, to the introduction of air into the furnace and to
the temperature and atmospheric conditions in the boiler room. Of these
various conditions none have more importance on the results than the
method of firing, and no conditions are harder or more difficult to observe
accurately. The difference between good and bad firing may often make
15% in the results and the difference between the results with two good
firemen is often nearly 10%. It is difficult indeed to define the precise
duties of a good fireman, since his actions must be regulated almost
entirely by the exercise of judgment. The good fireman studies all
conditions, he puts on coal at exactly the right moment, maintains the
temperature of boiler room at the best possible point, he admits only
sufficient air to insure perfect combustion and looks out that a large
portion of his coal is not shaken into the ash-pit. He does not necessarily
work harder than a poor fireman, on the contrary the writer has often
thought that a lazy man made a superior fireman. The lazy man who


21
carefully studies to prevent unnecessary exertion and the shovelling of
coal can by such means often increase the economy of the plant. On the
other hand, a nervous, active man, who is constantly afraid his steam
pressure may fall is likely to be continually opening the fire door to
examine the condition of the fires, shaking or raking the fuel, all of which
tend to prevent perfect combustion.
The greatest obstacle in the way of high economy in boilers is not so
much in the lack of perfect combustion, as it is the admission of a great

excess of air into the fuel. The drawing of large quantities of air into the
fire at the temperature of the boiler room and discharging this into the
chimney at a considerably higher temperature means the loss of a great
quantity of useful heat. One must have sufficient air for the perfect


The Technic.
combustion of the fuel and the loss which is due to heating this air to a
higher temperature than that of the room cannot be avoided, but that due
to heating an excess of air is to a great extent unnecessary. The amount
of air required is about 12)^ pounds for each pound of pure carbon and
about 36 pounds for each pound of hydrogen. The preceding diagram
(Figure 1) shows the various chimney losses that will be experienced in
burning pure carbon for different amounts of air. It will be noted that
with a flue temperature of 450 degrees with simply air enough for perfect
combustion that we have a chimney loss of 10%, if twice the air required
be admitted the chimney loss will reach to about 18%, or in other words
8% of the fuel is unnecessarily carried up the chimney due to the admis-
sion of an excess of air.
The losses due to imperfect combustion are usually much less than
supposed, especially if the fuel be anthracite coal. The anthracite coal
has very little volatile combustible matter, and hence the products of
combustion are almost entirely those which are due to the combustion of
carbon. If the combustion is complete the product is earbondioxide COs
and nitrogen. If the combustion is incomplete some carbon-monoxide is
given off, in which case about two-thirds of the heating value of the fuel
is wasted. The condition under which carbon-monoxide is produced has
been very carefully investigated by the German chemists and it has been
found that it is only produced when there is a deficiency of free oxygen
except when the temperature is very high, in which case after-combustion
will take place as soon as the temperature is somewhat reduced. Under
the conditions which usually exist with regard to steam boilers it is
impossible for any great amount of CO to be formed and hence the loss
from this cause is always a very small one and can usually be neglected.
The bituminous coal contains considerable volatile combustible
matter. In the better grades of this coal this volatile matter is a hydro-
carbon of more value than fixed carbon, in the poorer grades the volatile
matter is largely oxygen and nitrogen and of very little use as fuel. This
coal varies in heating value from 10,000 to 16,000 B. T. U. per pound. In
the combustion of this coal it is quite possible that imperfect combustion
may take place of considerable amount. One of the principal reasons for
believing this is the fact, which is shown in nearly all boiler tests with
these different grades of coal, namely, that our losses with the same
range of temperature with bituminous coal run about 10% higher than
witli anthracite coal, that is with a bituminous coal containing about
30% of volatile matter the losses are likely to be from 30 to 40 or even
50%, while the anthracite coal burned under the same condition the
losses are usually 10% less. The writer believes that this increased loss
is largely due to imperfect combustion of the hydrocarbons. From some


23
experiments, the writer is inclined to believe that the hydrogen and the
volatile combustible constitutents of bituminous coal pass off at a low
temperature. They are likely to be discharged into the chimney with a
large volume of air which enters while the furnace doors are open. While
the doors are open the temperature although sufficient to drive off the
volatile matter is not high enough to set it on fire and the result is a very
serious loss of a valuable portion of the fuel. It is quite possible that
certain forms of furnaces reduce the losses due to this cause, but it is
also quite certain that under the best conditions our losses are higher than
those which may be attained in the burning of anthracite coal.
The effect of Wet Coal, is one often discussed and regarding which
there is considerable difference of opinion. Many firemen are to be found
who believe that the actual application of water to the coal gives better
evaporated results. This is always to be regarded as very doubtful but
there are certain fuels which are very dusty in their orig\nal conditions
which are much improved by an addition of water, since it causes them
to lie on the grate during the process of combustion and prevents the loss
which might otherwise take place by the particles flying to the chimney.
This is a physical gain and is simply the substitution of one loss for
another, in which there may be a practical advantage.
In a very hot fire moisture in the coal may be decomposed into a
water gas which is burned afterwards with good result. It is found
however, that this process affords no gain or loss, since the heat required
to produce the gas is exactly the same as that given off in its combustion.
Moreover the water produced by this combustion is discharged in a form
of steam so that the latent heat is invariably lost. This must always be
true that any water evaporated from the fuel detracts by the same amount
tiie power of evaporation from the boiler, and that a person buying wet
coal is dpubly cheated, since in the first place he pays for the water at
the same rate as the coal and in the second place this water reduces the
power of evaporating water in the boiler.
The moral to be drawn from these remarks is it seems to me this;
that no boiler test should be considered complete unless it gave us infor-
mation both as to the amount and nature of the heat losses which take
place. Indeed I think that we may go further and say that until we
know definitely the cause of the various losses we shall not be able to
improve boiler construction. The standard method of boiler testing is
deficient unless it provides means of determining not only the amount of
heat loss but the exact nature and character of such loss. It is quite
possible to determine the nature of such losses by operations which can
readily and quicklv be performed. It is hardly within the province of
this article to describe the details of such operations as they are already


The Technic.
described in other places.* It may be sufficient to say that to determine
these losses we must have a knowledge of the composition and calorimet-
ric value of the fuel used, and also that of the escaping gases from the
furnace.
The considerations mentioned would seem to indicate an essential
similarity of efficiency in boilers of good construction for each square foot
of heating surface and, if this proposition is true or even approximately
true, it must lead to the conclusion that other qualities than efficiency are
of great importance. This the writer believes to be fully true and would
urge as points of very great importance the methods of detailed construc-
tion, the facilities for cleaning, the probable safety and life and durability.
So far as relative economy is concerned the shell boilers or boilers which
contain large masses of water enclosed in cylindrical vessels are probably
equal to any that have been devised, these boilers can also be cleaned
and sediment deposited from the water is likely to do a minimum amount
of harm. These boilers are, however, always to be considered very
dangerous although the probability for an explosion is very remote in
any given case, yet when such an explosion does occur the results are
extremely disasterous. The class of boilers known as water tube contain
the water from which the steam is made in comparatively small masses
and while these boilers are not free from accidents the disasters which
happen are always of small moment and of comparatively little impor-
tance. These boilers are much superior to the others, simply for this
reason. The water tube boilers are made in a great variety of ways and
differ essentially in methods of construction and principles of operation.
Any of these boilers can be cleaned as readily as the shell boiler, while
others cannot be cleaned without absolutely destroying the boiler.
All the impurities which water possesses when it enters the boiler
will be left behind as a hard deposit on the interior surface. If the water
is very impure these deposits may choke the passages for water and
steam to such an extent as to render the boiler useless, even if not entirely
stopping the circulation. The incrustation also acts to prevent the pass-
age of heat from the fire to the water and in this way lowers the efficiency
of the heating surface as well as permitting the temperature of the iron to
raise to such a point as to lose its strength.
The experience that the writer has had with the boilers of different
classes leads him to believe that facilities for cleaning and for making
repairs is of extreme importance in the design. A general principle of
design which is safe to apply is that of constructing every part in such a
manner and of such material that an accident cannot possibly happen,
but also of preparing the plant so as to be the least affected if any possible
•See Experimental Engineering, New York, J. Wiley A Sons.


25
accident should happen. This proposition should apply I think to boiler
design and construction as well as to other features of design.
From the various considerations mentioned it would seem that if we
judge of the quality of different boilers by comparison of the results
obtained in actual tests, every possible condition which can affect the
result should be considered and given due weight. These conditions are
in addition to those which are usually considered the amount of combus-
tion, the condition of the fires and method of firing, the quality and kind
fuel. There should also be an account made of the heat supplied, of the
heat usefully converted into steam and of that carried off in the flue and
lost in various ways.

THE 5,000 HORSE-POWER TURBINES AT NIAGARA FALLS.
DeVOLSON wood.
The Falls, known the world over as "The Niagara Falls" has, for a
long time, been looked at enviously by those desiring water power. At
one time a small paper mill a few rods above the crest of the falls, close to
Goat Island, used a very little of the wat^r of the river, and still less of
its power. A small wheel below the falls, near the lower suspension
bridge used an inappreciable part of the power; this power, by rope
transmission, being transferred to a mill on the upper bank. Nearly
thirty years ago an hydraulic canal conducted water from above the falls
and discharged it below the falls, and mills near the discharge utilized
the power thus furnished. This power has recently been improved by
enlarging the canal and establishing turbines on the lower shore and
transmitting the power by means of electricity to the upper bank.


The Technic.
All these efforts were insignificant compared with some recent ones.
A "Cataract" Company has secured the necessary legislation for utiliz-
ing an immense power from the river. A subordinate company, known
as "The Niagara Falls Power Company," proposes to utilize some
100,000 horse-power of the falls. For this purpose a short canal or
bayou 250 ft. wide and 12 ft. deep, a mile or more above the crest of the
falls, has been excavated for this purpose, extending into the river and also
into the land. This conducts the water from the river to vertical shafts
at the foot of which are turbines, the discharging water being conducted
to a large tunnel 7,000 ft. long and about 21 ft. high and 18 ft, wide, which
discharges into the river below the falls. The vertical fall from the sur-
face of the water in the upper canal to the center of the wheels below is
about 136 ft.
The object of "The Power Company " is to furnish power for a mar-
ket. Many schemes have been proposed for utilizing the power. It has
been proposed to sell it to those desiring it in the city of Buffalo; to run
the cars on the Central E. R. between Buffalo - nd Niagara; to run canal
boats on the Erie Canal; to supply light for the villages and cities along
the line of this canal; and if the supply was not exhausted to light New
York and other cities. At the present time power is supplied to manu-
factories which have been established near by. An immense paper mill
has been erected at the entrance of the bayou and is driven by turbines
of the Jonval type.
The Power Company has put in place two turbines of over 5,000
horse-power each. It is of these that we desire more especially to speak.
They have been in successful operation for several months, and generate
electricity for supplying power for the manufacture of aluminium, calcium
carbide and carborumdum.
The wheels were designed by the firm of Piccard &amp; Faeseh, of Geneva,
Switzerland, and built by I. P. Morris &amp; Co., of Philadelphia, Pa. The
plan of the design is shown in Fig. 1, which was kindly furnished the
writer by Coleman Seller*, E. D., Professor of Practical Engineering in
Stevens Institute of Technology, and President and Chief Engiueer of
The Niagara Falls Power Company.
Whether it was a fault of American manufacturers in not securing for
themselves the honor of designing wheels for this place, we cannot say,
but it is known that when the Niagara Commission called for designs,
the American manufacturers submitted their trade catalogues, and the
Europeans, special designs. The conditions under which water power
exists in the two countries, and the different modes of doing business, has
led to very different systems of establishing wheels. In Europe very
mauy streams are small but have falls, and those falls differ largely;


29
while in this country most of the water falls are comparatively small,
with abundance of water; so Americans make wheels of different capaci-
ties for average falls and cast them in large quantities and keep them in
"stock" like store goods; while in Europe every wheel is designed for
its particular place.
The power of the cast American wheel is generally determined from
an actual test, and is not subject to such accurate analysis as the Four-
neyron. The Power Company wished a wheel subjected to abnormal
conditions; such as American manufacturers were not accustomed to.
The head was about 136 ft.; they desired 250 revolutions per minute, and,
as privately informed, a fixed number of feet in diameter, and to deliver
5,000 horse-power. We do not see the necessity of fixing the diameter, if
it were so done. That done the American wheels would be ruled out,
for they are of less diameter than European wheels, but deeper. But
aside from this the revolutions could not be so definitely calculated.
Other systems were discussed, such as the Pelton Wheel on a hori-
zontal shaft; the American Twin Turbine on a horizontal shaft, so as to
prevent endwise pressure on the shaft; but the large space required for
the latter and the difficulty of transmitting the power to the surface
prevented their adoption; and the European design, as mentioned above,
secured the prize.
This wheel is a double triple wheel of the Fourneyron type, radially
outflow, Fig. 1 and 2. It is double since it is really two wheels, one
below the entrance of the water through the penstock B, both of which
are firmly secured to the vertical shaft. C is the casing rigidly joined to
the penstock, and containing the distributors a, a, a. Outside of these is
the wheel containing the buckets 6, 6, 6. This determines the triple
character. Each wheel, above and below, being divided into three
chambers by horizontal disks one inch thick and a cylindrical gate out-
side of the wheel, operated by the same rods, so that when the gate is
one-third open the wheel will operate as if it were complete in itself with
one-third the full capacity. The distributors and buckets are also shown
in Fig. 1.
The radii for describing the curves of the buckets and distributors
are shown in Fig. 1. The normal sections of the distributors should be
greatest at the inside circumference and decrease as they approach the
wheel, so that the water will have a gradually increasing velocity as it
passes through them. Also the normal sections of the buckets should
decrease from the entrance to the outside, as the water increases in its
outward flow. In this respect we think the wheel is slightly defective,
for the construction of the wheel shows that the normal section is slightly
less at a d than at ef, whereas it should be the reverse.


The Technic.
The chief elements in determining the theoretical efficiency are the
initial and terminal angles of the buckets, where the remarks in regard to
the normal sections are observed. The terminal angle of the distributors
for smooth running depends also on the velocity giving maximum effect.
The general expression for the speed for best efficiency is very complex.
It depends upon the terminal angle of the distributors, the initial and
terminal angles of the walls of the buckets, the ratio of the outside to the
inside diameter of, the wheel and the coefficients of friction, and if the
crowns are plane, as in this case, the ratio of the normal sections is also
involved. The formulae for this case are in the writer's work on Turbines,
and are not, so far as he knows, in any other text-book.
The initial angle of the bucket is given in Fig. 1 as 110° 40' and
appears to be the mean angle between the face and rear of the partition,
but the writer found by comparing computations with the actual test that
the face angle should be used, and by a measurement on a drawing of
large scale, that the angle in this wheel is 51° for the acute angle, or its
supplement 129° for the obtuse angle. The analysis of the wheel is too
lengthy and uninteresting to be given here, but the less technical reader
may be interested in seeing the results obtained by theory. With the
data:
Inside radius of wheel = 2% ft.
Outside radius of wheel = 3}-g ft.
Inside angle of bucket = 51°
Terminal angle of bucket = 13° 17^'
Coefficients of friction ft = ft = 0.10
Head - 138 ft.
The following results were found: •
RESULTS GIVEN BY THE DESIGNER.
Revolutions per minute 250
Efficiency per cent 75
Vel. of entrance into bucket, feet per sec. 22)4
Terminal vel. in bucket, feet per sec. . 769/io
Velocity on leaving guides, feet per sec. 64.3

Angle of quitting, from radius . . . + 23°
Velocity of inner rim, feet per sec. . . 68.3
Velocity of outer rim, feet per sec. . . 81.8
Some of these results differ perceptibly, and we sought, and think we
found, the method of solution adopted by the designers, because the
results found by this process agree almost exactly with those given.


Assuming 250 revolutions per minute the velocity of inner rim is
250 ~&gt;C 2 7r
^ X 2.625 = 68.30 ft. per second; and of outer rim = 81.81 ft. The
bO
triangles for velocities gives for velocity of quitting the guides 64.31 ft.
Vel. of entering the bucket 22.5 ft. nearly. If the ratio of the initial
4 275
normal section of the bucket to that of the terminal be -L-^r = 3.42; then
1.20
terminal velocity in bucket = 3.42 X 22.5 = 76.95. Vel. of quitting rela-
tive to the earth = 19 ft.
Instead of following this plan, they may have used the more rational
one of finding the terminal velocity by some formulae of their own, find-
ing 64.31 ft. and the velocity of the outer rim 81.81 ft. for the assumed 250
revolutions per minute; after which the other velocities would be readily
found in the reverse order from those given above. It is fortunate that
the results agree as nearly as they do with true theory and actual
practice.
The depth of the six chambers being 1.81 ft., the terminal width as
marked on Fig. 1, 1.25 in. = 0.10416 ft. and the computed velocity 85.29
321.25
ft"., the quantity of water flowing through 32 buckets will be "'~—|-
1.81 X 85.29 = 514.58 cu. ft. per sec, and the theoretical horse-power
will be ^A4^LA_^ = 8040 H. P. and the actual 0.834 X 8040 = 6700
o50
H. P. This result involves the supposition that the buckets are full at
the outer end where the width is \% in., but it has already been shown
that the bucket is less at a d where the velocity is also less; hence 514
cu. ft. will not be discharged per sec. In order to realize the 6700 H. P.
a portion of the back vane from / to c should be removed so that the
normal width of the bucket would increase continuously from e. f to c.
To analyze the wheel thoroughly, it should be treated as a pressure wheel
from entrance to a d, and one of " free deviation" from a d to exit; but as
these computations are tedious, and do not yield sufficient compensation for
the labor, we will proceed in another way. The wheel might be made to con-
form to the above analysis by adding to the back vane from adtofe so as to
diminish the width from 1% in. to a proper value. A test of this wheel
gave 5500 H.P. for the capacity. This, combined with our theoretical result
5500
would give the proper width X 1-25 = 1.03 in. By a different com-
putation the writer made it 1.04 in.; which value would give, for the water
discharged 433 cu. ft., for 5500 H. P. This gives the quantity flowing
through the wheel. But there is a clearance of -V of an in. between the


The Technic.
wheel and casing through which water escapes under great pressure. By
computation the writer finds that about 16 cu. ft. per second would thus
escape, giving for the water entering the penstock.
Q = 433 + 16 = 449 cu. ft. per. sec. The computed leakage will be
16
— 100 = 3.56 per cent, of the water delivered to the penstock; or 99.44
per cent, of the water passing into the penstock passes through the wheel,
giving for the efficiency of the wheel referred to the water consumed
83.4 X 0.9644 = 0.8043, or 80.4 per cent.
We make the following abstract of a statement in regard to a test
furnished by Dr. Sellers.
At the time of the test the total head from the surface of the water
above the penstock to the centre of the wheel was
H - 135.113 ft.,
and the water delivered to the penstock per minute was
Q = 26867 cu. ft. per min. = 447.8 cu. ft. per sec,
and the theoretical horse-power of the water,
H. P. = W-S X 135.113 X 62.3 = ^
o50
There was an electrical output of 5335 horse-power; hence the actual
efficiency of the wheel and dynamo combined was
*/=S=o-7785&gt;
or, 77.85 per cent.; and if the dynamo yielded 97 per cent, as guaranteed
by the makers, then the efficiency of the wheel system, including friction
and leakage, would be
77 8^
E = -±£f = 80.26 per cent.,
and the power delivered at the upper end of the shaft would be
H-p-= WW=5,50°-
The head during this test was less than that assumed in the compu-
tation, but if 1.4 ft. for the head due to the velocity in the penstock, be
added, the effective head will be 136.5 ft., which is only 1.5 ft. less than
the effective head assumed. This difference will not affect the efficiency,
but would affect the comparative speed. The speed was not measured,
but was regulated for about 245 to 250 revolutions per minute, and the
experimental efficiency and power involve an assumption; and the theo-
retical computation is founded on the supposition that the wheel is a pres-


33
sure wheel throughout; so that it cannot be said whether a more exact
analysis would agree more nearly with a test experiment, if the data were
precisely the same and the quantities directly measured. As they stand,
the two results—theory and experiment—agree remarkably well. The
indication is—the resistances are less than those assumed, the leakage
greater than that computed, and the" hydraulic efficiency greater than 85
per cent, of the power of the water passing through the wheel.
The volume of water may now be recomputed, and will be

The resistance sheer of steel or iron in large masses is not well known.
If homogeneous, theory indicates that it will be 4/5 of the tenacity of the
material, and experiments indicate that the shearing resistance is nearly
the same as that of the tenacity. The tenacity of mild steel is 65,000
pounds and upward per square inch; hence its shearing strength ought
to be 50,000 pounds at least, according to which the solid part will be
strained to about Vio of its ultimate strength when running steadily and

ECONOMICS OF A DOUBLE TROLLEY RAILWAY SYSTEM.
ELBZAR DARROW, 92.
The street railway system of Cincinnati and its suburbs occupies
rather a unique position in the street railway world. Of the 300 miles of
track and the 600 motor cars in daily operation, there is but one single
trolley line, and this operates over less than 15 miles of track, with less
than 35 cars.
This single trolley road was the first to be equipped electrically in
Cincinnati, and does it not seem passing strange, that a vast system of


The Technic.
double trolley roads should be built up all about it, and not a single
addition or extension be made on the single trolley system?
Other cities have elevated roads or conduit systems using a metallic
return, but Cincinnati alone has developed an overhead double trolley
system.
The first impression a visiting engineer has, is the apparent bulki-
ness of the overhead construction, and he is apt to judge it faulty engi-
neering, but it must be lived with to be better appreciated. Ciucinnatians
are wont to boast of their rapid transit and the reliability of the street
car service.
The greatest objection that constructing engineers have urged against
the double trolley system, is the first cost of copper necessitated. To
counteract this and minor objections, the following advantages display
themselves:
(1) A double trolley or metallic circuit can be wired for a definite
drop of potential, and the resistances of the circuits are stable quantities,
not being affected by the weather or seasons.
It has been found to be a good practical rule, when figuring for a
certain desired drop on a given loop, to consider that the maximum load
has to be supplied at the center of the section.
(2) The insulation of the motor equipments is vastly better protected
and consequently there is less danger of burn-outs in armatures and
fields and the repair bills very sensibly decreased. A single ground on
motor or car-wiring does not prevent service being obtained from the car.
(3) When a trolley wire is down the circuit-breakers at station do not
blow, and thus no interruption of service, however brief, is occasioned
even on the particular block where the break occurs, for by taking a little
run a car may cross the broken space by its own momentum. It is
very seldom that both trolleys break down at the same time, and cause a
short circuit.
(4) A very considerable credit item can be deducted from the cost of
copper necessary for double trolley systems, in the matter of rail-bonding
and track-feeders, necessitated on single trolley roads, and at the same
time we get rid of all electrolytic effects.
The proper bonding and the maintenance of good electrical conduc-
tivity at rail joints is an item of expense that should not be overlooked,
when comparing the advantages of single and double trolley construction.
Furthermore it has been the practice among not a few electricians of
single trolley roads, when figuring the amount of copper required to
produce a certain drop of potential on a given loop, to consider that the
earth return has a resistance of nil.


37
A 60 car road in this vicinity, using a 90flb girder rail, thoroughly
double bonded and grounded, found that the estimated losses under max-
imum load were nearly double what had been figured upon. A series of
experiments showed that three-tenths of the current returned through the
earth and seven-tenths through the rails. A feeder was strung overhead
and connected at frequent intervals to the track, with the result that
seven-tenths of the current now returned via the copper route, and three-
tenths through the track, a very inconsiderable amount returning through
through the earth. Of course I realize that the conductivity of the earth
return varies greatly with the locality and the nature of the soil, yet at
best I believe it to be a very uncertain quantity, varying from week to
week with climatic changes.
Experience has shown that in this locality at least, for the same
transmission losses on double trolley as compared with single trolley con-
struction, the amount of copper required is about twice as much in the
case of metallic circuits as in the ground return. It seems to be a general
impression in the electrical world that this ratio is nearer four to one.
Double trolley construction requires stiffer poles and possibly more to
the mile, as it is the practice to space them 100' apart on straight away
work.
Crossings on the overhead work were for a long time a source of much
worriment, and in general they were bulky and unsightly. The weaknesses
and faults have now been overcome to such an extent, that the crossings
as now constructed are neat and durable.
In making the overhead construction it is advisable to put the insu-
lated portion of crossings on straight or level runs, where it is easy for a
car to pass by its own momentum, thus giving curves and up-grades the
benefit of an unbroken line.
Crossings in the central portion of the city frequently occur, having
1,000 volts tension across the insulated portions; and in the earlier days of
double trolley history, two power stations were often in series temporarily,
caused by the breaking down of the insulation on these overhead cross-
ings, burning out the lamps of cars. This trouble has been entirely cured.
The two trolley wires are kept about 16" apart, a strain insulator
breaking the span wire midway between. This construction gives us
three sets of insulation between the trolley lines, viz.: the insulation on
each hanger, and that of the strain insulator. The leakage in wet weather
is thus reduced to a minimum.
Briefly to recapitulate the pros and cons enumerated above, we find
that the principal objections to the double trolley system lie, first, in the
multiplicity of the overhead wires and second, the greater first cost of a
copper return.


The Technic.
On the other hand we find the following to be some of the advantages
claimed for the double trolley system:
(1) No expense is required to bond the rail joints or to maintain same.
(2) Electrolytic effects are entirely disposed of.
(3) Transmission losses are known quantities and there is no liability
of a poor conductivity being interposed, by a poor or dry soil, or by defec-
tive joints in the rail bonding.
(4) Sanding of tracks in slippery weather does not interfere with the
current reaching the motors, and a car off the track can be manipulated
without a " jumper," so long as the trolley poles can reach the wires.
(5) Increased protection is given to the insulation of motors, and thus
a lessening of repair bills for burnt-out armatures and fields is effected.
(6) A broken trolley line does not interfere with traffic or cause a
short circuit at power house, thereby making reliability of service.
(7) Where a sufficient amount of copper is erected to properly feed
and maintain the voltage on a double troiley system, a very considerable
saving is effected in the economical use of current, and losses due to motor
leaks, poor conductivity in the return circuit, are effectively wiped out. ■
In conclusion, I do not wish to be misunderstood as advocating a
double trolley system under all circumstances, but I believe that it has its
place in the power-transmission world, and that were its good points and
reliability better known among street railway men, it would receive a
more important place, and be given more consideration.
TEMPLATES AND TEMPLATE MAKING.
JOHN C. MOSES, '87.
A modern bridge works manufactures a great variety of building and
roof work as well as bridges, and would be more correctly named if called
a structural iron works. The progress of a job through such a shop may
be outlined as follows: A request is received to bid on certain work.
After securing the necessary information the estimating department
makes a design and figures the probable weight, separating the different
kinds of material and classes of work in such a way as to make it possible
to figure the probable cost from past experience with similar classes of
work and from the known prices of steel and iron. The price being thus
determined, a bid is made and the work secured. The work then passes
into the hands of the drafting department. All additional information
needed is secured by this department—surveys are made when necessary'
and other preliminary work is done. The stock is ordered from the mills


39
and the details worked out and the drawings made. The draftsman also
makes out a construction list and shop marks his drawing. Shop marking
a drawing consists in writing on it a distinguished mark for every piece of
iron, wherever that piece occurs, this mark being the name of the piece.
For example, splice plates will be marked Bl, B2, etc., and all pieces
marked Bl are exactly alike in every respect, and interchangeable. The
construction list gives in its first column the number of pieces, in the next
column the name, and in the third column the size and length of the stock
from which the pieces named are to be cut. Blue print copies of this list
and of the drawings are made and sent to the template room. A card is
sent with them bearing the signature of the chief draftsman, giving the
numbers of the drawings and adding information that may be of use to the
template makers, such as the fact that the drawing sent completes the job,
or that the templates are wanted immediately.
The manufacture of the templates is a part of the work not often des-
cribed and so will be treated of at some length in this paper. Somewhat
different methods are used in different shops. The system here described
is that in use at the Boston Bridge Works and is a more elaborate one
than is generally in use. .
The templates are made in two large, well lighted rooms having very
long and wide carpenters' benches on three sides and level hardwood
floors in the center. The larger of these floors measures about one hun-
dred feet by fifty feet. The benches accommodate two men, one on each
side. Temporary horses can be placed so as to lengthen the benches
sufficiently to lay out flanges one hundred feet long. The edge of the
bench is marked off in feet and inches for approximate work, but each
template maker is provided with a steel tape divided to eighths for all
final measurements. The ring end of the tape is held with an awl when
measurements are made. Short measurements are made with a folding
rule. An augur run by power works at one end of the bench. Around it
are placed horses carrying rollers on which the templates rest while being
bored. Each of these rollers is in a frame that rests on other rollers at
right angles to the top one, thus providing motion in any direction. In
one of the rooms are band and circular saws, a planer and a lathe, the last
for the use of the pattern maker. While patterns are made in the shop
the castings are obtained from neighboring foundries.
Backs are provided along the sides of the rooms on which is stored
the lumber used. This is one-half inch clear pine, planed on both sides.
It is sawed up into widths of four to eight inches for what are known as
flat patterns, and into one inch wide strips known as poles. The lumber
is used over and over again by planing off the old marks and pluggiug up
the holes with sticks sawed to octagon shape and cut up into one-half inch


The Technic.
lengths, then dipped in glue and driven in with a mallet. Poles and flat
patterns are spliced to any length by means of glue. Their edges are
planed straight and square by clamping them to a bench, along one side
of which a steel straight edge some thirty feet long is let in. A plane
shaped to run against this edge is used and the desired result accomplished
accurately and quickly. Chutes leading from the template room convey
the templates to the markers' benches in the shops below. Speaking
tubes also bring the two into communication.
The floors have permanently marked on them a number of lines at
right angles to each other. These serve as base lines. On these floors
are laid out full size all lattice girders, roof trusses, bridge bracing
and similar work. Suppose the work in hand to be a riveted lattice
truss, such as is used for highwav bridges of from seventy-five to
one hundred and fifty feet span. The drawings will give the panel
lengths and heights as they would be if there were no camber in
the truss. A note on the drawing states the amount of camber desired.
The bottom chord panel points are laid off on one of the permanent
base lines and the amount of camber desired is laid off above the line
opposite the center panel point. Distances are similarly laid off at the
other panel points so that the bottom chord panel points lie in a para-
bola with a center ordinate equal to the camber specified. The vertical
height of the truss is now measured off from each of these new points and
in a direction at right angles to the original base line. In this way all
members of the truss preserve their lengths as shown on the drawing, and
the camber affects the lengths of the diagonal members only. No attempt
is made to figure these lengths. The strain lines having all been drawn,
enough pieces of board are glued together edgewise and tacked down at
each intersection to make a place large enough to draw out the entire
joint just as it appears on the drawing. All the rivets are shown, also the
outline of the gusset, and the ends of the various plates and angles com-
posing the truss members meeting at the place. Poles reaching from one
intersection to another in the line of the diagonals are laid on the floor
and marks made across them at the rivet holes drawn on these boards.
Marks on one side of the pole are for one leg of the angle, on the other
side for the other leg. A slanting line across the end of the pole shows a
beveled cut. The rivet gage and size of punch are written on with a tar
pencil; also the name of the piece, the number wanted, and the stock to
be used. The pole thus becomes a complete description of the piece, and
the steel is cut, marked and punched without referring to the drawings.
For the web of the top chord, a board is built up of the width and length
of the plate and all holes are laid out on it and bored. This is done on
the bench. The holes at the intersections are laid out by taking up the


41
pieces of board from the floor and laying them on the plate pattern and
marking through. The top chord angles are made on a pole by laying it
alongside the plate pattern and transferring the marks. If the plates are
wide, the template is made of narrow boards held apart by transverse
battens so as to avoid the effects of swelling and shrinking. The end
posts, bottom chord and verticals are made in a similar way. The top
and bottom bracing systems are laid out like trusses, using the panel
lengths already measured out on the floor. The floor beams and stringers
are made on the bench. The pieces of board originally placed a,t the
intersections are taken up and cut out to the shape of the gusset at that
place and bored so as to become the pattern for that gusset.
The use of poles for angle iron templates is confined to angles that
have only one gage line. The pole is laid beside the angle iron on the
marker's bench and marks made across the iron directly opposite the
marks on the pole. The punches are provided with a gage which is set
for the proper gage of the angle, and the angles are then punched without
further marking. If an occasional hole is wanted at an odd gage, it must
be laid out and centered. When the punch reaches that hole, the gage is
lifted out of the way and the hole punched by the center mark. This, of
course, involves extra work and care and such odd gages are to be avoided
a3 much as possible. If angles are so large as to have two gage lines on
them, a flat pattern is made with the holes bored in it. If one leg is nar-
row, the holes in that leg are given by marks on the edge of the board.
Templates for Zee bars are similar to those for angles except that
three sides of the pole are used for marks. The iron is marked and
punched in the same way as described for angles. Templates for beams
and channels consist of pieces of board containing the different groups of
holes for the connections and tie rods, and a pole with marks across it
opposite the centers of these connections. Poles are made for each differ-
ent beam, but the pieces of board are used as often as the same group of
holes occurs. Bent and curved pieces require more elaborate templates,
and no attempt will be made to describe them here. Templates are made
for pins and rollers, for bolts and tie rods, for everything in fact except
rivets. In every case the template is a complete description of the piece,
and no drawings are used in the shop until the parts are assembled.
When all the templates of the bridge are made they are compared
together on the floor and checked by a checker. All marks on the tem-
plates are shellaced to protect them from being rubbed out. Finally they
are tied up together and sent down the chutes to the shop, while a card is
sent to the shop superintendent telling him what is ready.
A considerable portion of the work of a template maker consists in
getting as many templates as possible on one piece of lumber, and


The Technic".
numerous devices are used to accomplish this. The draftsman must
always have this in mind and arrange his rivet spacing, etc., in such a
way as to aid the template maker to do this. Sometimes a dozen different
columns can be placed on one piece. Holes occurring in one column only
are surrounded with a ring and marked with the column number. When
of varying lengths, notches are cut to show the ends of the pieces. The
extent to which these devices are carried is almost incredible. A few
months work in a template room is a splendid training for a draftsman.
From the template room the templates go to the markers' benches
where they are clamped to the iron and the marks transferred. Then the
iron is cut and punched, assembled and riveted together; columns and
chord members are faced and pin holes bored. The work is painted and
weighed, and loaded onto cars or teams and sent to its destination. There
the erecting gangs take it in charge and put it in place. The templates
are saved until the work is erected, and in case of any difficulty they can
be examined and remeasured and the exact trouble frequently determined.
When all is done the templates are taken apart, marks planed off and
holes plugged, and the lumber is ready for use again.
It can be seen from the above account that a template maker must be
a carpenter and also thoroughly understand drawings. He must be
accurate, for any mistake of his means a spoiled piece of iron or a misfit,
that delays erection and causes expense. Ingenuity and speed have no
place in a bridge works unless accompanied by the ability to do things
correctly day after day; and the draftsman or template maker who has
that ability, and maintains it by steady application to his work, will never
lose his job. When work is brisk, each template maker is provided with
a helper, the helper doing the carpenter work. The work is clean and
healthy and good men are in demand.
Before closing this account it should be said that experience has
shown the great superiority of this method over any method involving
laying out work directly on the iron. It has been proved cheaper to make
a template for a single piece of iron, even if it be of the simplest nature,
than to lay it out on the iron with rule and square. The entire system is
the result of many years experience and was developed by the template
makers themselves before the days of complete working drawings. It is
a splendid example of what intelligent "practical" men can do.

A MODERN ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANT.
ARTHUR FRANTZEN, '93.
It is seldom that capitalists, when contemplating the erection of large
office buildings or factories think oi more than the resultant of an electric
light plant, i. e., the amount of light and power they require for their
purposes.
So much space is set aside for the machinery and the efficiency, future
requirements and economy of space are given slight consideration.
The first question that generally arises when a large building is erected
within reach of a large central station-lighting plant is: "Will it pay to buy
the current from the electric light company or to purchase the machinery
and generate your own current?" There are a large number of conditions
to be taken into consideration before this can be answered ; such as the rate
charged by the electric light company, the number of lights to be installed,
sources of power for generators, opportunity of furnishing light to other
consumers, and value of space occupied by the machinery.
Let us assume a building having 1,000 lights burning an average of
five hours full load and compare the relative cost of purchasing the cur-
rent and of installing an electric light plant to generate your own current.
The rate charged in Chicago at present is 20 cents per 1,000 watts per
hour, with a discount of 2%% to 50% according to amount consumed.
If we use 1,000 lights 30 days, averaging five hours each, our consump-
tion of current would be, estimating each 16 C. P., lamp 55 watts, 1,000 X 55
X30 X 5= 8,250,000 watt hours per month. Assuming the minimum cost of
10 cents per 1,000 watt hours, the cost per month would be 8,250,000X10=
$825.00.
Now let us estimate the cost of generating your own current. 1,000
16 C. P. lamps will require 100 H. P., approximately, estimating 10 lights
per H. P. The total consumption of steam at 40 pounds per H. P. per
hour to generate current for 1,000 16 C. P. lamps, 30 days, averging five
hours each, will be 100 X 40 X 30 X 5=600,000 pounds steam. Assuming eight
pounds of steam per pound of coal, we have 600,000-5-8 =75,000= 37.5 tons
of coal. 37.5 tons @ $3.00=$112.50. To this must be added the services of
an engineer and fireman, cost of oil, waste and sundries and depreciation
of machinery. This would make the total approximately $300.00 for gen-
erating your own current against a bill of $825.00 per month, leaving a
balance of $525 00 per month to apply on purchase of machinery.
For large units an isolated plant is undoubtedly the cheapest method
for the owner and if the unit is small it has been found economical to
install a dynamo, using a gas engine as the motive power. But the item


The Technic.
of space is generally of vital importance to owners. This has been met
by doing away with belts, pulleys, etc., and setting the dynamo and engine
on same bed plate and shaft, and thus occupying a minimum amount of
floor space.
The plant of which I shall give the following description was installed
December, 1895, and is used for furnishing light and power to the stores
and apartments of the Paul O. Stensland building, of which Plate I is a
view taken at noon. Plate II being same view taken at night with all the
lights burning, the third and fourth floors, not being occupied at present.
In Plate III we have a general view of the electric light plant consisting
of two direct connected dynamos and automatic high speed engines.
The dynamo in foreground is a 25 K. W. direct connected to a 83a"X
10" Ball Engine running 350 rev. per minute and the other is 50 K. W.
direct connected to a 12"X12" Ball Engine running 300 rev. per minute.
The rating of engines are 40 and 80 H. P. respectively at 80 pounds boiler
pressure and % cut off.
The dynamos are six pole slow speed, compound wound machines,
manufactured by the Jenney Electric Motor Co., of Indianapolis, Iud.
The fields are made of cast iron with a vertical parting thus allowing
same to be slid aside and free access to both armature and field coils.
The pole pieces are wrought iron fitted into fields by means of hydraulic
pressure. The field coils are wound on bobbins and slip over pole pieces
with compound coils also formed to slip over same. Both are then
secured by screwing cast steel shoes onto the pole pieces.
The armature is drum wound and easily slipped on or off the shaft as
it has a split hub with bore same as diameter of shaft. By simply driving
wedges in each end the armature can be easily moved. This is a very
important feature as a driving fit often tends to spring the crank pin of
engine if crank is not securely blocked.
The out-board bearing is movable and great care must be taken that
same is in exact alignment with the two engine bearings, otherwise the
bearings are sure to give trouble. The brushes are shifted by means of a
rack and pinion connected to hand wheel on out-board bearing.
The dynamos are connected to two three pole knife switches on
board, the outside blades breaking the positive and negative leads and the
middle blade breaking the equalizing cable. This enables the dynamos
to be thrown into circuit either separately or in multiple. When running
in multiple the 50 K. W. takes % and the 25 K. W. % of the load.
The switch board is provided, in addition, with 8 switches connected
to sub-mains marked as follows:


Roof - 255 lights
Milwaukee Avenue Windows -50"
Carpenter Street Windows 250"
Post Office -- 300"
Engine Room and Stores 150"
Arc Lights 150"
Mortors 1-10 H. P 100"
Second Story Store 200"
Total 1,655 lights
The total capacity of the plant, full load is only 1,200 16 C. P. lamps,
but all the lights are never burning at the same time, and should it happen
that such is the case the roof and motor switches are pulled leaving a
total of 1,300 lights, which can easily be carried. The 10 H. P. motor is
connected to a freight elevator and is used only during the day when load
is very light.
Provision has been made on the switchboard with an extra slab for a
third machine of 75 K. W. capacity should future demands warrant same.
All the piping, heaters and pumps, etc. were designed for an excess of 120
H. P. All leads from dynamo to the switchboard are run in iron pipes
below the floor. All cables being lead covered.
The switchboard is furnished with one Weston round pattern volt meter
for both machines. Separate readings are taken of each dynamo by
means of a three point volt-meter switch before throwing them in multiple.
The voltage of last machine thrown in should be two or three volts less than
voltage of the other already connected in circuit, and then proportion the
loads on each machine by turning rheostat handles of each. When both
dynamos are running iu multiple and we wish to shut down one of them,
the best way is to gradually shift all the load on either dynamo by cutting
down the voltage on the other with the rheostat, and you then have very
little sparking in pulling main switch.
Each dynamo has its own ammeter and in connecting same care should
be taken that they are connected on the negative cable as the equalizer
joins the positive cables. If this is not done the ammeter reading will not
indicate correctly the amperes each dynamo is generating when running
in multiple. When running separately it would make no difference to which
cable you are connected. All ammeters of this type are shunt ammeters
and are in reality milli voltmeters calibrated to indicate amperes for
losses in thousandths of a volt across a special resistance in series with
dynamo cable.
When these machines were first started, the large dvnamo sparked
very badly at two of the brushes, while the other did not spark at all. On


The Technic.
investigation it was found that the armature was not central in the fields.
In order to insure myself of this I disconnected the equalizer and ener-
gized the fields from the small dynamo. I then insulated all the brush
holders from one another and started the engine. The voltage was then
taken between the different brushes and the difference was quite marked.
At one pair we had a voltage of 110 and on the other side 104, showing
that current was generated unequally in the armature due to being closer
to fields at one side than the other. We then loosened the field base bolts
and by tapping the fields slightly on one side and shimming on the other
we got the same voltage between any brush and the other five. On con-
necting dynamo into circuit she ran perfectly sparkless.
The plant has been in operation four months and has given very good
satisfaction. An efficiency test was made of this plant and space does
not permit me to give the details but we attained 91% on the 50 K. W.
and 93% on the 25 K. W. In explanation of why we obtained a higher
efficiency on the 25 K. W. than on the 50 K. W., I can only state that it
was probably due to smaller percentage of friction on engine and having
wrought iron shoes instead of cast steel shoes on pole pieces which we
have on the 50 K. W.
As regards the wiring the only special feature is the roof lights shown
on night view Plate II. A 2%" galvanized iron pipe extends the entire dis-
tance around the building and 2-3" tees are connected to same in middle
of each frontage. From these tees two pipes are run through wall into
the attic. The wires are all run in this pipe using one circuit for every
ten lights. Taps are made every foot for a 34" pipe about 14" long screwed
into weather proof sockets. In this we have a perfectly water tight instal-
lation and have had no trouble at all from heavy stormi. The effect at
night is very pleasing and has attracted considerable attention to the
building.
The total cost of the entire electric light plant including engines,
boilers, dynamos and wiring complete was approximately $25,000.
THE DEEP WATER CHANNEL.
GEORGE IRVING GAVETT, '93.
The Deep Water Channel just completed by the United States govern-
ment, connects the navigable waters between Duluth, Chicago and Buffalo.
Its minimum depth, when the water is at its normal stage, is 20 feet; and
the maximum depth of working, 21% feet. The width varies according
to locality. At the foot of Lake Huron is a width of 2,400 feet. In the


47
St. Clair Flats Ship Canal the width is about 260 feet. The work is
divided into sections. That at the foot of Lake Huron being No. 5, St.
Clair Flats, No. 6, Grosse Pointe, No. 7, etc.
At the foot of Lake Huron the work was commenced by establishing
the axial line of the channel by means of a system of triangulation. This
axial line runs north from a point on the Canadian shore until deep water
is found where no further dredging is, required. There was here about
half of a square mile to be gone over and dredged to the required depth of
21 feet. The bottom of the lake is not uniform. The shoalest place found
by soundings through the ice was 17 feet. Then there are other places of
26 or 27 feet depth. Thus the arhount of dredging to be done at different
points was quite variable. The shoals upon which were less than 21 feet
of water ran from N. E. to S. W. and form low ridges along the bottom of
the lake. The removal of these ridges requires but little real work on the
part of the civil engineer. They were located by means of soundings.
These soundings were taken through the ice and at uniform distances in
north and south, and east and west lines. . These soundings were plotted
and contours of the lake bottom then drawn. From these, with the trian-
gulation system established and a stadia survey made during the summer,
a map of the lake bottom was made in connection with the stations and
objects along the shore. With this the inspector, by use of a transit,
oould keep a record of the progress made by plotting the positions of the
dredges every day.
The dredges were set at work in lines parallel to the axis of the
channel, completing a width of 300 feet each for the full length of that
section. There were two dredges at work. One cut a width of 25 feet,
the other 30 feet. The latter being more powerful and having a much
larger dipper, was enabled to do a much greater amount of work in a given
time. Her dipper held about seven cubic yards. She removed sometimes
as much as 1800 cubic yards of stiff clay during the day and 60%' of that
amount at night. She worked at night by electric light, having her own
light plant on board.
As a description of the machinery and working of a dredge would
require the knowledge of a mechanical engineer, I will not attempt an
extended explanation. The power of the engines is applied to the crane
and dipper-arm by large chains running around a drum and over pulleys.
The dredge has three spud anchors. Two at the bow and one at the stern.
These are raised and lowered by chains from the engines. The dipper,
made of heavy steel plate, is of appropriate shape for scooping up the
clay. It is hung to a dipper-arm which slides in a vertical plane through
a swinging crane. In the bottom of the dipper is a door that fastens with
a latch when lowered into the water.


The Technic.
The dredge is towed into position by her tug, lined up by means of
shore ranges, the spud anchors are dropped, and she is ready for work.
The dipper is dropped into the water with great splash and noise. When
the dipper comes up with its load of clay, it is swung over a large wooden
scow and dumped. These scows are of various sizes. Those with the
dredge now being described held about 260 cubic yards apiece. When a
scow is filled it is towed to the dumping ground. They are dumped
througli wing doors in their bottoms.
The dredge itself does not need much description It consists of a
large scow housed over. The house contains the engine room, dining
room, kitchen, office, and inspector's room. The hold of the dredge is
occupied by coal bunkers, boilers, engines, and dynamo.
The crew consists of runner, cranesman, fireman, three deckhands
and cook on board the dredge; captain, engineer and fireman on the tug.
and one scowman. This crew is double, one set for day work, the other
for the night. There are also a blacksmith and a carpenter. Thus the
total crew is twenty-four, besides the government sub-inspector. A crew
of this kind requires a good culinary department. And I found the board
on this dredge to be of as good quality and of greater quantity than that
of the three dollar boarding house of Ann Arbor. The sleeping apart-
ments for the crew were in a floating house that was tied to the dock down
the river. These apartments were occupied by the day crew at night and
by the night crew during the day.
The eutiro work is overseen by the government inspector and sub-
inspector. Tiie sub-inspector is on board the dredge and has duties very
simple though important. He must be supplied with a record book, a
sounding-rod and common sense. Or, "good horse sense," as our worthy
professor would say. The record book is used to record the number of
hours worked, the kind of material dredged, the amount of material
dredged in scow-loads and in cubic yards, the time of dumping scows, the
stage of water level, direction of the wind and any suitable remarks. The
sub-inspector must see that the scows are fully loaded before they are
dumped, or, if for any reason they are not loaded, he must estimate and
record the amount in each. He must use the sounding-rod to ascertain
whether the required depth is reached and that too great a depth is not
made. As the work is paid for by the cubic yard the contractor has a ten-
dency to go to as great a depth as the inspector will allow. For the same
reason he will sometimes under-load the scows if not watched. Here is
where the "horse sense" is of use to the inspector. The clay will stand
in great cakes when loaded into the scow and cannot be levelled down to
make an even scowful. It therefore takes judgment to load the scow so
as to be just to both the contractor and the government. Then, too, in


49
sounding;, the inspector must be careful not to be fooled. As mentioned
above, the bottom is not uniform. There are many holes of a greater
depth than that required. So when the sounding is greater than 21}£ feet
one must be able to tell whether the rod has dropped into one of these
holes, into an anchor hole, or into a place dredged too deep. If the latter
is judged to be the case the inspector must estimate the amount over-
dredged, make a record of it and deduct the same from the amount
dredged. Right here is where the sub-inspector may come into digagree-
able contact with the contractor. I did not have to perform this duty of
docking but once, and then had no trouble whatever. These soundings
are taken with one of two kinds of sounding-rods. One is a straight pole
marked.in feet and tenths, the. other is a shorter pole having a flat lead
suspended from it by a picture wire. This'latter is much easier to handle
and, in my opinion, more reliable. With either, care must be taken that
the marks do not get changed.
The record of the stage of water level is made from a water gauge set in
open water. This guage is marked in feet and tenths. The record is kept
to half-tenths. To one not accustomed to the lakes the change in water
level is surprising. Sometimes it will not vary a tenth of a foot for days.
Then the wind will change and the water will drop or rise a foot or more.
One morning the water suddenly dropped three feet below the normal.
In a short time it was nearly as much above the normal. It then slowly
fluctuated up and down until afternoon. At such a time it is difficult to
dredge to any specific depth.
It becomes impossible to work when there is a high sea. Those of the
men who disliked work were always glad to see a black cloud spread
across the open water to the north. They then knew the north wind was
coming. That meant a heavy sea and no work. However this was not
entirely pleasant, for the north wind also meant a sudden drop in temper-
ature that would chill an inlander through and through. I have seen
extremely hot days in August when the north wind would come and in
thirty minutes people would be hunting their overcoats.
This cold wind is one of the disagreeable things of an Inspector's life
at the foot of Lake Huron. Another disagreeable thing is the constant
noise and jar of the dredge. A few dredges use wire rope for the trans-
mission of power, while the most of them use chains. The noise of these
chains passing over pulleys and around drums is deafening, and may be
heard for more than a mile. The jarring motion they cause is worse than
that experienced in riding over a rough railroad in the way car of a freight
train. It shakes things in every direction, up and down, to right and to
left, backward and forward, and around and around. This may be very
soothing to borne but to me it was decidedly disagreeable.


At St. Clair Flats the work was much the same. Here the Channel
runs from the mouth of the St. Clair river down the ship canal and on out
into Lake St. Clair in a direct line toward Detroit river. In the canal a
width of 20 feet is left on each side so as not to interfere with the timber
work and filling of the canal banks. From the canal the channel flares
until it reaches a width of 800 feet at deep water 10,000 feet out.
The bank of the canal gives a base line about \% miles long. To form
a triangulation system it was necessary to have a station out in the lake.
For this a cluster of piles was driven about 7,000 feet from the canal. To
have made a good system more stations should have been built. As it
was, points along the river docks and the marshes were used as stations.
One of my duties there was to re-read the angles of the triangulation
system. The repeating methbd is not allowed. It is required that all
angles be read by continuous reading around the horizon. I had to use
the stations already provided. These were most of them holes bored in
the steamboat docks, sidewalks, or elevated platform. As such stations
have considerable freedom of movement it became a vexing piece of work
to make triangles close to less than five seconds of arc, as was required.
But "patience and perseverance won success." When this was done I
was instructed to make a map from my readings in combination with the
stadia readings taken the year before. This was plotted by the co-ordinate
system, according to government rule.
As the contractors intended finishing this section that summer, the
work had to be swept for the purpose of ascertaining whether the dredges
had removed the bottom to the required depth. This sweeping was done
by means of iron bars suspended from a catamaran scow. At first the
bars were suspended by heavy steel tubes that slid up and down in a
frame work on the scow. This was immediately found to be a very cum-
bersome and unreliable method. Then the bars and tubes were taken
out and replaced by T-rails suspended by chains running over windlasses.
This was found to work very nicely. The slightest obstruction on the
bottom being easily discovered. When an obstruction was struck the
scow was stopped, the spud anchors dropped and a signal flag run up.
Two transit men, one on the canal bank and the other on the pile cluster,
read angles to the signal flag. The plotting of these angles located the
position of the obstruction. The contractor was required to follow with
the dredge and remove all obstructions thus found. This was a slow,
tedious job. But finally all was finished, reports sent in, accepted, and
the work closed up by the 10th of November, 1894.

HYDRAULICS OF RIVERS HAVING ALLUVIAL BEDS.
GEO. Y. WISNER, '65.
When an engineer has examined the physical characteristics of any
river, and determined its depth, cross-section, slope and discharge, and is
asked why such particular cross-section exists, his reply would probably
be, that the forces of the river currents and the resistances of the river
bed and banks, were in equilibrium for the particular values found.
This would be strictly true; but when we consider the forces which
have acted in producing such results and conditions, the engineer must
admit that he has to deal with'hydraulic laws, of which we have very
imperfect knowledge, and in regard to which much that has been pub-
lished is empirical, and if not wholly erroneous, is often based more on
tradition than on fact. Hydraulic writers for centuries have stated that
the confining of the flood waters of alluvial streams by levees causes their
beds to rise, yet we know, that for any given discharge the slope must be
a fixed amount; and, since this slope always has its origin at the sea
level, any change in elevation of river bed must necessarily disturb the
equilibrium existing between the river forces and the resistances of the
bed.
It is true that the beds of alluvial streams do rise, but the amount
due to the action of the levees is infinitesimal. All rivers, except those
which flow over hard beds with small slopes, have a double discharge—
that of water and that of solid matter carried in suspension.
The volume of this load depends on the depth and velocity of the cur-
rent, and the solid matter is carried forward with each successive flood
until deposited in the sea at the mouth of the river.
This deposit gradually builds up a delta, thereby lengthening the
river by the amount of the annual advance of the mouth of the river into
the sea.
This additional length of river requires a slope and therefore the
river bed above must rise an amount equal to the natural slope of the
river corresponding to the advance seaward.
The average advance of the Mississippi river delta in the past has
been about four miles per century, and, since the mean slope of the river
from Cairo to the Gulf is about four inches per mile, the actual rise of the
river bed during that time must have been about sixteen inches. Ap-
proximately the same rise would have occurred whether the river flood
was confined between levees or not.
The only difference is that, when a complete system of levees exists,
all of the material brought down by the river must pass through the delta,


The Technic.
and would produce a slightly greater advance than when overflows occur
and a portion of the load of sediment is left along the river banks, causing
the natural banks to rise at about the same rate as the bed.
In making a study of the movement of water and sedimentary mate-
rial in rivers, it is very important to bear in mind, that, while apparently
continuous, it is intermittent in volume, and by no means endowed with
all the requisites of a perpetual motion.
All motion is the result of applied force, which in this case is that of
gravity, and the work done is the load carried and the frictional resis-
tance of the bed overcome.
The movement of sediment bearing streams is two-fold, viz: that of
the water and that of solids transported, and the popular idea that the
work performed is the same whether the stream be of clear water, or
gaturated with sediment is wholly erroneous.
If you note the indicated horse-power necessary to pump a given
volume of clear water to some certain elevation, and compare with that
required to raise the same amount when saturated with sand, it will
appear at once that the force expended varies as the specific weights of
the two fluids. The same is equally true in regard to the force expended
by a stream in transporting sediment from its headwaters to the delta at
its mouth.
Some very peculiar phenomena sometimes result from the action of
two fluids of different densities on floating bodies and matter carried in
suspension. One of the most interesting, and until fully understood, very
puzzling, is the so-called "counter currents" at times found just above
mouths of large fresh water streams, discharging across a bar into a salt
tidal sea.
The name "counter current" is given the phenomenon by the pilots
who were often obliged to face a difficulty which they could not explain,
and had to call it something. In fact, when my attention was first called
to the matter, at the mouth of the Mississippi river, I regarded it as one
of those statements especially adapted for telling to the marines. How-
ever, I soon found that the anomaly was very much a fact, and at once
commenced investigating to determine its nature and cause.
At a low stage of the river when the velocity of current varies from
one-fourth mile to one mile per hour, tow-boats with sail vessels in tow
are often brought to a stand still in mid channel, and sometimes move
backward when working with a full head of steam, until the unknown
obstruction is overcome, and then move forward with their usual speed of
eight or ten miles per hour. I have seen powerful tugs with only a single
vessel in tow unable to make the slightest headway, and then without
any apparent change of conditions move on with perfect ease.


63
The only surface indications are slight ripples extending across the
river similar to those produced by a low reef in the bed of the stream. A
careful study of the matter soon led me to the conclusion that the phe-
nomenon was due to the river surface current flowing seaward and the salt
water current on the river bed flowing up stream. Owing to the bar
formation the river is always deeper up stream than directly at the mouth,
and at times of flood tide considerable salt water is forced into the river
down this incline of the river bed.
Fresh and salt water will flow a considerable distance in contact
without mixing to any great extent, aud sea water being three per cent,
heavier than fresh water, passes up stream under the fresh water surface
current.
When the ebb tide occurs the^movement up stream is checked and the
impulse of the increased velocity of current seaward causes the salt water
to roll up in strata of varying thickness such that a vessel floating entirely
in fresh water may have to pass abruptly into a volume of salt water.
Since the buoyancy of salt water is three per cent, greater than fresh water,
the tow is obliged to pass up a slope of Vioo of the draft in the length of
vessel, which is greater than an ordinary tug can overcome with a deep
draft vessel in tow. A vessel drawing 16 ft. would have to be lifted 6 in.
in the time needed to move its length, and since the power expended by
the tug and the friction of movement though faster are in equilibrium for
the speed of the tow, the additional load due to this lift will check the
speed at once. Steamers do not experience this difficulty for the reason
that the action of the wheel destroys the abrupt division of the two fluids.
I have especially called your attention to this particular phenomenon,
somewhat in detail, to emphasize the fact that as hydraulic engineers you
will often be confronted with conditions which are by no means what a
superficial examination would indicate them to be.
We are told in reference books that if we multiply the greatest sur-
face velocity of a stream by a given coefficient, the result will be the mean
velocity of the current. It is very evident that such is not the case at the
mouth of tidal rivers, and in fact, there are many conditions under which
such a process will not even give an approximate result.
These varying conditions play an important part in the action of the
forces tending to deepen the channel or produce deposits in the beds of
alluvial streams.
In the incessant levelling of the earth's surface from the flow of
rivers, the water passes through a continuous cycle, descending from the
mountain to the sea under the action of gravity, and from the sea to the
mountains, by evaporation, action of the winds and condensation. While
this movement is continuous, its fall upon the earth's surface is intermit-


tent, and through the action of periodic floods gives the same character to
the movement of the solids eroded and transported. Every flood brings
down fresh material from the mountains, stirs up sand and sediment
already collected in the bed, carries them as long as the velocity of cur-
rent generates sufficient force to hold them in suspension, and then
deposits them to be picked up by some succeeding flood and transported
to the sea. It is this periodic movement which gives character to differ-
ent alluvial rivers, and produces conditions which tax the ingenuity of
hydraulic engineers to so modify that the river may be rendered navigable
at all seasons.
When rivers have approximately a constant discharge, and conse-
quently very little change of depth, the channels become fixed, and
improvements properly designed will be permanent; but in streams
having great fluctuation of depth, either scour or deposits may occur
when least desired.
The St. Clair river is one of the best examples of a stream of fixed
regimen in an alluvial bed. The fluctuation in level seldom exceeds four
feet, and the change in slope probably never amounts to as much as one-
quarter of an inch per mile. The depth throughout remains almost
constant, and caving banks are of rare occurrence.
There is one peculiarity of this river which probably can not be found
on any other large river in this country, viz: Owing to the fact that the
fluctuation of the surface of Lake Erie is greater than that of Lake Huron,
the slope of the river at low water is greater than at high water (one-
fourth of which is in rapids at head of river); and since velocity of current
depends upon the slope and depth, the velocity of flow at low water is
sometimes greater than at high water. Therefore, in order to determine
the discharge of this river from observations made at a previous time, it
is necessary not only to know the difference in stage, but also the differ-
ence in levels of Lake Huron and Lake Erie for the respective dates.
The failure to apply this principle to discharge observations in the past
has led to some very conflicting opinions relative to the outflow of the
great lakes.
The paths of rivers flowing through alluvial beds is always sinuous,
consisting of curves and counter curves, connected more or less abruptly,
any the beds are a succession of hollows, sometimes near one bank, some-
times near the other, and separated by ridges or bars, of which the form,
height and set vary as the curves one more or less sharp, the slopes
greater and the bed less resisting. These peculiar forms are especially
noticeable at low water, when the river becomes a series of pools, or
elongated lakes, separated by rapids in which nearly all of the slope of
the river is concentrated. It is stated in many works on hydraulics, that


55
the power of a stream to erode the bottom increases rapidly with the
velocity of the current, but in alluvial streams the low water channel
actually deepens during the low stage of the river, and shoals with the
flood stage when the strongest current exists.
This is an apparent disagreement between theory and fact which can
not be harmonized until we fully understand the action of the forces which
excavate the deep hollows in sharp curves and build up the intervening
bars.
The fact that deep channels always exist along concave banks is well
known, but why they exist, and how they are formed, are usually passed
over by authors as an effect of centrifugal force. But since centrifugal
force in this case is a horizontal one, it is hard to conceive why it Bhould
in some cases erode the bottom of the river to ten times the normal depth,
and at the same time have but little eroding effect on the banks. The
cross-sections of rivers in curves are often greater than in the straight
reaches, and consequently the mean velocity less at the point where the
greatest scour takes place. This is an important fact which should be
kept in view in designing works for the improvement of alluvial rivers,
viz: that velocity alone is not always sufficient to produce scour in the
river bed, and the engineer who makes designs with such expectations is
very apt to come to grief.
If we place several floats iD a river above a curve—some surface floats
and others arranged to take the force of the current at various depths, it
will be seen that those near the surface will cross the channel from the
convex to the concave bank while those near the bottom will follow very
nearly the curve of the river-bed. The velocity of the current near the
surface is much greater than that of the bottom stratum and consequently
the momentum of the fluid is correspondingly greater. The surface which
in a section above the curve is level, becomes inclined as the momentum
of the water carries the upper strata of the river against the concave
bank, and produces a pressure through the lower strata from the con-
cave towards the convex bank. Since, as we have seen from the action
of the floats, the tendency of the lower strata is to follow the natural
curve of the river-bed, the pressure of the higher level along the concave
bank will produce cross-currents from the concave towards the convex
shore. That is, a molecule of water after impinging along the concave
bank will be forced down by the pressure diagonally towards the bottom,
and thence across the course of the threads of the current along the river-
bed, thus forming a system of an infinite number of converging forces the
resultants of which are equal to the summation of the elements, and con-
stitute the eroding forces which tear up the particles of the river-bed near
the concave bank and deposit them in the slack water along the opposite


The Technic.
shore. It is evident that these cross-currents must exist, from the fact,
that there is constant movement of the upper strata (which constitute the
main volume of the river) from the convex towards the concave bank, the
supply for which can only come from sub-currents flowing from concave
banks across the bed to the convex bank, giving rise to the peculiar shape
of bed in such sections. The result of this converging action of the cur-
rents is to cause the deepest part of the hollow along the concave bank to
form about twice the width of the river below the sharpest point of the
curve. That is, the downward pressure at this point produces the strong-
est convergence of currents about twice the normal width of stream below.
So long as the curve of the river is such that the momentum of the sur-
face stratum forces it towards the concave bank, the difference in level
forces a return current in the bed towards the opposite shore and causes
the whole river to revolve about a horizontal axis like an immense auger.
When the curve of a river changes direction so that the surface floats
do not have a tendency to impinge against the concave bank, it would be
found that the lines followed by a number of floats differently placed no
longer cross each other—showing converging forces—but diverge, those
farther from the concave bank moving across the river to the opposite
bank and thence down stream until intersected by other deflected threads
and another hollow is then formed by the converging forces. Wherever
the motion of the current elements is converging deep channels will be
formed, and wherever such sub-currents are diverging, shoals and bars
are just as certain to be formed.
Since at times of floods the river is carrying a full load of sediment,
any depression in a bar is pretty certain to be filled up, usually to be cut
away again during low water by the more or less rapid currents over
shoals between deep pools. The building up of bars during the high stage
of river is the result of'this action.
In developing plans for improving the navigable depths over such
shoal the important principle to be kept in view is, that converging cur-
rents during the higher stages of the river will produce deep channels, and
that diverging currents will produce deposits. The main body of the river
must not, therefore, be allowed to leave the concave bank too abruptly,
and by contracting dykes from the opposite shore the fan-like spread-
ing of the currents should be prevented as much as possible. When the
curvature changes the direction of the flow is diagonally across the river-
bed, and a cross-section normal to the movement will be much longer
than the width of the river channel; consequently works needed to deflect
the diverging currents are also necessary to give the proper area to the
cross-section of discharges.
Another very important point in this connection is, that, while certain


curves and slopes will give characteristic iorms to the cross-sections of
the opposite banks, it is equally true that forms of banks have a very
marked effect on the action of the currents in curves. If the resisting
bank has a very gentle slope, the rising water will be disposed of with less
pressure towards the channel bed, the deviation of currents will be hardly
perceptible and the deepening of the bed will be slight. If on the con-
trary the resisting bank consists of a steep slope the pressure of the rising
water is effective in producing downward currents, the deviation of the
converging currents is sharp and the deepening of the bed correspond-
ingly great. This is especially to be considered in designing longitudinal
dykes and jetties for the control of currents of low water channels.
Experience shows conclusively that deep channels may be made and
maintained along the foot of concave banks wherever the cross-section is
smooth and steep, whereas with banks of slight slope the channel will
have less depth and be less stable.
The application of these principles to the improvement of the Brazos
River, Texas, a few years ago, resulted in an average increase of depth of
from 12 ft. to 15 ft., which increase has been maintained without difficulty.
The same principle.is now being used at Aransas Pass, Texas, to control
tidal currents by means of a single jetty.
The impression is quite general that the caving of banks is largely
due to the erosive action of impinging currents in sharp curves at times
of heavy floods. But such is by no means the case. Instead of occurring
at times when floods are at a maximum, caving is much more general
when the river is falling, where the pressure is relieved from the face of
banks, which at high water become so saturated that the sand stratum
sloughs out from the weight of the upper parts, which latter then break
over into the channel and are washed away to be deposited on bars
farther down stream.
If you investigate the lower reaches of any alluvial stream, you will
find that for a considerable distance up stream from its mouth there are
less curves than on the upper portions of the river, and the banks are
comparatively stable. If the caving of river banks was due to the erosive
action of the currents, the most noticeable effect should be near the
mouth of river where the volume of the flow is the greatest, and the bank
formation the most recent. Such, however, is not the case, and in fact,
very little caving is usually found until such distance up stream is reached
that change in level from high to low water relieves the pressure from the
face of banks so that quicksand strata are forced out by the weight of
overlying banks.
If it were not for the difficulties arising from caving banks, the prob-


The Technic.
lem of improving the navigable channels of alluvial rivers would be much
more simple than under existing conditions.
In 1880 the Mississippi River Commission started to improve the low
water navigation of that river, and if we judge from their reports, they
expected, with an expenditure of a few million dollars, to be able to make
and maintain a low water channel of 10 to 14 ft. in depth. Fifteen years
of experiment and the expenditure of forty millions have not yet solved
the problem, except so far as to find out many methods which will
accomplish nothing. The expectation of being able to improve the low
water navigation of the river by contracting the section at shallow places
between pools and thereby to scour deeper connecting channels has failed
to materialize, and in fact such a conclusion should have been reached
witliout the experiment.
Even, assuming that the depth of channel through these shallows
could be deepened so as to give the navigable depth required, this pro-
cess for any great length of river would be ruinous to navigation. The
deepening of any channel will diminish the slope required for any given
amount of flow, and therefore the pool immediately above any improved
shallow will be lowered by an amount equal to the change in slope, which
lowering adds a like amount to the fall between this pool and the next
one above. If the shallow next above be deepened, the pool from which
it flows will be lowered by the entire change in slope below, and conse-
quently this cumulative process will soon develop rapids of such magni-
tude that the engineer in charge will want a new job.
The commission has tried protecting the banks from caving, contract-
ing the cross-section of channel at shallow crossings, confining the flood-
waters between levees at times of freshets, and have now swung around
the circle and are building large hydraulic pump dredges to cut navigable
channels through the bars at times of low water in the river each year.
This move also cannot be otherwise than a failure, for the same reason
as just given, that if the slope across the bars be diminished by deepen-
ing the channel, the accumulation of slope for any great length of river
will decrease the depth on the upper portion of the stream.
The commission are evidently getting into about the same condition
as the young engineer officer, who after having seen his pet schemes for
successful river improvement all wiped out by a single flood, was one day
soon afterward listening to an eloquent preacher describe the horrors of
Sheol. After the sermon a friend asked him what he thought of the ser-
mon as a word picture. He replied, that it was fairly good but it was
evident that the speaker had never had experience with a Mississippi
river flood.

A St. Louis syndicate are trying to lobby a bill through Congress
granting them $1,000,000 per year for twenty years for a guarantee to
maintain a channel 7 feet deep from St. Louis to Cairo and 8 feet deep
from Cairo to Vicksburg, or about two feet greater depth than the average
low water depth under present conditions. The average period of low
water each year is about four months, during which time the amount of
freight which would be carried between St. Louis and Vicksburg would
very likely vary from 100,000 to 250,000 tons. For this freight the govern-
ment, in expending $1,000,000 per year to maintain the low-water channel,
would pay $4 to $10 per ton; from which fact it would appear that it would
be cheaper for the government to pay the entire freight on shipments
during the low-water season, and ship the goods by rail to their destina-
tion.
The engineers of the commission and the St. Louis contractors are
waging a war of words iu regard to who should have charge of the dredg-
ing contract, and expend the $1,000,000 annually for maintaining the low-
water channel. The only result to the general public will probably be
the privilege of paying the bill.
An eminent English engineer has recently Btated in a work on "Tidal
Rivers," that the power of a stream to move bodies along the bottom
varies as 6th power of the velocity of the current, and also that velocities
of 0.5 to 1.25 ft. per second are sufficient to produce scour in river-beds
composed of sand and gravel.
If our American engineers could only find such efficient scouring
forces in the streams of this country, there would be no difficulty in
deepening the channels across the bars, which obstruct the navigation of
nearly all our western rivers. In fact, if these forces should once get
started, it is hard to conceive how we would be able to stop them, for the
deeper we make any channel the less slope will be needed for any given-
velocity, and consequently, unless rock formation should stop the erosion,
the action increasing with 6th power of the velocity might erode deep
valleys across the alluvial plains through which the rivers flow.
The velocity of flow in most of our large rivers at any average stage is
at least five times that given us sufficient to erode sand and gravel, and
therefore we must conclude there is something radically wrong with the
hydraulics of American rivers.
Aside from the action of curves in producing scour in river-beds,
(which has already been stated), the power of any river to produce erosion
and transport material varies with the velocity and inversely with the
depth,—or, since the velocity depends on the slope, the eroding power is
a function of slope and depth. In rivers having hard beds this force is
expended in overcoming frictional resistance, but, when it becomes greater


The Technic.
than the adhesion of the particles in the river bed, scour takes place', and
the material thus torn up is transported down stream until from some
cause the transporting power becomes too weak to hold it in suspension.
From 1850 to 1861 the government engineers made extensive investi-
gations to determine the relation between velocity of flow and the amount
of sediment that a stream will carry in suspension. Their efforts were
made with the idea that if they determined the amount of sediment per
cubic foot for different velocities the problem would be solved. They
finally concluded that no definite relation existed between velocity and
transporting power. They entirely neglected the fact that when a river
becomes five times the depth of the low water stage, material at the sur-
face must be lifted five times the height, and consequently the saturation
of the upper stratum of a stream requires a much greater expenditure of
work that for the lower strata. The amount of work which a river can
accomplish at any given stage depends upon the volume of flow and the
fall; and, since for any given slope, the velocity increases rapidly with the
depth, it is evidentthat for any stated velocity the amountof sedimentthat
can be carried in suspension in a fixed volume of water increases with the
slope and decreases with the depth. A three mile per hour current may
erode hard sand in a shallow stream, and in channels 25 ft. or more in
depth velocities of five and six miles per hour may not disturb very light
sediment. The statements that currents of one to two feet per second
will move sand and gravel is based on experiments made in very shallow
channels, and have no application whatever in streams of greater depth.
The Mississippi river with its wide range of depth and velocities from
high to low water, flows over a bed which is continually rising and falling
under varying conditions, while the St. Charles river, with nearly con-
stant stage of flow, is subject to such slight changes in the navigable
depth that ordinary surveys fail to show them.
From this it would appear that any combinations tending to decrease
the height of floods and increase the low water discharge of a river will
have a beneficial effect on the navigable channel. Unfortunately the vast
area drained by the tributaries of our great rivers make any system of
impounding reservoir practically impossible, and besides, the clearing up
of all the immense forests, and development of tile-drained farms adjacent
to this water course, have changed the natural conditions so much that
the flood water from many rains finds its way into the main river channels
in much less time than formerly, thereby causing higher water in time of
freshets, and shallower channels at the low water stage, thus causing
conditions tending to deteriorate rather than improve the navigable chan-
nels of our inland waterways.
The natural forces which the engineer must control in order to sue-


61
cessfully regulate the navigable channel of an alluvial river are enormous,
and the laws which govern these forces are correspondingly complex.
To struggle against these forces is difficult, expensive and almost
certain to end in failure if the methods used are not in accord with the
hydraulic laws involved.
A thorough understanding of all the physical conditions is therefore
absolutely necessary before any system of river improvement work can be
devised which the designer can safely predict will produce any certain
desired result.
ETHICS FOR ENGINEERS.
CHARLES C. BROWN, 79.
These notes are written from the standpoint of the young engineer
and for prospective engineers, and this fact should be taken into consid-
eration in reading them. Portions are from a lecture to engineering
students on Municipal and Sanitary Engineering. Their fragmentary and
incomplete character is due partly to the condition of the subject and
partly to the fact that they are prepared during busy days.
The profession of civil engineering is very young, especially in this
country, in comparison with architecture, the law or medicine, and has
not yet got away from the former classification with surveying, building,
pharmacy and the like, which are more nearly trades. There is no dis-
tinction between surveying and engineering in the minds of most people,
either in the character of the work or in the grade of intellectual power
and amount of training and study required. This lack of knowledge is
due to the fact that, heretofore, the number of educated engineers has
been small, and most of the work has been done by men who have worked
up through the ranks, beginning as surveyors and gradually developing
engineering ability in the lines met with in business. The number of
educated engineers is rapidly increasing and the old class of surveyor-
engineers is gradually decreasing in numbers. The public education as
to the improvement in personnel and in standing is in a very backward
condition for several reasons. One reason is that the beginning of the
improvement has been so recent. Another reason is that the young
engineer is too apt to take his profession at the valuation of the masses,
and will do strictly professional work as though it were the simpler and
less intellectual work of the surveyor, and at similar prices. Surveying
is simply the tool of the engineer, and stands no higher in the profession
than carpentry does in the profession of architecture, though the engineer
may be a good surveyor also. Still another reason is the habit that too


\
The Technic.
many engineers have formed, owing to the unsettled condition of the
profession, of belittling each other's work and abilities. The young
graduate, even after considerable experience, is disposed to consider the
man who has learned his profession in the field as "no engineer," and is
in some cases correct, but the generalization fails sometimes, and he is too
likely to include all his&gt; fellow engineers in the same class. My experience
may be exceptional, but it leads me to believe that, among engineers of
ordinarily good to poor standing, the, most noticeable failing is a lack of
esprit de corps, an unresisted inclination to pick flaws in the work of all
other engineers, and to belittle their standing in the profession. This
must have its effect in retarding the recognition of the proper standing of
the profession as a whole.
You may have noted in some of the engineering papers last fall a dis-
cussion of the requirement by a city council of a bond from an engineer
for a faithful performance of his duties in designing a system of sewers
which shall be satisfactory to the council; and another case of demanding
a bond from the engineer that a system of heating and ventilation for a
school building will be adequate to the demands made upon it. These
requirements are exactly like demanding a bond that your physician will
cure you, or that your attorney will win your case. I can do no better
than refer you to Professor Woodbridge's reply to the demand for a bond
in one of the November numbers of the Engineering Record. Such meth-
ods of procedure show the dense ignorance of the public generally con-
cerning the engineering profession, its true standing and requirements.
The engineer is thus put on the same footing as the contractor, when
there is as much difference in principle between their positions as between
the architect and the brick layer. The contractor is given a definite work
to do, materials and methods are defined, and he is required to put the
materials together, honestly and skillfully. There is little or no oppor-
tunity for the exercise of judgment by the contractor, except in the minor
details of manipulation, and a bond is not out of place as a guaranty of
honesty of purpose and experience or skill in manipulation of materials
and construction according to plans. The engineer, on the other hand, is
given a problem to solve which demands the exercise of judgment, which
he, by his appointment, must be assumed to have, with education and
information sufficient to make it valuable, especially on the technical side.
His plan, when prepared, is only one of many possible plana, and the
plan he presents is, by that presentation, declared to be in his judgment
the best under the circumstances of the case. To enter into bonds to make
the plans satisfactory to any one, professional or non-professional, is, no
matter what his contention, to confess his lack of faith in his own judg-
ment, for he has put himself under the control of the authority whom he


63
must satisfy. Where this authority is non-professional, the incongruity
is apparent. I can scarcely conceive of it being professional. Do not
misunderstand my position. The reference of the plans to some other
engineer for an expression of his judgment upon them is not condemned,
though there are some objections to some of the present methods of doing
this. Such reference is justifiable by the desire to have the best possible
solution, and the combined judgment of several experts is usually better
than that of any one. What is objected to, is the demand of the contract
and bond that the engineer preparing the plan shall subordinate his judg-
ment entirely to the other authority, even though it may be exactly con-
trary to his own best judgment, or suffer the penalty prescribed. His
work is of value, probably greater than the price he would receive for it,
and should be paid for, whether entirely acceptable or not, or he should
not have been employed in the first place.
Cases have occurred where the first solution offered was not satisfac-
tory, and subsequent solutions have been worked out, independently, or
as modifications of the first plan, until one was secured that was satisfac-
tory, at least in some degree, but where reputable people have been
interested, there has been no question of refusal to pay for work done even
if the plans were not fully acceptable. I know of no cases where the
principle of "no cure, no pay" has been applied or proposed, as flagrant
as the cases under discussion. We call a physician a quack if he offers to
guarantee a cure on such terms, and know that his guaranty is of no value.
We call a lawyer who takes his case on speculation, no verdict, no pay,
very close to a shyster. I can see no material difference in principle in
the case of an engineer.
Many times several almost equally good engineering solutions are
possible, and the final decision as to some details of plan will be made on
other grounds. In some cases these external considerations demand
material departures from the best possible solution from the engineer's
point of view. These questions are rightfully in the province of the cor-
poration authorities, and the engineer could properly be required to make
the plan satisfactory so far as these features are concerned. A bond in
such cases is an evident absurdity. As well bond a lawyer to say or do
nothing detrimental to the interests of his clients. If the engineer has
not standing high enough to make such a bond ridiculous, he has not
standing enough to be thought of a moment in connection with the work.
The engineering profession can not permit the city authorities to shirk
the labor and responsibility which, without question, belongs to them, by
submitting to the requirement of bonds, devised, doubtless, to save the
authorities the onus of a possible failure to select a proper engineer.
When engineers, as a body, refuse to enter into a public competition for
».


The Technic.
work, in response to advertisements for bids, an additional incentive to
this procedure will be removed. As Professor Woodbridge has well said,
the requirement of a bond that the system, as designed, shall be satisfac-
tory when completed, is impossible, from the fact that there is so much
indeflniteness regarding the meaning of the term satisfactory, and that
there are so many modifying elements of change in materials, changes
necessary on account of difficulties met in construction, imperfections in
workmanship, lack of competent inspection, changes in conditions, and
many others over which the designing engineer has no control.
Our profession is too young and its members have too many of them
grown up on the business side of it, to pay sufficient attention to the
matter of professional ethics. The agitation for a system similar to that
among physicians was begun a few years ago. While such a system
would probably be too hard and fast to be applicable, there is no question
that the standard of professional ethics must be raised. When engineers
cease cutting each other's throats, recognize the fact that no man knows
it all, that specialists should be called upon frequently for assistance, and
especially that the world of business will not recognize the standing of the
profession and a proper system of ethics until engineers themselves recog-
nize them, promulgate the system, and stand bv it, the golden days will
be near at hand.
One of the commonest temptations for the young engineer is to
enter into a competition for the work of preparing plans and specifications
for contemplated work, in response to advertisement or solicitation for
such bids by municipal authorities. In such cases he enters into compe-
tition with the less competent class of engineers and their imitators, who
are willing to work at low prices, as their services are not in demand
where their qualifications are known. The ordinary city official, in calling
for such bids, does it in ignorance of the true and safe method of selecting
the competent man after a consideration of the professional standing of
available engineers, and in ignorance of the fact that most of the bidders
from whom he will receive figures are not fully competent to do the work
they propose to do, and are dear at any price; or he does it from laziness,
not wishing to take the trouble to investigate the matter in the proper
way; or he does it to cover a quiet arrangement with some contractor and
his so-called engineer, so that there may be some color for the employ-
ment of the man who can do the most to secure the awarding of the con-
tract to the "right party" at good enough figures to " pay expenses." If
reputable engineers will stay away from such lettings and put them into
as much disrepute as possible, it will not be long until the fact will become
known in all places where desirable work is to be had and the employment


65
of engineers will thereby be put on a higher plane at an early day, to the
great advantage of both individuals and the profession.
There is not room here for many examples of unprofessional conduct,
nor is it my purpose to give them. The principle is what I wish to
emphasize. Much of the lack of understanding of the ethical principles
of the profession by young engineers is due, I think, to lack of knowledge
of the subject and consequent tendency to accept the low position accorded
to the engineer by a large portion of the business world. The wrong start
made by many on this account is not made up for many years, if ever, and
perpetuates the mistaken ideas of the ordinary client. For these reasons
it is very desirable that engineering students should have some informa-
tion on the subject.
Agitation of the question of making the civil engineering profession a
close corporation, similar to that of physician and lawyer, is made periodi-
cally, but so far the difficulties in denning the term, civil engineer, in dis-
tinction from other branches of engineering, have prevented any move
towards organization or attempt at securing legislation. The Canadian
Society of Civil Engineers has recently formulated a code of ethics, but
finds great difficulty in securing the proper legislation to enforce its code
on persons not members of the society, on account of the several legisla-
tures in which it will be necessary to introduce bills. The same difficulty
in larger proportions would confront us in the United States, not to speak
of the difficulty of formulating a code which would be entirely satisfactory
even to any one society of engineers. Sentiment in favor of such a code
is growing on account of the unequal terms of competition under present
conditions of the educated, competent engineer with the incompetent,
who is. willing to work at laborer's wages—all his work is worth. The
opportunity of these self-styled engineers is as stated, the ignorance of the
general public as to the difference between competence and incompetence,
for which ignorance municipal corporations must pay largely on account
of inadequate and defective systems of improvement, which must be added
to or reconstructed with great loss of time and money. The struggle for
bread and butter has led too many fairly good engineers to lower their
standard of prices to compete with this incompetent class, for the purpose
of getting work enough to keep soul and body together. To some such
men the temptation to make up the difference by questionable practices
in the way of indeterminate contracts with chances for large extras, fees
from manufacturers of material and appliances for using their special
wares, divisions with contractors, has been too great to resist. Both the
lowering of prices and the lowering of moral tone are exceedingly demor-
alizing to the individual and to the profession and react to the great
detriment of both. Even membership in the American Society of Civil


The Technic.
Engineers is not guaranty that a man will not indulge in them. Better
keep up a lightning rod for business in the proper way and dig ditches or
run a typewriter for a living meantime, than do engineering work at the
same per diem and permanently lower the standard of one's own profes-
sional services, to say nothing of the lowering of the tone and standing of
the profession as a whole.
A PROBLEM IN HIP-TRUSSES AND VALLEY-TRUSSES.
J. N. HATCH, '92.
The problems in roof framing that a structural draughtsman encount-
ers, while not usually very difficult in theory, are often quite bothersome
in detail, as the solution frequently becomes dependent upon so many
conditions. Just at the moment when it seems a good design has been
worked up, we discover an unlooked for obstacle which shatters our
boisterous hopes, and forces us to so change our design that the very
points we prided ourselves on, as being the best possible, must be elemi-
nated and we fall back on the old tiresome way of doing the best we can
under the existing circumstances. In fact, in building work the most diffi-
cult problems are the little problems; the proper clearances, the best con-
nections, the best spacing for the rivets, etc. And these are the problems
that give most worriment to a young engineer. They are met with so
unexpectedly and are expected to be disposed of as quickly.
The hip-trusses and valley-trusses with their connections to the
remainder of the roof often introduce a number of little problems that
are quite involved and are only solved after considerable hard thinking.
A hip-truss, as the name implies, is the truss under a hip in the roof,
while a valley-truss, or valley as it is usually called, is the truss under a
trough in the roof.
The problem here considered is taken from a similar one occurring in
the U. S. Post Office Building now being erected at Washington, D. C.
The building forms a quadrangle 200 ft. by 300 ft. with a covered court
inside. The roof shown is on one of the turrets, four of which occur in
the building.
Fig. 1 is a horizontal plan of the portion considered, and it must be
remembered does not show the members in the true length. 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 and 6 are the columns which are continuous from the foundation. 1-2,
B.-3, R-6, etc., are the trusses. Truss B is the last one of a number of
sbnilar trusses which extend along one side of the building.
The function of the hips and valleys is to change from a roof with
two slopes as shown by truss B to one of lesser height and but one slope


The Technic.
as shown by truss A. The parallel lines are the center lines of the pur-
lins, which are bolted to the trusses. The trusses are shown in elevation
opposite their respective plans.
In this paper while an actual building has been chosen to illustrate a
practical problem, the discussion will be made as general as possible,
that it may be applicable to any similar case.
The position of the columns will be known. The pitch of the roof
must also be decided upon, and the angles that the hips and valleys make
with the main trusses. In the roof in question as there are three distinct
slopes we may consider the pitch to differ in each. Let the pitch be
defined by the angle the roof makes with the horizontal plane. Let these
angles be 8U 02, 08, etc.; also the angles which the hips and valleys
make with the main trusses in horizontal projection be fa, fa, fa, etc., as
shown in Fig. 1. All of the elevations are figured from the eighth floor as
a reference plane.
Beginning with Truss A as shown in elevation in the right we have
the span oi given, being the distance between the columns 4 and 5. The
pitch angle is also known, therefore the elevation hi will be given by the
equation
hi = ai tan 8j. (1)
This gives the elevation of the point 5 above the eighth floor. Next
we will determine the span a% of the valley X.
Considering the triangle N 5 4 in the horizontal plane we have
N-5 = 4-5 tan fa — ai tan fa
also N-4 = 4-5 sec fa = aj sec fa.
Now N-4 would be the span of the valley if it had been continued to
the point N, but since it terminates in the hip Z at the point O, we must
subtract the horizontal distance N-O.
N 6 = (N-5)—(6-5)
both of which quantities are known.
Also the angle N 0 6 = fa + fa,
and the angle N 6 O = 90° — fa;
therefore knowing one side and the two adjacent angles of tfje triangle
N O 6 the triangle can be fully solved giving the side N-O. Subtracting
N O from N-4 gives the desired quantity 0-4 which equals a,.
Next let us determine the pitch angle 6, for the valley X. Since truss
A and valley X are so situated that the purlins rest on both, and are
parallel to the horizontal plane, the imaginary point N must be at the
same elevation as the point 5 which was shown equal to hi. So the pitch
angle Qx will be given by the equation


6X == tan ~l r —. XT , (2)
nor. proj. N-4
from which value of the angle we can determine the elevation h%, of the
point 0 by
hx = hor. proj. 0 4 tan 6%. (3)
Knowing the span and elevation, the lengths of the different members
of the valley may be readily determined, as in any ordinary truss.
To determine the like properties for the hip Z, we will suppose the
truss B fully solved giving the various distances as shown in the eleva-
tion on the left, Fig. 1.
The horizontal projection of R-6 is given by the equation
hor. proj. E-6 = 02 sec fa. (4)
Again since the purlins rest on truss B and hip Z, the points 6 and 1
must have the same elevation, and the pitch angle 6Z will be given by
a . 1 hz hz hi
ol = tan 17 . ,, „ = — = — (5;
hor.pro]. K-D a, a2
hz being equal to 1h as given in truss B.
It will be noticed that the imaginary point N is much above the point
6, so that a purlin near the top of the truss A would riot rest on the hip Z
but would pass above it. Such a purlin did exist in this roof and a special
bracket was placed on hip Z to support it.
In a manner similar io the above we may determine the hip Y, and
also the point of intersection of hip Z and valley X at 0.
Now having determined the span and rise of the various trusses we
aTe able lay them out. Next let us determine the purlin spacing on the
hips and valleys.
For simplicity, suppose the purlins spaced equally along the main
truss A, a distance apart p\; let us determine the corresponding spacing
along the valley X. Since the spacing pi is along the slant of the roof
truss A, to find the spacing on the valley we will have to pursue one of
several courses. One is to find the angle between the truss and the valley
in the plane of the roof, and multiply pi by the secant of this angle;
another is to get the horizontal projection of pi and multiply it by the
secant of &lt;h and then multiply this result by the secant of 0*; and another,
which seems to the writer much the simplest, is to get the vertical pro-
jection of pi and proceed in the following manner.
Calling the vertical projection of p\ y we will have
y =P\ sin 0! (6)
Now since the purlins are everywhere parallel to each other, and
parallel to the horizontal plane, y will be the vertical distance between


The Technic.
the purlin at every point. And will also be the distance the first purlin
is from the bottom of the truss.
Therefore 6* being the pitch angle of the valley, and y the vertical
distance as defined, the distance from the bottom of the valley to the first
purlin and the distance between the purlins which we will call p+ will be
given by
P* = y cosec. f&gt;T (8)
A similar method would also give the spacing on the hip, if it were
not for a mechanical obstacle which arises here.
Referring to Fig. 1 (a), which is a horizontal section through the
trusses, it will be seen, that if the hips were placed so that the center of
the face of the top chord would be at the intersection of the two roof
planes, the flanges of the top chord members would come in the way of
the purlins. To avoid this it is found necessary to move the hip, as
shown in Fig. 1 (a) from the position shown by the dotted lines, to the
position shown in section; and as the columns are fixed in position the
only way to obtain this result is to drop the hip vertically until the top
chord clears the purlins. Now since the purlins remain in their former
position while the hips are dropped from under them, the space from the
bottom of the hip to the first purlin, and from the last purlin to the top of
the hip will obviously change while the intermediate spaces will remain
the same.
Suppose the hip has been dropped a distance so that the flanges will
just clear the purlins, on the side of the smaller angle which we will sup-
pose is the side 90°—as shown Fig. 1 (a). Let 6 equal the horizontal
distance that the intersection of the hip and purlins has moved out,
measured parallel to the plane of the hip.
Calling half the width of the upper chord t we will have to make b
such that
b = t cot &lt;h (9)
Referring to Fig. 2 we have the elevation of the top chord of the hip,
placed as it would stand in the roof; the dotted lines showing it, before it
was dropped to the required position. The distance b is the same as
shown in Fig. 1 (a). The view above is a plan of the top chord while the
view below is a horizontal projection of this chord as it would appear
when in position in the roof. As every line of the purlin will be a hori-
zontal line, this view will show the center lines of the purlins in their
true length.
The purlins may be one of a number of sections having one or two
rows of bolts, but for simplicity we will consider the bolt line to coin-
cide with the center line in this case.


71
Let the purlin just touch the hip at the point A, so it will overhang a
distance AB. To provide for a bearing for the purlin, a cast iron block of
proper shape, is placed under the end of the purlin, as will be discussed
later.
Suppose the boUs are to be placed normal to the face of the top chord,
from such a point in the purlin that they will intersect the top chord on


The Technic.
the gauge line. It is desired to locate this bolt hole from the bottom
of the truss. Following the same line of argument as was used in the
valley, py as shown in Fig. 2 is given by
py = y cosec. 9y; (10)
y still being the same value as was at first assumed.
It will now be necessary to determine the additional distances r and
d as shown in ttie figure.
From equation (9), b = t cot &lt;h
In the triangle B M A the angle B A M is equal to 8y therefore
B-M = B-A tan 6y = b tan 0y
And in the triangle MBS the angle M B N is equal to "y and we have
M N = r = B M sin 0y = b tan 6y sin 0,
which gives the amount necessary to add owing to the hip having been
dropped.
Again since the angle B A N is equal to 0y we have
6 cos 0, = /
also -—- — tan a
or a = tan~,z—-—— (11)
b cos oy
which gives the angle between the center line of the hip, and the projec-
tion of the purlin center line on the face of the hip.
Also from the figure g cot a = d
ord = ^ = ^LA (12)
Therefore the distance from the bottom of the hip to the first hole will
be equal to r X p, X d as given. The distances between the intermedi-
ate purlins will be p, as in the valley. If the distance from the last
purlin to the upper end of the main truss were also equal to the inter-
mediate distances we would have the corresponding distance in the hip
from the last purlin to the top equal to py — d — r. It is plain th it if the
h p has simply been dropped vertica'ly the slant height has not changed,
so we must subtract from cne end what we added at the other.
Next supposi g the purlin to end at the point B, let us determine the
distance n, as shown in the lower view, Fig. 2, from the end of the purlin
to the first hole.
From the figure, c = d sec Sy from which we can determine c. Also
from the lower view


73
-2- = tan 0
c
which gives us the angle 8.
And n the desired distance along the purlin to the first hole is found
from n = csec 0.
It will be seen that Fig. 2 also gives a complete graphic solution for
the problem which may be determined very accurately if drawn to a large
scale. The method of laying out the proble n graphically is as follows:
In Fig. 1 (a) suppose fa is the lesser of the two angles. "With a hori-
zontal section of the upper chord of the hip we may determine by trial
the position necessary for clearance. It must be remembered that this is
not a right section, but a section made by a horizontal plane, when the
hip is in its proper position in the building.
An easy way to do this is to cut this section full size out of heavy
paper and move it along the projection of the center line of the hip, until
it just clears the purlin. We can then scale the distance 6 exactly.
Next draw, the upper chord of the hip making an angle By with the
horizontal, Fig. 2. Through any point A draw the horizontal line AB and
lay off the distance A B equal to 6.
Above this as shown draw a plan of the top chord. Through the
point B draw the line B-N perpendicular to A-N and continue it to the point
O. 0 will be the projection of the end of the purlin on the face of the top
chord. From A draw the perpendicular A P. Since the purlin just
touches the hip, P will be a point on the purlin. A line drawn through
0 and P will be the projection of the purlin on the plane of the face of
top chord.
Draw R S, the gauge line for the given sections; where this crosses the
line O P will give the proper place for the bolt hole. Dropping a perpen-
dicular through this point on A N gives the point D. And since we sup-
pose the bolts are to be placed normal to the truss, C will be the point on
the purlin where the bolt hole will be found.
Let fall the verticals B E and A G as shown. A line passed through
E and G will be the real horizontal projection of the purlin. From C drop
the vertical till it intersects the line E G at F. E F will then be the dis-
tance from the end of the purlin to the first hole, in its true length.
The method of determining ps and r graphically needs no explanation.
To determine a cast block that tlie purlins may rest on, it will be seen
that a right section of such a block would be a triangle with B N for its
altitude and 2t for the base. The length of the block would be not less
than A N.
In the case where there are two rows of holes in the purlins, or in the
truss, or in both, the solution will be longer, but as there are no new
principles required it will follow readily from the above.

2°. Conical bottom:—The size of the bars of cone being fixed, it
remains to determine the angle 6 which any element makes with the ver-
tical. A normal section at any point cuts out a conic section. The radius
of curvature at the vertex of this section will be the length of the normal
from this vertex to the axis of the cone, and, as the tension in a vertical
joint varies with this radius, the thickness of the plate will also vary
accordingly. An increase of O will make the cone flatter or of less depth
and area. But an increase of 6 will increase the radius of curvature at
any point and hence the thickness of metal as secant 9. The surface =
circumference of base X % slant height, which latter, varies as 1 4- sin 6.
The amount of metal will therefore vary approximately as 1 -f- sin 6 cos
9, and will be a minimum for 9 = 45°. The section by a normal plane
will then be.a parabola. The tension at a point in any vertical joint will
be the product of the radius of curvature into the water pressure at that
point. This tension will determine the thickness of the ptate.
The stress in any horizontal point equals the tension which when
resolved vertically will be sufficient to sustain a load equal to the cylinder
of water above the joint plus the water in cone below the joint and the
weight of that portion of the cone.

At point of attachment of cone to circular girder stress = 24543 -j- cos
45° = 3470.4 lbs. per in. Vertical load carried by girder = 2460 lbs. per

Circular girder, 40 ft. diameter, to be carried by six posts—continu-
ous over same. Maximum bending moment occurs over the post, as
does the maximum torsional moment. Providing for both, we get a

employed, convenience of attachment on the one hand and the desire to
keep the radius and hence the thickness of bottom down on the other, led
to the choice of the angle just mentioned. There results a % in. plate for
the stress at bottom of 3000 lbs., all other stresses coming between that

Spherical bottom and circular girder 77100 lbs.
So far as actual weights are concerned.
The flat bottom requires no shaping, but the rivets must be counter-
sunk. The girders are straight, the beams of ordinary sizes and easily
procurable. The angular connections are special but alike.
There is more riveting necessary in the conical bottom. The stress
in one set of joints is greatly in excess of that in the other set. There is
a large compression in the girder flange, and this girder must be erected
in parts and strongly spliced. The conical plates require careful and
varying curvature.
The plates of the spherical bottom all have the same curvature. The
stresses are small. The thickness is constant. The same size of rivets
and the same pitch is used throughout. The lateral compression on the
girder is much less, and the connections are somewhat lighter and simpler.
As regards inspection, painting and repair, the conical and spherical
bottoms are superior to the flat bottom.
The circular girder takes the place of the lowest course in the side of
the first tank. The spherical and conical bottoms add to the tank capac-
ity. Their appearance is good, as they dispense with the network of.
beams and girders.
Taking into account the saving in material, the smallness of stresses,
the neatness of design and comparative ease of shaping plates of uniform
thickness to one curvature, we prefer the spherical form for a tank bottom.

LAKE FRONT IMPROVEMENT, CHICAGO, BY THE ILLINOIS
CENTRAL RAILROAD.
GEORGE B. SPRINGER, '90.
For many years the question of ownership of land along the lake front
in Chicago has been the cause of disputes and lawsuits almost without
number, between the Illinois Central Railroad and the city or the state of
Illinois. The long contested suit between the state and said railroad was
settled over a year ago by the supreme court of the United States in favor
of the state, confining the right of way of the railroad to 200 feet in width
along the lake front. It remained for the city to come to some agreement
by which the railroad should occupy certain ground, to which it had never
obtained title, and in return give up to the city some ground which it had
made by filling in the lake. A plan for the building up a park was also to
be considered in connection with the settlement of the above mentioned
questions. Accordingly an ordinance was passed by the city council last
October under the terms of which the Illinois Central is at present carry-
ing out its part of the agreement.
This includes briefly the following:
1st. Lowering the grade of their tracks along the lake front about
four feet for a distance of about one mile.
2d. The building of a retaining wall about fourteen feet in height on
each side of the right of way from Randolph Street to Park Row, a'dis-
tance of about one and one-quarter miles.
3d. The building of a bulkhead running approximately parallel with
the present shore line and about 1,300 feet therefrom for the purpose of
retaining filling for the proposed park.
4th. The furnishing of 200,000 cubic yards of filling in the old lake
front park in order to make a gradual slope up to the top of the retaining
wall at the right of way.
5th. The building of four viaducts over tracks to connect old park
with the new addition.
The lowering of the tracks is being done by throwing out of use two
tracks at a time and excavating around and under them, the earth being
thrown on flat cars and hauled off, In this manner traffic is not delayed
and as soon as two tracks are down to grade trains are run over them, and
the next two lowered and so on. About ten tracks are to be lowered in
this manner.
The retaining wall is being bnilt of squared rubble masonry on a con-
crete foundation four feet deep. The section of the wall is approximately


79
eight feet in width at the bottom and two feet at the top, being slightly
battered on the face towards the tracks, with a plain slope on the back
side.
The bulkhead is to be made by driving two rows of piles 30 feet apart,
which will be properly walled and sealed on the inside with Wakefield
sheet piling made from three-inch oak plank, the whole to be securely
tied by iron rods. Filling will be done first between the two rows of piles
thus making a substantial sea wall to retain subsequent filling for the
making of the park. Two openings about 100 feet wide will be left in the
bulkhead or sea wall for the egress of water and will be finally closed up.
The filling of the new park proper will be done by the city, material
being dumped from scows, with dredgings from the river or the excava-
tions from the drainage canal. Street cleanings will also be used for the
purpose.
The furnishing of 200,000 cubic yards of earth filling in the old park
as before mentioned is to be done by the railroad companv. The old lake
front park extends from Randolph Street to Park Row, between the rail-
road and Michigan Avenue being about 400 feet in width. This will have
to be filled to the top of retaining wall, making an average fill of about 10
to 12 feet, running down to nothing at the street level. This filling has
been carried on all winter by teams hauling in debris of all kinds. Mate-
rial will be also brought in by trains later on.
The viaducts to be built connecting the old park with the new addi-
tion will of course be of steel and of a construction which will of necessity
admit of the proper headroom of about fifteen feet, and at the same time
have some pretence to ornamentation. Such a result will be brought
about by making the viaducts shallow, deck plate girders suitably arched
or curved, including some architectural iron features, and surmounting
the whole by an ornamental railing, probably of terracotta. The roadway
will be of asphalt and sidewalks of cement.
When the work now under way has been completed the city will have
obtained about 161 acres of new land for park purposes, or between three
or four times as much more than the present park includes. The city
will also be free from all danger of encroachment by the railroad company
upon its land. On the other hand the company will have its right of way
bounded and confined by two stone walls, said right of way being granted
by the city in perpetuity and all disputes and lawsuits will be settled for-
ever, thus according to both parties long needed and much-to-berappreci-
ated relief and benefit.

FACTORS IN THE COST OF STEAM MAKING.
M. E. COOLEY.
In many manufacturing industries the cost of power is a principal
item in the total expense of producing an article for the market. Water
and fuel are the common sources of our power supply and the steam
engine is the usual means of converting the fuel energy into a form con-
venient for use.
A vast amount of thought has been given to perfecting the different
prime movers. The efficiency of the water wheel has been increased
nearly three times and that of the steam engine six times since our Revo-
lutionary war. Practically, with the steam engine eighty years were
required to reduce the steam consumption per horse power hour from 60
or 70 pounds to 30 or 40 pounds. Twenty years more were required to
again halve it and during the past ten years it has been reduced from 15
or 20 to 10 or 12 pounds. This truly remarkable progress is scarcely
known and but little appreciated outside the steam engineering profes-
sion. The most of this progress must be credited to improvements in the
use of the steam in the engine. Further gains, small in amount, must
be effected by careful attention to the little losses which only appear
important in the aggregate.
The problem of steam using has been so well solved that we should
now devote our attention to the problem of steam making. The highest
results can only be expected when both engine and boilers are operated
under best conditions. The more agreeable surroundings of the engine
often result in neglect of the boilers and unconsciously, perhaps, in
reducing the economy of the entire plant.
The cost of steam making is made up of several factors, the more
important being location of boilers, condition of boiler, draught, condition
of setting, radiation losses, skill of the fireman, quality and price of fuel.
The boiler should be placed in a light, airy and roomy building
separated, if possible, from other buildings; here they may be operated
and maintained to the best advantage at all times. It is too much to
expect the same care to be given boilers placed in out of the way and
inaccessible places frequently contracted to such an extent as to utterly
preclude proper manipulation, examination or repairs. It is an important
factor to locate the boilers well.
A clean boiler is very important in keeping down the cost of steam
making. The owner of a steam plant should not hesitate to provide the
appliances needed to remove from the feed water all scale forming matter.


81
It is much easier and more economical to prevent the formation of scale
by purifying the feed water before it enters the boiler than to remove the
scale once it has formed in the boiler. Tests have shown with a clean
boiler an evaporation of from 7 to 8 pounds of water per pound of coal,
while with one-eighth of an inch of scale the evaporation was reduced to
from 4 to 5 pounds of water per pound of the same coal. The cost of steam
production was by the scale nearly doubled. The scale and soot that
accumulate on the fire side of the shell and tubes cannot so easily be
prevented. It should be removed at frequent intervals by scraping the
surfaces when possible or by thorough brushing with brooms or metallic
brushes and blowing with steam jets under high pressure. Often this
work is done so superficially as to be of but slight service. The arrange-
ments for cleaning the fire surfaces should be as convenient and perfect
as possible, and the work should be done systematically and in such a
manner that the soot as removed will not lodge on surfaces already cleaned.
It is well to increase the draught by steam jets when cleaning the flues,
if the chimney draught is weak, so as to carry the soot out of and away
from the boiler.
The draught is an important factor in the cost of steam production.
A draught suitable for one coal may not be suitable for another coal. A
fine coal requires a stronger draught than a coarse coal. Ordinarily a
chimney should not be less than 80 feet high for the better grades of coal
and it should be at least 150 feet high for the poorer grades. A chimney
should be large enough to burn the required quantity of coal easily. Each
boiler should be provided with a flue damper easily manipulated at the
front of the boilsr. The fireman should not be required to go away from
the furnace for this purpose. A good fireman will regulate the draught
witli the flue damper to suit his coal and to meet the demand for steam.
The brickwork about a boiler should be maintained perfect. All
cracks admitting air should be stopped. The entering air not only cools
the boiler but reduces the draught, and sensibly effects the economy.
Cracks are apt to develope in a new setting, and it is well to have the
masonry refinished after the boilers have been under steam for several
days; the top of the setting may be plastered with strong cement mortar
to give a smooth finish easily kept clean and to prevent disturbing the
brick when working over the boilers. Whitewash applied to the walls
will serve to stop the finer cracks. All doors in the setting should fit
closely; the faces and seats may well be planed.
All parts of the boiler not covered by the brickwork should be care-
fully clothed with a non-conducting covering. This also applies to the
steam pipes, valves and fittings. The sheet coverings are better than
those applied as cements. Exposed surfaces may condense from one-


The Technic.
third to one-half pound of steam per square foot per hour, or more if
exposed to air currents. A good covering one inch thick will reduce this
loss 80 per cent. Assuming 100 square feet or exposed surface for a 100
H. P. boiler, the loss by condensation may equal 50 pounds of steam per
hour, 1200 pounds per day of 24 hours, or 432,000 per year of 360 days. If
one pound of coal produces seven pounds of steam this represents nearly
31 tons, or say $75. Eighty per cent. ($00) of this may be saved with a
i.rood covering. $60 represents the interest on $1000 and the 100 square
feet of covering should not cost to exceed $15 or $20.
No factor is more important to the large consumer of steam than that
&gt;f the fireman. The owner of a steam plant rarely appreciates the fact
rhat a large amount of money in the form of coal is being handled by the
irrimy fellow with shovel and slice-bar in the fire-room. The hours of
work and the responsibilities of the fireman may easily be greater than
those of the more favored help in the office. Too often the former is
employed on the assumption that anyone can shovel coal into a furnace
while the latter must come not only highly recommended, but with
■xperience as well. A fireman should be a trained and skilfull man,
■areful and without a trace of laziness, trusty and appreciative of his
employer's interests. Such a man can not only save more than the
increased cost of his labor, but he will render more satisfactory service
with greater safety, fewer repairs and less depreciation of plant. The
difference between skilfull and unskilfull firing is aptly illustrated by the
following results obtained with the same coal under the same boiler per-
forming the same service, the tests being made within three days of each
ither: with the skilfull man the evaporation per pound of coal from and
it 212° F. was 11.83 pounds of water, and with the unskilfull man the
"vaporation was 7.99 pounds. To make this amount of steam the unskil-
i"nll man used 48.13 per cent, more fuel, which on a fuel basis for the year
■if $2000 represents $962.30 or more than twice his wages.
Equally important is the matter of fuel. Its selection is often attended
by an ignorance which is in painful contrast to the intelligence exhibited
n the work for which the fuel is used. Coal of low price does not neces-
sarily result in a low cost of steam. An important matter involved in the
-election of coal is the freight. Coal delivered on the cars in this city for
•2.20 per ton costs 65 cents at the mines. Obviously with a freight rate
if $1.54 per ton it may not pay to buy an inferior grade of coal for 30 cents
it the mine or to pay freight on a grade which costs practically nothing
at the mine. It follows that the higher the freight charges, the better
should be the grade of coal. The most suitable coal for Toledo is not
necessarily the best for Ann Arbor, nor is that for Ann Arbor the best for
other towns in the interiorof the state where the freight charges are higher.


83
The best way to select a coal is to test it in actual use under the
boilers. For this purpose a sufficient quantity of each of the coals offered
should be purchased to last several days. The feed pipe of at least one
of the boilers should be supplied with a reliable water meter. The meter
should be arranged so that it can be tested from time to time. A ther-
mometer cup should be inserted in the feed pipe near the meter, and
during the tests the temperature of feed water should be noted at half-
hour intervals. The steam pressure should be maintained nearly con-
stant although this is less important than the feed temperature. A plat-
form scale to weigh the coal completes the apparatus.
The test should be at least ten hours long; it may be started and
stopped with a very light clean fire. The conditions of starting and stop-
ping should be the same for all coals. The number of pounds of water
actually evaporated per pound of coal should be reduced to an equivalent
evaporation from and at 212° F. which may be easily done with a table of
factors of evaporation contained in any good mechanical engineer's hand-
book. With the result thus obtained find how many pounds of coal will
be required to evaporate 1000 pounds of feed water and multiply this
number by the cost of one pound of coal. The final lesult will be the cost
of evaporating 1000 pounds of feed water from and at 212° F. and this may
be used as a basis of comparison.
Example.—Coal burned = 3000 lbs., water evaporated = 432 cu. ft.,
average steam pressure = 80 lbs., average temperature of feed water =
49°. Weight of 1 cu. foot of water at 49° = 62.41 lbs. Total weight of
water = 26,961 lbs. Actual evaporation per pound of coal = 8.987 lbs.
Factor of evaporation, feed water at 49°, steam pressure at 80 lbs., —
1.2046. Equivalent evaporation from and at 212° = 10.826 lbs. Number
of pounds of coal to evaporate 1000 lbs. of water = 92.37. Cost of 1 lb. of
coal at $2.83 per ton = 0.1415 cents. Cost of 92.37 lbs. of coal = 13.07
cents equals the cost of making 1000 lbs. of steam.
Tables I, II, III and IV have been prepared in this way for illustra-
tive purposes and show the cost of making 1000 lbs. of steam in four dif-
ferent cities for each of several coals. The names of the coals are for
obvious reasons omitted, capital letters being used to designate them, and
the prices per ton are only approximate. Only the data required to obtain
the results in the two last lines are given.
In Tables I and III all the results are obtained from actual tests.
Table II is derived from Table I except for coal G which is obtained
directly. In Table IV the results for coals M, N and O are obtained from
actual tests the others being derived from Tables I, II and III.
Table I shows that of the three coals A, B and C at the same price,
B is 10.7% more economical than A and 20.6% more econemical than C.

A and B are from the same county in one state and E is a lump coal and
F a slack from the same mine in another state. F is 30.4% more economi-
cal than E, the next best, and should be selected for use at Racine.
Table II shows that B which was fourth at Racine is first at Grand
Rapids and that it is 3% more economical than F winch was first at Ra-
cine. E which was second at Racine is sixth at Grand Rapids and D
remains unchanged in the third place.
Table III contains results for a different type of boiler and only one
coal C which appears in Tables I and II. This coal which is third at Ann
Arbor was sixth at Racine and fifth at Grand Rapids. H coating 7.9%
more per ton is 11.9% more economical than C. Of the two coals J and
K at the same price per ton K is 33.3% more economical to use.

♦Deduced from data furnished by Dr. A. K. Hale, Receiver, A. A. Water Co.;
tests made by their engineer, Mr. R. Spokes.
Table IV shows B again m the fourth place, the same as at Racine,
while it was first at Grand Rapids. C is fifth, the same as at Grand
Rapids, while at Racine it was sixth. D is now sixth while at both Grand
Rapids and Racine it was third. G which was seventh at Grand Rapids
is second at Toledo. N which stands first is a slack coal and like F at
Racine is from a neighboring mine. B which costs 22% more per ton
than K is in reality only 4.9% more expensive to use ; again B which costs
25% more per ton than C shows less than 1% difference iu use.
These results go to show that the selection of coal should be made
with great care. Such a plan of testing coals as outlined will not be so
important in those industries where the fuel cost is known per unit of the
article manufactured.

PLANE TABLE.
J. B. DAVIS, '68.
1. The Plane Table is a drawing board in connection with suitable
devises for setting, and keeping, it level. The alidade is a straight edge,
called the rule, and a line of sight. The line of sight is sometimes the
edge of the n le, sometimes the line of a pair of compass sights set in the
line of the edge of the rule, or it may be the line of sight of a telescope so
mounted upon the rule that this line of sight revolves in a plane at right
angles to the lower face of the rule. When a telescope is used the plane
of revolution of its base line of sight is set pa.allel to the edge of the rule,
or to contain the edge of the rule.
2. In the ordinary use of the Plane Table, a piece of paper is fastened
on the board and the lines surveyed, and points that are determined, are
platted at once upon the paper. A good quality of drawing paper is com-
monly used. This paper may be fastened on the board in a variety of
ways. If it is to remain there long, and the board is well shrunk, it may
be best to shrink it on and stick the edges fast with mucilage. It may also
be tacked down with very small curtain tacks. Thumb tacks are used.
Clamps are used, and rollers beneath the board are used to some extent.
If the paper is larger than the board fasten the edges beneath the board.
If the paper is so large as to be shifted from time to time to receive the
extended drawing it may be rolled and fastened beneath the board by
thumb tacks or suitable clamps. In such a case the part of the paper on
the top of the board should be tacUed fast to prevent any shifting. When
the paper is rolled under the board, the roll, or rolls, and the part of the
paper where it passes over the edge of the board should be protected by a
covering of stout paper. It is difficult to keep the paper clean. When
the scale of the map is small, so that but a small place on the paper needs
to be exposed at once, a newspaper may be lightly fastened over the paper
on the board and torn away in small pieces to uncover the spots needed
for use at any time. After a place is finished and no longer needed it may
be covered again with newspaper, or the newspaper covering may be
changed at times, and the openings in it made to fit the work. In some
kinds of work an extra sheet of paper may be useful for hiving down lines
upon, or for solving certain problems, connected with the work, which
ought not to go upon the map or plat.
3. Center of the sheet. The plane table should be set up over an
instrument point in the same manner a transit is with a plumb bob from
its center standing over the mark. The observations are then taken from


the center of the sheet. The center of the sheet is that point on the paper
which does not move when the board is turned about its spindle axis.
This point may be found on each sheet, or a hole in the board made to
mark it. To And the center of the sheet revolve the board on its axis and
mark four fine marks on the board near its corners by a pencil or needle
held by a fixed support. Find the center of the circle of which the four
marks are a oart of the circumference. To do this the board may be taken
off of its spindle and placed beside another board and so longer ranges be
obtained in drawing the lines to the center. Draw all four lines. They
should intersect at the same point. If they do not, try again. Having
found this center on the board itself, a piece of brass may be.set in the
board with a hole in it to permanently mark the center. When a paper
is fastened on the board a few trials with a needle will prick a hole in the
paper corresponding to the hole in the brass plate. The hole in the brass
plate may be of the size to receive a common brass pin, which being set
firmly in the hole may be a very useful aid in placing the alidade, when
sighting. The center of the sheet should be found for use on ever}' sheet
or every time the sheet is shifted. The hole in the brass plate should be
tested for position occasionally, to see that it stays in its place. If, for
any reason, the connections of the board to the spindle are separated from
the board, this test should be made when they are restored.
4. Articles for use with the Plane Table.
1. Two good triangles, 30°, 60°, 90°, from 9 to 12 inches, according to
the size of the board, and the scale of the map. These may be
of metal, rubber, celluloid, or wood, but should have straight
edges. A place to keep them in may be made under the board.
2. Three legged dividers, with the third leg running through a tubu-
lar clamp, so the third leg may be varied in length, or removed.
3. Lead pencils, of the grade of No. 4 or 5 red hexagon Faber.
4. Erasers—typewriter, velvet rubber, and sponge rubber.
5. Scale of equal pa-its for laying off distances.
6. Thumb tacks.
7. Curtain tacks—No. 1.
8. A little of Higgins' Drawing Board Mucilage.
9. Rubber cloth. A piece to cover the board and contents and fasten
beneath it for protection from rain, and dirt. Some may prefer
two pieces, or one piece and a bag, the second piece or the bag
being for the alidade.
10. A haversack, or better, a skeleton coat to carry the various tools
and articles in. Even an article on the principle of a mechanic's
apron with pockets on its front, is good. The skeleton coat is
best. *


The Technic.
11. For some work, a compass needle in a box. The box lias a square
or rectangular base with the edges beveled like a rule and par-
allel and perpendicular to the zero line of the compass ring.
The compass needle is sometimes mounted on the rule of the
alidade but the separate compass is better.
12. Adjusting pins, common pins, needle pricker, and reading glass.
5. Setting up the Plane Table. Take the table and tools to an instru-
ment point where it is desired that the table shall be set up. Lay the
alidade and other tools in a sale place. Tie on the plumb bob. Set the
table, with its tripod, centrally over the mark of the instrument point.
Spread the tripod legs so that when the table is finally set it will come at
the elevation of the bend at the middle of the body of the person who is
to, use it. Crowd the legs into the ground till the table will stand firm,
and the plumb bob center the mark. The table is usually set too high.
The arms are rested on the board, or the clotiies rub against it, thus stir-
ring it from its proper position. By setting it down to the bend in the
body, one can lean over it more conveniently to look through the telescope
or compass sights. Having attended to the placing of the table, stand
the alidade centrally on the board, a urn the board, or the alidade, till
the bubble tubes are parallel to the levelling screws. By operating the
levelling screws make the bubble tubes both read level. Place the
alidade centrally on the board in a new position. Level again, if needed.
Proceed in this way till the table is as perfectly levelled as it can be.
After a little experience one may leave the board off while setting up
the tripod.
See that the spindle clamp and slow motion screw are working well,
that the levelling screws are all bearing somewhat firmer than for a
transit, and that the tripod heard (in some instruments) is screwed down
tight to the tripod, cap. Leave the spindle undamped.
The center of the sheet being known, stick up a common pin there.
Everything being found, or made, secure, and the board standing steady,
and level, is ready for work.
6. The line of sight is set upon a point very much as in the case of a
needle compass, or transit, with the difference that sometimes the alidade
is moved on the paper by the hands in order to do it. ami sometimes the
whole instrument is moved about its spindle axis and the line of sight set
by the spindle clamp and slow motion screw, while the alidade stands still
on the paper.
Points are located and line given by sighting with the telescope, the
same as with a transit, or with the compass sights, the same as with a
compass.
7. First work at first station of a survey. Set tfp the table at the sta-
tion. Choose a point on the paper to represent the station where the


91
table stands, so that the rest of the survey will come good on the paper.
Prick down the point and mark it for that station. Choose the direction
on the paper in which the first line of tlie survey is to lie, when platted.
Turn the board around so the assumed direction of the first line on the
paper is, by estimation, parallel to the line itself on the ground, and the
same end foremost. Clamp the spindle. Place the working edge of the
rule of the alidade to the pin at the center of the sheet. With the hands,
keep the rule to the pin, and bring the line of sight to look to another
station of the first line of suivey. By more delicate handling set the line
of sight upon the mark at the distant station. Place one side of a triangle
against the edge of the rule. Place the other triangle to the first, and
slide the first over the paper till the edge that was against the rule comes
to the mark on the paper for the first station. Draw a line through the
mark parallel to and in the direction of the line on the ground. Slide the
first triangle back to the rule and see if it still fits. If not, review'the
work, and correct the errors. Make the line drawn of the measured, or
estimated, length of the line itself, to the scale of the plat, and mark, at
its end, the second station of the survey.
8. General directions. Follow the edge of the rule, or triangle, care-
fully with the pencil held at the same inclination to the board for the
whole length of the line. Keep the pencil sharp. Draw no more of a line
than is needed. Avoid erasures, as much as possible. Be very particular
when prolonging a line on the paper. Keep the edges of the triangles
straight. Then they may be used to prolong a line by setting one of them
to the line and the other to it from the opposite side of the line, when
they may be slid past each other, alternately, in ttie direction the line is
to go to the place the prolongation is to reach. This operation may be
repeated and the position of the prolongation tested. If the edges of the
triangles are distrusted apply them to the-edge of the metal rule of the
alidade, and try to look through between the parts in contact against a
strong light. If the triangles are not true they may be worked down with
emory or sand paper, or a file, to fit the edge of the rule. They may also
be ground down on a grindstone.
9. Always place the alidade with the rule on the same hand of the
observer (either right or left, as is most convenient) on all lines of the
same survey, when looking along them in either direction. Do not change
hands with the rule when looking back over a line. Keep the ride in the
same hand and bring it to the other side of the line. A right handed per-
son will naturally take the alidade in the left hand and always bring the
ride to the left side of any lino. A left handed person would reverse this.
This would be the way to place the rule whether looking forward, or back-
ward, along a line. This means that a telescope on an alidade would not
be reversed on its axis but remain the same side up.


The Technic
10. The two edges of the rule should both be bevelled, be straight
and parallel, so that either can be used to work from.
11. When carrying the table about, see that the board is securely
fastened to the tripod head so it cannot fall off, and release the spindle
clamp. The plane table is a clumsy instrument to handle. It must be
carried with the more care and set down gently. Otherwise, the connec-
tions with the spindle or tripod head in many instruments can be easily
injured so as to make the table useless. The broad connections below the
board are much the best. Carry the alidade, and handle it, by a grasp
upon some part where a secure hold can be obtained, that will give good
control of it. Alidades are usually so heavy that they should be made
with a good hand hold. There are so many things to cany, some of
which are awkward to handle, that it is best to consider carefully, such
features.
'12. Preparations at a second station of a survey. These are to place the
board in position for making observations at a station by means of a line
platted on the paper which runs to that station. It is orienting the board
by means of a platted line.
Sot up the table at the station. Take out the pin at the center of the
sheet. Place the edge of a triangle to the platted line. Slide the triangle
by means of the other as if to draw a line at the center of the sheet,
nearly covering the center of the sheet. Hold the first triangle down
steady with the fingers near the edge on the center of the sheet. With
the other hand, bring the edge of the rule of the alidade up to the edge of
the triangle at the center of the sheet. With a sliding movement of the
alidade fit the edge of the rule to the triangle. Be careful not to shift the
triangle, as it is easily moved by the heavier alidade. After setting the
rule see if it stands parallel to the line it was set by.
If the spindle happens to be clamped, release it. Turn the board to
direct the line of sight to the distant station on the line used in placing
the alidade at the center of the sheet. Clamp the spindle. By the spin-
. die slow motion screw set the line of sight on the mark at the distant
station.
In placing the triangle to the line in the first place, and the alidade
at the center of the sheet, have regard to the relative position of things on
the table and on the ground, so that when the line of sight is finally set
on the mark at the distant station, the line joining the plats of the stations
on the board shall be parallel to the corresponding line on the ground and
lie the same end foremost.
The board, or table, now stands parallel to its former position. It is
oriented, and ready for work.
13. Measuring a vertical angle. Set up the table. Place the alidade
central on the table, with the edge of the rule at the center of the sheet


93
and the line of sight on a mark at the station on the line where the verti-
cal angle is tp be measured. Set the horizontal cross wire on the mark
that shows one side of the angle to be read, by means of the telescope axis
clamp and slow motion screw. Read the vertical circle. Record the
reading Release the telescope axis. By the means used before set the
horizontal cross wire on the mark on the other side of the angle. Read the
vertical circle. Record the reading. Release the telescope axis. By the
same means set the horizontal cross wire again upon the first mark. Read
the vertical circle. Record the reading. See if the first and last readings
agree sufficiently well. If not, review the work and correct the errors.
The difference of the readings will show the angle.
14. If the vertical angle is an angle of elevation or depression, set the
horizontal cross wire on the mark as first above directed. Read the ver-
tical circle. Record the reading. Release the telescope axis. By its
clamp and slow motion screw set the telescope so its level will read level.
Read the vertical circle. Record the reading. Reverse the alidade on
the board and bring it up to the line with the rule on the opposite side of
the center of the sheet. Set the telescope level to read level, if it needs
it, by means of its slow motion screw. Read the vertical circle. Record
the reading. Release the telescope axis. Set the horizontal cross wire
on the mark again by means of the clamp and slow motion screw to the
telescope axis. Read the vertical circle. Record the reading. See if
the two middle readings (taken when the telescope was level) agree well.
If they are very different, the board is not flat, or it is unsteady. It may
be set firmer, but if it is uneven, the angle value will be poor. Having
found the readings to be as good as practicable, find the angle by the first
pair of readings, and also by the second pair. Take the half sum of the
two values for the correct one.
15. To measure the angle of elevation or depression of a line, measure
the.height of the telescope axis from the ground and sight to a mark at
the same height from the „round at the other end of the line. If the line
is not on the ground measure the distance of the telescope axis from it in
a similar manner, and sight to a mark at a corresponding distance from
the line at another place on it. Measure the angle of elevation or depres-
sion of the line from the transit axis of the telescope to the corresponding
mark at the station by the method described.
16. Rem. The work that can be done with the plane table depends
directly upon the methods of ascertaining the position of a point with
respect to other known points. These methods come first.
The expression "set the alidade" upon a line or mark means that
the edge of the rule is to be placed at the center of the sheet and the line
of sight set upon tha ne, or mark.


The Technic.
Capital letters denote points on the ground, and the small letters the
plats of the same points on the sheet.
The work of the plane table can be done with a transit and drawing
board, by platting the work as it goes on.
17. Determining a point by direct measurement. Orient the table at a
known station. Set the alidade upon the line to the required point.
Plat a line from a plat of the instrument station, parallel to the edge of
the rule and running towards the required point. Measure the distance
from the instrument station to the required point, by chain, steel tapes,
or stadia. If the stadia is used the telescope axis should stand at the
center of the sheet. Lay off this distance, to the proper scale, from the
station on the plat along the line drawn. Prick down the point thus
reached, and mark it for the required point.
18. Determining a point by intersections. Fig. I. LI A and B be
determined and platted at a and 6. Set up the table at A and orient it
by a b. Set the alidade on a line to C. Draw from a, towards 0, a line
parallel to the edge of the rule, and continue it .
to the estimated position of c on the sheet. Set C
the alidade again upon A B. See if the edge of
the rule is parallel to a b. If not, review the
work and correct the errors. Take up the plane
table. Set it up at B. Orient it by 6 a. Set the
alidade on B C, a line to C. Draw from b, towards
C, a line parallel to the edge of the rule till it
intersects the line from a, parallel to A C. Set
the alidade again upon A B. See if the edge of
the rule is parallel to b a. If not, review the
work and correct the errors. Prick down the intersection of the two lines
drawn from a and b and mark this point c.
But a short piece of a c, or b c, or of both, may be needed, near c.
Any number of points may be determined from a base A B. a c and b c
should intersect as nearly as may be at right angles. If a c and 6 c inter-
sect at a small angle the result cannot be trusted. Other lines to c from
d, e, or /, other known points, will help to fix its position. A number of
lines to c will not all intersect at the same point on tiie paper. The proper
location of the point on paper is theoretically a question of mathematical
adjustment, but there are usually some circumstances connected with the
work which will enable the selection to be made properly.
19. Determining points by resection. This is in reality a method by
intersections. The difference between this and the last case is, that one
of the two lines necessary to determine the point is drawn on the paper
while the table is set up at the point whose position is sought. In the


95
previous case objects may be located, or determined, without going to
them. In the case of resection the table is set up at the station, or object,
whose position is sought. This is an advantage in carrying out work, as
the table may be advauced to a station before it is on the map, if there is
a line on the paper that runs to it from some known station that is in
sight from it. By referring to Fig. 1 the principle of this method may be
stated. Let A and B be known and platted, at a and b. Set up the table
at A and orient it by a h. Set the alidade on a line to C. Draw from a,
towards C, a line parallel to the edge of the rule, and continue it to where
c. is thought to be on the paper, or beyond. Set the alidade again upon
A B. See if the edge of the rule is parallel to a b. If not, review the
work, and correct the errors. Take up the plane table. Set it up at C.
Orient it by the indefinite line from a, towards c. Set the alidade on C B.
Draw from b, (towards C were the table at B) a line intersecting the
indefinite line from a, and parallel to the edge of the rule. Set the alidade
again upon C A. See if the edge of the rule is parallel to the indefinite
line from a towards c. If not, review the work, and correct the errors.
In a similar manner lines may be drawn on the map, or plat, from any
number of stations in sight from C, whose positions have been platted.
Several lines thus drawn, running to c will help fix its po ition with much
greater precision.
20. Rem. A single intersection is not sufficient to fix a station on the
plat. A direction line and a measured distance are not alone sufficient.
When a point is to be determined by intersection there should be a num-
ber of lines observed that run to it. When a point is to be determined by
measurements, there should be two or more. A combination of intersect-
ing lines and measurements may be used. The position of any station
on the plat should not be used to determine the position of any other
station, or object, unless its own position has been well checked. Every
available check upon the position of a station should be used. Neglect
no chance to tie up a station. A check which shows an error in the posi-
tion of the station tested, may really reveal an error in the position of the
station from which the test comes. A check works at both ends, and tests
the position of both stations concerned. What constitutes a good deter-
mination of a point? This can be ascertained only by experience upon
any particular work, and with the instruments in use. The stadia may
be used with the bi st plane tables to get distances and heights on much
work. For general topographical surveys the stadia will propably give
good results. When filling in final details to a large scale it may be found
unsuitable especially as to elevations. Any general statement relating to
such matters must be materially modified by the person doing the work
and the circumstances of the case. These facts render such statements
of little value. .


The Technic.
21. In orienting the table use more than a single, line, wliere practi-
cable, no matter how well that line may have been determined. That is,
orient by a line, and test the orientation by sights to other stations, if
possible. This serves to further check the plat.
22. The advantage of resection is, that after one or more lines to the
new station have been platted, it is possible to set up the table at that
station and by observing to other stations get a number of lines running
to the new station with a single setting of the table, when by intersec-
tions, each of the stations observed would have to be occupied. This is
often a very great advantage. With some patience, it is conceivable that
the table might be oriented at a new station by persistent trial in taking
'pointings on other stations, at the same time the new station was deter-
mined. There are better ways of doing this, given below.
23. Determining a point by the "Three Point Problem " and orienting the
table. Fig. 2. Let the three points A, B, and 0, be well determined upon
the plat. Let the position of D, from which A, B, and C, can be seen, be
required, without going to them.
Fasten an extra piece of paper over
the middle of the board. Find the cen-
ter of the sheet on this paper. Call the
center of the sheet on this paper to. Set
up the table at D. Clamp the table so
the extra piece of paper will receive the
lines DA, DB, and DC, when platted
from the center of the sheet. Set the
alidade on D A and draw a line, by the
edge of the rule, from m towards A. ~" £ I
Set the alidade on D B and D C, in suc-
cession, and draw lines from m towards B and C, respectively. Notice
the position of D with respect to A B C, that is, see if D lies on the convex
or concave side of the broken line ABC. Fit the three legged dividers to
the platted positions, on the plane table sheet, of the points A, B, and C.
Make the fit carefully. Apply the points of the dividers to the lines from
m towards A, B, and C, each point of the dividers upon the line running
towards the point it was fitted to the plat of. By careful adjustment,
make the points of the dividers fit the three lines. Prick down the points
on the lines where the dividers fit. The center of the sheet, to, on the
extra piece of paper, is in the same relative position with respect to the
three points, on the three lines, that were pricked down with the points
of the three legged dividers, that D is with respect to A, B, and C, on the
ground, and may be transferred to the plane table sheet with the three
legged dividers, thus obtaining the correct plat of all four points.


Orient the table by means of a line from the plat of D, on the plane
table sheet, to the plat of either A, B, or O, and test its position by lines
to the other points. Use the longest line to orient by.
When the plats of A, B, and 0, cannot be embraced by the three
legged dividers, use the same equal parts of the lines from the plat of B
to the plats of A and C, and take up the plat of B, and the two auxiliary
points with the dividers. Fit the dividers to the three lines from m as
before. The point to will form the fourth angle of a quadrilateral whose
sides bear the same ratio to the sides of the one required on the plat, that
the parts first used do to the whole lines used on the plat. Fix a third
auxiliary point on the plat with respect to the plat of B and the two first
auxiliary points with the dividers. Draw auxiliary lines from this third
auxiliary point to the others and to the plat of B. Extend the line to the
plat of B beyond the third auxiliary point. Draw lines from the plats of
A and C, respectively parallel to the near sides of the quadrilateral of
auxiliary lines and produce them to intersect. They should intersect on
the line from the plat of B. If they do not, review the work, and correct
the errors. This intersection is the plat of D.
24. Determining a point by the "Two Point Problem," and orienting the
table. Fig. 3. Let two points, A and B, be well determined on the plat.
Let the position of C, from which A and B can be seen, be required,

sent the length of D C, and prick down, on the extra paper, a temporary
plat of C. Set the alidade-on C A and C B, in succession, and complete,
upon the assumed length for D C, a temporary plat of A B C D. By this
means obtain a temporary plat of A B upon the extra piece of paper. The
angle between the plat of A B on the plane table sheet and the temporary


The Technic.
plat of A B on the extra sheet is the amount the board is to be turned to
correctly orient it with respect to A B on the ground and the plat of A B
on the plane table sheet. Set the alidade at m parallel to the temporary
plat of A B upon the extra sheet. Find or fix a mark in range of the line
of sight. Set the alidade at m parallel to the correct plat of A B on the
plane table sheet. Release the spindle clamp. Set the line of sight on
the mark by means of the spindle clamp and slow motion screw. The
table is oriented correctly with respect to A B. Resect upon A and B to
determine C.
After orienting the table its position may be tested. Set the alidade
on m and parallel to the temporary plat of either C D or C B on the extra
sheet. Release the spindle clamp. Set the line of sight on D, or B. by
means of the spindle clamp and slow motion screw. Set the alidade on m
and parallel to the temporary plat of A B on the extra sheet. The line of
sight should strike the mark formerly used.
Particular notice must be taken to observe which side of A B, the
station C is on the ground and to conform the temporary plat to the posi-
tion of the stations on the ground so as to prevent reversing the table
when finally orienting it, or of using the supplement of the proper angle
when making that.orientation.
If D is to be used in continuing the survey; after resecting upon A
and B to get C, set the alidade on C D and draw a line from the plat of C
to get the plat of D. Move the table. Set it up at D. Orient it by the
line from the plat of C towards D. Resect on
A and B to get D. It should fall on the line
from the plat of C.
The quadrilateral on the plane table sheet,
or the triangle A B C, in case D is not platted on
the plane table sheet, may be compared with the
temporary plat upon the extra sheet. The angles
should be equal, and the sides proportional.
C D may lie in any relation to A B—cross it
if necessary.
25. When it is possible to set the table in line
with A B, by trial, as at D, Fig. 4, orient it by a h
_T, *s i at once. Set the alidade on D C and diaw a line

A» table to C. Set it up. Orient it by the last
named line. Resect on A and B to get C. Set the alidade on C D. Draw
a line from c parallel to C D to intersect a b produced for d.
26. Elevations. Differences in elevation as obtained with the plane
table may be good enough for some topographical surveys. They may be


99
obtained in several ways. Except those of the rudest character, they
require a telescope on the alidade, a vertical circle or arc, a level on the
telescope, or both. The telescope level should be a striding leuel, of the
Buff and Berger pattern, standing on collars turned on the body tube of
the telescope. These levels are readily attached and detached, and can-
not drop off. The telescope may be furnished with stadia wires and the
stadia used to get heights and distances both. The distances may be
used to check those obtained by platting on the sheet.
27. If a telescope is used the height of the transit axis from the under
side of the rule should be measured and kept in mind in taking heights.
This distance abded to the height of the table above the ground, at any
station will give the height of the line of sight of the telescope above the
ground when horizontal, or the height of the transit axis from the ground.
28. If compass sights are used and rough levels are wanted let a line
be drawn parallel to the under side of the rule near the top of the sights
on one side for depressions, and near the botton of the sights on the other
side, for elevations. On the rear sight place a peep sight on each of these
lines. On the front sight mark graduations or a scale of feet per hundred,
like the tangent scales on compass sights, for elevations on one side and
depressions on the other. Find the height of each level line from the
under side of the rule to be added to the height of the table frorr the
ground to get the height of the level line of sight from the ground.
29. Taking differences of elevation. With the plane table set up at a
station, to get the difference in elevation from the ground under it to the
ground at some other station, or place. Place the alidade central on the
table. Release the spindle clamp. Level the table carefully.
If the difference is small, it may be taken as levels are taken, for
short distances.
Measure the height of the table from the ground and add this to the
height of the level line of sight from the under side of the rule to get the
height of the line of sight from the ground. Call this H. I. It is plus.
Have a rod held at the place where the difference in elevation is to
be taken. Sight by the level line of sight to the rod, and take a rod read-
ing. Call this—S. It is minus. If compass sights are used hold a pencil
point at the forward mark, and be sure the table is well levelled. Sub-
tract the rod reading from H I (the height of the instrument) to -get the
difference in elevation. If the result is plus the place where the rod was
held is the higher, if minus it is lower. If a telescope is used it is set
level by its striding level and the rod reading taken even if the table does
not stand quite level. If better results are sought have the table well
levelled. If much nicety is required lift the telescope from its transit axis
bearings, turn it over, replace it with the transit axis reversed and the


The Technic.
telescope the other side up, level it again, and take a second rod reading.
Take the half sum of the two rod readings for the correct one. It will be
easier to keep the telescope, its line of sight, and its striding level, in good
adjustment where much of this is to be done, than it will to take double
rod readings.
30. If the differences in elevation are too large to be reached in the
way described, proceed as follows.
Get H. I. as before. Sight to a mark on the rod held up at the place,
the same distance from the grcund the line of sight is. With compass
sights, hold a pencil point to the forward sight so it is in range from the
peep sight to the mark on the rod. Take the reading of the scale on the
forward compass sight at the pencil point. Multiply this by the distance
in hundreds of feet to the rod for the difference in elevation. Record the
scale reading ± with a note of the place where the rod was held and do
the multiplying at a convenient time. With a telescope, set the line of
sight on a mark on the rod held at the place at the same height from the
ground, the line of sight is. Read the verticle circle. Record the read-
ing ± with a. note of the place the rod is held at. Set the telescope level,
by means of its level. Read the verticle cercle. Record the reading ±
with the former reading. The difference between these two readings will
be the angle of elevation, +, or depression, —, of a line joining the sur-
face of the ground at the station where the table stands with the surface
of the ground at the place where the rod is held. The distance between
the two places may be taken from the plane table sheet, or measured.
The difference in elevation equals this distance multiplied by the tangent
of the angle. For greater refinements, the telescope may be turned over,
and the observations repeated, taking the half sum of the two reaulting
angles for use. if the angle of eleyation is not over 5° or 300', the differ-
ence in elevation may be computed by the following equation.
Diff. in El. = d jS A ~ 1/10 A1+^ A ~ 1/8000 A + .0000000 2 d j
d = distunce in feet. A = the angle in minutes. If A is an angle of
elevation the result will be plus, if an angle of depression, the result will
be minus. The last term covers the correction for curvature and refrac-
tion and is always plus, as shown. The terms in the numerator give the
tan. A at 5°, correct to 6 places. For A &lt; 5° tan. A will be somewhat
large, but only .00000043 for A = 0° 01'. This equation can be used with-
in the limits named, in place of tables.
31. When a stadia is used the telescope must have cross wires in it to
give stadia readings, and a stadia made to fit the cross wires and telescope.
With this outfit, take and record the height of the transit axis of the tele-


101
scope from the ground at the instrument station. Hold up the stadia at
the place whose distance and elevation is sought. Set the middle hori- i
zontal cross wire on a reading of the stadia, equal to the height of the
transit axis from the ground. Bead the vertical circle. Record the read-
ing, ±. Read the stadia at both the other horizontal cross wires. Record
these readings. Set the telescope level, by means of its level. Read the
vertical circle. Record this reading, ±, with the former reading. For
greater refinements, the telescope may be turned over, and the observa-
tions duplicated, taking the half sum of all readings for their final values,
for use, with a note of the place the stadia was held at. The stadia notes
may be reduced by any suitable method amongst those in use. For the
determination of the constants relating to the particular telescope in use
the methods given in Searle's Field Engineering 223d section, are good.
The stadia may be used to determine contours, also, by the methods
designated in such books as Johnson's Surveying, for such work.
TRANSMISSION OF POWER BY COMPRESSED AIR.
BY JOHN R. ALLEN, '92.
A recent article by the late Mr. Pope in the Engineering Magazine, in
which he criticizes the electrical transmission at Niagara Falls, has caused
a great deal of comment among the engineering profession. Mr. Pope
makes the statement and gives general figures to substantiate it, that a
compressed air transmission at Niagara Falls would have been more
economical than electricity. As we all know, the loss in transmission by
compressed air is extremely small, not over 5 per cent.; but on the other
hand, the losses in the motor and compressor, are relatively large. Owing
to Mr. Pope's death before having completed the article, he has not given
us any detailed account of the manner in which he proposed to overcome
these difficulties.
With the simple transmission, without reheating the air before enter-
ing the motor cylinder, the efficiency of the motor and compressor
decreases as the pressure at the compressor increases. Yet, Mr. Pope
proposes to use three thousand pounds pressure per square inch, and
possibly higher. According to present data on the subject as given in
trade catalogues, the resulting efficiency would not be over twenty-five
per cent. But let us consider from a theoretical standpoint what efficiency
may be obtained if the air be reheated before entering the motor cylinder.
The cut accompanying this article represents the theoretical action of the
air in the compressor, and motor. The initial volume of air in the com-




pressor, as shown in the figure is twenty-eight cubic feet, which at atmos-
pheric pressure weighs two and twelve-hundredths pounds. Let this air
be compressed adiabaticaliy from atmospheric pressure to sixty pounds
per square inch. The compression is represented by the line AB, at the
point B after compression it has attained a temperature of 375°. At a
constant pressure of sixty pounds per square inch, the air is cooled in
transmission until it has returned to sixty degrees temperature which is
represented by the point E, on the line AL which is the isothermal for
60°; at E the air enters the motor cylinder, and expands adiabaticaliy to
the point M, on the atmospheric line, where the temperature owing to
the expansion has been reduced to -137° F. The work done upon the air
during compression will be represented by the area ABCD, and the useful
work obtained from the expansion by the area EMCD. The combined
efficiency of the compressor and motor will be the area EMCD divided by
ABCD, which in this case is 63.7 per cent. If, instead of allowing the air
at the point E to enter the motor at a temperature of 60°, we heat it to
375°, thereby increasing its volume to the point B, the work done upon
the gas will be the area ABCD plus the heat units required to heat the
gas (45.82 B.I.IT.) and the useful work the area ABCD. Under these
conditions the efficiency will be 75.9 per cent., allowing the reheating
furnace an efficiency of 80 per cent.
Suppose, now, instead of compressing to sixty pounds per square
inch, we wish to compress to two hundred pounds per square inch.
Theoretically, if the air could be compressed and expanded along the
isothermal the efficiency would be perfect and the nearer we approximate
the isothermal curve, the better efficiency will be obtained, this may be
accomplished by a series of compressions. Let the air be compressed
and cooled to the point E as in the first case. At the point E, pass the
air into a second compressor and compress it to one hundred and twenty
pounds pressure. The resulting temperature being 156°. The air has now
been brought to the point F. At F allow the air to cool until the volume
has reached the point H on the isothermal. Under the conditions at H
let the air pass into a third compressor, and compress it to the point I,
where a pressure of two hundred pounds per square inch and a tempera-
ture of 135° has been attained. At this point let it again be cooled by
transmission to the motor to the point L. At L it enters the motor cylin-
der and is expanded to N on the atmospheric line, the temperature being
reduced to -219°. The work done on the gas will be represented by the
area ABEFHILKD, and the work done by the gas equals the areaNLKD.
The efficiency in this case would be fifty-four and a half per cent. If a
single compression instead of a triple compression had been used the
efficiency would have been forty-six per cent. Suppose, now, the air at


L be heated so that on expanding its temperature will be 60° when it has
reached the atmospheric line. The work done on the gas will be the same
as in the preceding case, plus the heat expanded for reheating, and the
useful work done by the gas will now be the area AYKD. Under these
conditious we get an efficiency (with a furnace efficiency of 80 per cent.)
of 86.4 per cent, as compared with 54 per cent, without reheating and of
40 per cent, with single compression or a net saving over single compres-
sion of 87.9 per cent. In order to obtain an efficiency of 86.4 per cent., it
is necessary to reheat the air to 670°. The necessity of reheating to such
a high temperature may be overcome by working the air in a triple
expansion motor with reheaters before the first and between the cylinders.
The expansion line would be 1HFEBA, and under these conditions the
resulting efficiency 81.7 per cent.
The figure shows that with multiple compression the adiabatic and
isothermal curves approach each other as the pressure increases and
consequently we are working the air more efficiently.
Consider, now, the efficiency of operation if the pressure in the com-
pressor be raised to 1000 pounds per square inch. To do this take the air
at the point L and pass it into a fourth compressor. Compress it to 1000
pounds per square inch where it attains a temperature of 366°, the volume
being reduced to .63 of a cubic foot. Let the air before entering the engine
be raised to such a temperature that it will exhaust at 60°. In order to
do this it must be reheated to a temperature of 1752°. The efficiency
under these conditions will be 92.5 per cent. But in order to obtain this
result it has been necessary to reheat the air to almost the temperature at
which cast iron melts which would be practically impossible. We limy
overcome this difficulty by working the air in a triple expansion motor
with three reheaters. These reheaters may use as the reheating medium
steam at seventy pounds pressure. Its action in the motor would he as
follows: The air before entering the motor will be reheated from 60" to
366°. It is then expanded in the first cylinder to 200 pounds pressure and
60° temperature. Before entering the second cylinder, it is again reheated
by steam at seventy pounds pressure to a temperature of 300°. In the
second cylinder it is allowed to expand to 60 pounds pressure and 60'
temperature. After a third reheating to a temperature of 360° it is allowed
to expand in the final cylinder to atmospheric pressure at a temperature
of 60°. The efficiency of compressor and motor would be 81.0 per cent.,
which is almost the same as that obtained when working the air in a
triple expansion motor using 200 pounds pressure. By the operation of
the air as just described, we are able to use 1000 pounds pressure with as
good an efficiency or better than with the use of 200 pounds pressure. It
would seem reasonable that with sufficient number of expansions and


compressions, we might use air at 3000 pounds pressure as economically
as if at 200 pounds pressure. If we can in practice approximate the
efficiencies of motor and compressor which are obtained from theory, and
knowing that the line loss in compressed air is almost negligable, may it
not be possible that compressed air will soon be a formidable rival of
electricity in the transmission of power?
A NOVEL ENGINEERING SCHEME.
ELEZAB DARROW, '92.
In these days, when central stations of our large cities are pressed
for room, in which to make extensions or additions to their plants, numer-
ous expedients have been resorted to. Property which is near the center
of distribution and suitable for central station purposes, is at once both
difficult to find and usually obtained only at a very considerable cost.
Then again when a new station is contemplated, it is often a desired
end that the new plant be large enough in capacity to do away with
operation at the old quarters.
Here a further difficulty arises, from the fact that all trunk lines of
wires branch out from the old plant, and if an underground system is in
operation, the difficulty is further enhanced, and the expense and cost of
a change increased.
It is this last case that recently caused a novel project to be considered
in one of our large western cities. The business of the company referred
to had entirely outgrown the old quarters, and the adjoining property was
held at such a value, that buying was out of the question. Furthermore
a system of underground conduits, covering the business portion of the
city, centered in this old station, and any change in this could only be
made at a very great expense.
Yet the nearest available site for a new plant was a mile further
removed from the heart of the city and the subway district. The distri-
bution of current on this underground system, for light and power pur-
poses, was made at pressures of 120 volts and 240 volts. The generators x
furnishing this current were direct connected multipolars of 100 K.W. and
200 K. W. capacity. The general situation, stated above, being under-
stood, the following scheme was offered as a solution to this problem,
which I believe is quite original in its method of application.
It was proposed that the 100 K. W. and 200 K. W. dynamos be
removed from their engines and fitted with shafts, bearings and collector
rings, so that they could be operated as rotary converters, at a frequency
of 14 cycles.


The Technic.
These rotary converters were to be erected in the basement of the
present plant and used to feed the underground system. The balance of
the plant was to be removed. The building thus vacated, being a sub-
stantial one and centrally located, was to be fitted for offices or apartments.
Transformers were to be erected, in the basement of the present
plant, and also in the new station, cables being laid in ducts to connect
the two-phase alternators of the new plant with the rotary converters at
the old place. On this line a potential of 2000 volts would be used.
The alternating generators at the new plant were to be constructed
for the quarter phase system, they having twenty poles and at 14 cycles
a capacity of 300 K. W. These generators were to be direct connected to
Corliss engines giving the desired frequency at a speed of 85 revolutions
per minute.
The advantages of the proposed plan are many. The multipolar
generators when used as rotary converters at so low a frequency should
be absolutely noiseless, which is very essential should the building be
used for other purposes, and they should carry a very considerably larger
load than they are capable of handling as direct current dynamos.
The transformers would also be entirely noiseless, the frequency
being lower than that of the lowest audible note.
The excess of generator capacity at the new plant would be available
for high tension lighting and power distribution. Since it would be
desirable at times to change the pressure on the machines, permanent
reactances were to be placed in the alternating leads to the rotary con-
verters. These reactances would make possible a variation in the pres-
sure on the direct current side, by the same variation in field strength.
The adjustments should be small, provided a constant pressure be main-
tained at the generators.
It would no doubt be possible to start the rotary converter station and
let it run for hours, without attention to pressures, and we thus see that
the cost of attendance in this plant would be a small item.

These dimensions are over the rubber but do not include the thick-
ness of the braid.
In making these tests an effort was made to have all conditions as
nearly as possible such as are experienced in actual practice, keeping on
the conservative side wherever there was any option. The tests were
made in a dark room, with doors and windows closed to prevent a circu-
lation of air. The wires on insulators were placed on standard porcelain
insulators on the side walls, and temperature readings were taken from
the outside surface of the insulation near the middle of a forty-foot length.
The wires in moulding were looped into fourteen-foot lengths of three
wire popular moulding, of proportions prescribed by the Chicago Board of
Fire Underwriters, which in turn was securely fastened to the ceiling. By
looping one continuous wire through the three grooves of the moulding a
condition of load was obtained fully equal to the maximum experienced
on any three wire or three wire convertible system of wiring. The tem-
perature was taken at the outside surface of the insulation of the wire in
each groove. The average of the temperatures thus obtained was used in
the above table.
Actual tests, determining the rise in temperature in degrees Fahren-
heit above the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere for different
current densities, were made on wires of the following sizes:
Numbers 14, 10, 6, 3, and 0, B. &amp; 8. gauge.


The Technic.
The results thus obtained were then plotted, using the circular milage
as ordinates the current in amperes as abscissas in this manner a tempera-
ture curve was obtained from which the curves for the immediate sizes
were deduced by .plotting as ordinotes the temperature rise and as
abscissas the current in amperes for any required circular milage.
Separate temperature curves were made for the solid wires and the
standard cables as the proportion of the radiating surface to the circular
milage of copper in each is different.
For general wiring purposes the amperage causing a rise in tempera-
ture of twenty degrees Fahrenheit will constitute a safe carrying capacity.
PIPE COVERING TESTS.
BY B. L. FOSTER, '96, AND C. S. MASON, '96.
The tests referred to in this article were for the purpose primarily of
determining the relative protection afforded by coverings of different
thicknesses. The Chicago Fire Proof Covering Co. very kindly interested
themselves in these experiments and sent on to the University, coverings
of different sizes so that by combining them thicknesses of %, %, 1, \%,
1% and 2 inches were obtained; the material was wool felt.
The tests were made, under the supervision of Prof. M. E. Cooley, in
the Pattern Loft of the Engineering Laboratory. This room is 77 ft. long,
38 ft. wide and has brick side walls 3 ft. 6 ins. high surmounted by a half-
pitch roof hipped at the ends. The north end contains a large gable
window extending to the floor; the south contains one and each side
three dormer windows placed about half way up the slope of the roof.
The roof is built in the usual manner of 2 x 4 rafters covered with i inch
matched boarding, felt and slate. Cross timbers extend across the roof
9 ft. from the floor from which the pipe lines are hung. On top of these
cross timbers boards were so disposed as to cut off direct exposure to the
windows in the roof and to make the exposure of the two pipe lines alike.
The pipe lines are arranged as follows: The steam supply rises
through the floor near the south end, and enters a Hine Eliminator
through a Curtis pressure regulating valve; from the top of this separator
two branches extend 15 inches in opposite directions and connect to
vertical risers which at the top connect with the steam end of each pipe
line. The bottom of these risers are dripped back to the separator and
the separator itself is dripped to the sewer. Each pipe line extends to
near the north end of the room, then returns parallel with itself to near
the point of starting where it discharges into a receiver fitted with a water


Ill
glass and air cocks. The lines are of 1)4 inch pipe each 89 ft. 6 ins. long;
they start 8 ft. 4 ins. from the floor and pitch 1 in. in 10 ft. The steam
ends are near the middle of the room and the return ends midway
between the middle and outside and about 6 ft. from the steam ends.
The two lines are exactly alike in dimensions and exposure except that
one has an east and the other a west exposure. The water of condensa-
tion passes from the receivers to coils placed in a barrel through which
cooling water flows, and is discharged into vessels and weighed on a
Buffalo scale weighing to hundredths of a pound.
Thermometers in the steam pipe leaving the separator where it
branches to each pipe line, and in the discharge end of each line just
above the receivers, give the temperature of the steam entering and
leaving the apparatus. A steam gauge connected to the separator gives
the pressure. Eight thermometers placed at the sides and in the middle
of the room give the temperature of the surrounding air and approxi-
mately of interior objects; the temperature of the roof was not observed.
Thermometers were inserted just under the outside muslin and the tem-
peratures were recorded as the temperature of the outside of the covering;
the temperature of the inside of covering has been assumed equal to the
temperature of the steam.
All thermometers, the steam gauge and the weighing scale were
carefully standardized for the work. All parts of the apparatus exposed
to radiation which would affect the results were carefully covered with
2 ins. of hair felt. No correction has been applied for losses taking place
through this hair felt; these must have been very small. In making the
tests the west pipe line was always bare, the east being inclosed by the
covering under test. The results obtained have all been referred to the
bare pipe as unity. The steam thermometers and gauges were read every
fifteen minutes and the room thermometers every half hour. The water
of condensation was weighed at the end of each hour, and the tests were
continued until the hourly results agreed within 1 per cent.
Each thickness of covering was tested under two pressures nominally,
5 lbs. and 10 lbs. per square inch. Preliminary tests with both pipe lines
bare were made under different pressures to establish a ratio for the two
sides. This ratio was for 5 lb. pressure 0.961 and for 10 lbs. 0.984. Since
the two pipe lines are alike and similarly exposed the ratio of the steam
condensed in each will be a measure of the insulating value of the cover-
ing, the bare pipe being taken as a unity.
In working out the results the methods of Thomas Box given in his
Practical Treatise on Heat have been followed. Let

The data taken during the tests and the calculated results appear in
the table. Many of the columns explain themselves.
Column 6 contains the temperatures of steam corresponding to the
absolute pressure; these should agree with the temperatures at leaving
in column 6.
Column 8 contains the number of degrees of superheat in the entering
steam produced by reduction of pressure.
Column 9 contains the observed temperatures of outside of coverings,
thermometer bulb inserted just under the muslin or duck.
Column 16 contains the ratio of the steam condensed in the covered
(east) pipe divided by that condensed in the bare (west) pipe; this ratio
is a measure of the effectiveness of the coverings.
Column 17 contains similar ratios found by dividing the quantities in
column 16 by the differences of temperature in column 12 and multiply-
ing by the difference between the temperature of steam in column 6 and
a constant room temperature of 70° F.
Column 18 contains the number of British thermal units per linear
foot from the steam condensed and the superheat.
Column 19 contains the results found by dividing the quantities in
column 18 by the ratio of condensations for bare pipes, 0.981 for 5 lbs.
pressure and 0.984 for 10 lbs. pressure.
Column 20 contains the results found by reducing the quantities in
in column 19 to the square foot.
Column 21 contains the results found by dividing the quantities in
column 20 by those in column 12.
Columns 23 and 24 contain the conductivities, one found by using the
nominal, the other by using the actual thickness of covering in the form-
ula quoted.
The average conductivity using the nominal thickness is 0.328; the
minimum value differs from this by 11% and the maximum by 6.09%.
The average conductivity using the actual thickness is 0.377; the mini-

mum and maximum values differ from this by the same amount, 4.2%.
The variations are doubtless in part due to the imperfect fit of some of
the coverings when placed over the others.

thickness of covering as abscissae and the quantities in the columns as

The experiments revealed the necessity of conducting such tests under
conditions that can be maintained practically constant. The effect of the
sun on the roof, especially in the winter time, could be readily seen. The
results varied uniformly during the forenoon, became constant at midday
and varied again during the afternoon. The results obtained when the

RELATIVE VALUE OF PIPE COVERINGS.*
M. E. COOLEY.
The Michigan Asylum at Kalamazoo had occasion in 1894 to cover
about 25,000 square feet of steam pipe surfaces. An effort was made
several months before issuing specifications to obtain data which would
serve to establish the actual value of the different coverings on the market.
The manufactures were invited to send samples of the coverings on which
they proposed to submit bids together with the results of any tests that
might have been made by disinterested experts showing the actual value
of their coverings.
The data thus obtained was not only meagre but quite unsatisfactory
in character. The Board of Control of the asylum therefore authorized a
series of tests to be made the results of which are presented in this article.
The coverings were purchased in the open markets by agents selected
by the asylum without knowledge of the use to which the coverings were
to be put and the different lots were shipped by these agents directly to
the Engineering Laboratory of the University of Michigan. Three cover-
ings, Nos. 23, 28 and 29, Table IV, were purchased directly from the
manufacturers after the other tests had been completed.
The tests were made under the direction of the writer and his assist-
ants, Messrs. T. H. Hinchman, Jr. and W. H. Dorrance, Jr., by Messrs.
A. L. Becker and J. C. Bird, Benior mechanical engineering students, and
embraced by them in a thesis for graduation in June, 1894.
The apparatus with which the tests were made was the same as that
described by Messrs. Foster and Mason in the preceding article entitled
Pipe Covering Tests, the only difference being that in the earlier tests the
\y2 inch pipe lines were exactly 90 feet long instead of 89 ft. 6 ins.
After the pipe lines had been erected and tested for tightness a series
of preliminary tests were made for the purpose of establishing the accuracy
of the method adopted, viz., of comparing the condensations in two similar
lines of pipes, one of which was bare, the other protected by the different
kinds of covering.

Both pipe lines were first tested bare under pressures varying from
5 lbs. to 35 lbs. per sq. inch and with varying room temperatures; the
ratio of condensations for the two sides was found to be practically con-
stant and approximately unity. Similar tests were made with one side
covered. The results appear in Tables I, II and III.

Table I embraces the results obtained with 1-inch wool felt covering,
the steam pressure varying from 20.05 lbs. to 51.47 lbs. per sq. inch abso-
lute, the room temperature being approximately constant at 60° Fall.
The first column shows the pressures, the second the number of pounds
of steam condensed per hour in the bare pipe line, the third the number
of pounds condensed in the covered pipe line and the fourth the ratio of
these two condensations. The average of these ratios is 0.2316; one, the
fourth, differs from the average by 3.5%. Omitting this ratio the average
is 0.2332 and the maximum variation is then only 1.8%.
The seventh and eighth columns show the number of British thermal
units transmitted per linear foot per hour from the two pipe lines and the
ninth or last column the number of B. T. U. per square foot per hour from

the bare l)^-inch pipe. If the results shown in this table be plotted using
the pressures as abscissae the curves will be found to approach straight
lines very nearly.

Table II embraces the results obtained with 1-inch wool felt covering,
the room temperature varying from 54°.47 to 75°.08 Fah., the steam pressure
being constant at 24.4 lbs. per sq. inch absolute. The first column shows
the room temperature, the other columns being the same as in Table I.
The average of the ratios of condensation in the fourth column is 0.234S,
the maximum variation being only 1.7%. The average ratios of condensa-
tion in the two tables differ by less than 0.7%, omitting the fourth line
in Table I.
Table III embraces the results obtained with 1-inch air space cover-
ing, the room temperature varying from 71°.01 to 88°.88 Fah., the steam
pressure being constant at 24.2 lbs. per sq. inch absolute. The results are
arranged the same as in Table II. The average of the ratios of condensa-
tion in the fourth column is 0.3023, the maximum variation being 1.8%.
The results of these special tests indicate that for practical purposes
we may assume the ratio of the condensations between a bare and a
covered pipe under Hie same conditions of exposure to represent fairly the
value of a covering as a non-conductor of heat, this ratio being unaffected
by differences of steam pressure or differences of room temperature.


117
This does not appear to be equally true, however, when the expos-
ures differ materially during the tests as is pointed out by Messrs. Foster
and Mason in their paper on Pipe Covering Tests. The apparatus made
use of was in the attic of the Engineering Laboratory and the roof formed
a part of the exposure; this varied in temperature being dependent on
the weather. From the log of Messrs. Becker and Bird it appears that
they were careful to select from a number of tests only those in which the
outside temperatures, weather conditions and exposures were approxi-
mately the same; unfortunately their log in these special tests is not
complete as to weather conditions and the exact effect of the same cannot
be told with certainty from these tests alone.
It remains also for future tests to demonstrate whether these ratios
will continue constant under high pressures and under temperatures
differing widely from those recorded in the tables.

Table IV embraces the results obtained with twenty-nine different
coverings. The names of the manufacturers are omitted for obvious
reasons, and the coverings are grouped under five heads: Numbers 1 to 9
inclusive are moulded coverings, number 8 having a moulded core with a
wool felt jacket. Numbers 10 to 16 are wool felt coverings under various
forms and names, some of them being made up with one or more sheets
of asbestos paper. Numbers 17 to 19 are air-space coverings, the airspace
being formed of sheet iron covered with one-half inch of wool felt with


The Technic.
one or more sheets of asbestos paper. Numbers 20 to 23 are miscellaneous
sectional coverings, there being but little difference between numbers 21
and 22. Number 20 was an inferior grade of mineral wool. Numbers 24
to 29 are miscellaneous non-sectional coverings. Number 26 has been
regarded as a standard form of hair felt covering and its results are taken
as unity in the comparisons of relative insulating values shown in column
18 of the table. Numbers 28 and 29 are supposed to be of the same thick-
ness, one-eighth inch, the object being to show the relative merits of one
wrap of asbestos paper and of several wraps equal in thickness to the one
wrap. Number 24 should be studied in connections with numbers 28
and 29.
Most of the columns are self-explanatory. Column 6 shows the
temperature of the entering steam and column 6 the temperature of the
steam in the pipe which is the same as that of the water of condensation
leaving; the difference between these tempeiatures is the number of
degrees of superheat in the entering steam which is shown in column 7.
Columns 8 and 9 show the weights of steam condensed in the bare and
covered pipe lines respectively, and column 10 the ratio of these condens-
ations. The results in column 10 are directly comparable. Columns 11
and 12 show the heat units liberated per linear foot per hour from the
covered pipe by condensation and reduction of superheat respectively and
column 13 the total heat liberated per linear foot per hour. Column 18
shows the relative insulating values of the different coverings based on
hair felt, number 26, as unity. The numbers in this column are found as
follows: The quantities in column 10 which express the fraction of heat
lost by the covered pipe in terms of the bare pipe are subtracted from
unity, the differences representing the saving of heat by the coverings;
the ratio of these savings to that for hair felt, number 26, gives the quan-
tities in column 18: e. g., number 26 shows a loss of 0.152 of that of a bare
pipe, or a saving of 1 — 0.152 — 0.848; number 20 shows a loss of 0.193 or
a saving of 1 — 0.193 = 0.807; the ratio of 0.807 to 0.846 is 0.952 which
represents the insulating value of mineral wool in comparison with hair
felt. In the same way number 4 shows a loss of 0.224 or a saving of
1 — 0.224 = 0.776 and the ratio of 0.776 to 0.848 is 0.915.
Column 21 shows the time required to apply 90 feet of each covering;
these quantities will of course vary with the skill of the workmen.
Columns 22 and 23 show the appearance, fit and general characteristics
of each covering as observed by the gentlemen conducting the tests;
obviously these data would also depend more or less upon the skill of
those applying the coverings.
While hair felt applied in the old fashioned way shows the highest
saving it must not be forgotten that it is unsuited for high pressures, the

same being true in general for the wool felts. Hair felt for low pressures
and temperatures such as are used in heating will be found durable and
very satisfactory; an examination after thirteen years' service under a
pressure of 5 lbs. per sq. inch showed it to be only very slightly charred
and apparently good for another thirteen years. Hair felt is more expen-
sive, however, than some of the other forms of coverings and it may be
found that the difference in cost will moie than offset the difference in
saving.
It is only within a few years that the practical saving due to.covering
pipes has come to be appreciated. As illustrative of this saving the
results of computations in connection with the work at the Michigan
Asylum by Messrs. Becker and Bird may be cited: The steam pipes are
carried in underground conduits. The temperature of the conduits was
assumed at 90° Fah., the temperature of the steam in the pipes, 216° and
the temperature of the return water (gravity circulation) at 190°. Thirteen
sizes of pipe were used ranging from 16 to %-inch. By formulae in Box's
Practical Treatise on Heat, the total loss of heat per hour with bare pipes
was found to be 3,355,224 B. T. U. The number of heat units required to
convert 1 lb. of water from 190° into steam at 216° is 989.8; therefore the
loss with bare pipes would be equivalent to the condensation of 3,389.8
lbs. of steam per hour under actual conditions or 3472 lbs. from and at
212° Fah. Assuming an evaporation of 9 lbs. of water per pound of coal,
this is equivalent to 386 lbs. of coal per hour. If the plant be in opera-
tion 165 days during the year at 20 hours per day the coal loss would be
equal to 636.9 tons which at $3.25 per ton represents a yearly loss of
$2,069.92. If by covering the pipes with hair felt 1 inch thick the loss
may be reduced to 0.152 then the $2,069.92 will be reduced to $314.63
resulting in a saving of $1,755.29. This amount capitalized at 5% repre-
sents an investment of $35,105.80. The cost of 1-inch hair felt covering as
submitted in the bids was less than $3,500.
It is proper in conclusion to direct attention to the wisdom of the
Board of Control and their Medical Superintendent in entering upon these
tests. Not only were the results of material advantage to them in
awarding a large contract but they will also be of value to the public
for whose benefit they are published.
TEST OF A LONG DISTANCE ELECTRIC RAILWAY.
The question of long distance electric railways is gradually assuming
such importance that a brief resume1 of the results of a recent test of the
Mt. Clemens Rapid Railway may be of interest. The test was made by
Messrs. Marquardt, Grace, Parrott, and Fitzgerald of the senior engineer-


The Technic.
ing class, and forms the subject of their graduation thesis, from which
the following results are abstracted.
The distance from Mt. Clemens to Detroit is 21 miles, but only 16J^
miles are supplied with current from the main power house. The track
is almost a dead level and is built of 70-pound T rails. The power house
is located in the center of the portion of track to which it supplies the
electrical current. The service is so arranged that only two cars are being
supplied with current from the power house at any time, and of these one
is always on one side of the power house while the other is on the other
_side. Two feeders extend each way from the power house, one 3J^ miles
and the other 1% miles. The following table gives some of the results of
a 12-hour test:
Total weight of car and motor, pounds 32,415

If it be assumed that there is a loss of 20 per cent, in transmitting the
current and that the average efficiency of the car motors is 80 per cent,
then the ratio of the useful work at the car axle to the indicated work in
the steam engine is as 45 to 100. Allowing 10 per cent, for engine friction
in a locomotive it follows that the stationary engine of this electric railway
plant must be twice as efficient as a locomotive engine in order to show
the same coal consumption.
READING AND INDEXING.
BERNARD L. GREEN, '91.
At the time the engineers' reading room was newly established, too
few of the engineering students took advantage of that excellent collection
of technical periodicals to regularly read and keep posted in their chosen
profession. I hope this has changed since that time, but I want to urge


121
upon all prospective engineers the importance of this reading and of
adopting some form of index rerum in which to file references to articles
worthy of note so encountered.
Progress is the watchword in all branches of science, and the engineer
must adopt it for his own and keep abreast of the times. To this end a
systematic reading of the scientific journals and a careful study of current
engineering literature is of most valuable assistance.
The advantages offered by the engineers' reading room and the college
library cannot be too fully appreciated. After leaving college, the young
engineer will probably not be able to keep a large collection of books with
liim, and will not have access to all the various technical periodicals.
But he should subscribe to at least one good engineering journal, and, by
reading it regularly and carefully, keep in touch with others of his pro-
fession.
But while he has the advantage offered at college for thorough and
systematic reading, he should set apart time to read beyond his text-books
and to become as fully posted as possible upon all that is at present taking
place in the engineering world; and he should start a system of indexing
notes and references which, if properly kept up, cannot fail to be of ines-
timable value. There are few engineering students who cannot find time
for this reading, busy as their college work may make them.
It has been my intention to address the engineering students of
Michigan University more at length through these columns, to urge atten-
tion to these two points, viz., the careful reading of the technical papers
and the adoption of some good system of index as an aid to the memory
to be used freely in connection with this reading. But on looking over
my own index rerum, I found a reference to a paper entitled "Reading
and Indexing," by Prof. Ira O. Baker, in the annual publication of the
Civil Engineers' Club of the University of Illinois for the year 1889 -90. I
re-read this paper and found these two points so strongly and ably argued
and altogether so much better treated than I can hope to treat them, that
I cannot do better than strongly advise every engineering student to read
the paper and profit by it.
It was upon reading this paper, during my college days, that I started
an index rerum, and I have many a time since had cause to rejoice that I
did so. I adopted the card index which Prof. Baker advocates, and find
in it many advantages which other forms could not offer. It is simple and
easy to handle, both when filing and consulting, and it allows of unlimited
expansion in any and all directions without taking any more room than
that occupied by the indexed cards. In this latter point it differs most
commendably from any book form, in which the matter under B, for
instance, is very likely to fill all its allotted space and slop over into X


27ie Technic.
before the space for C matter is half filled. Its one objection is its lack of
portability, an important one to the young engineer. But this objection
can be so largely eliminated by proper arrangement as not to outweigh
the many advantages.
But, though it is important to choose the system that promises the
greatest usefulness, the main point is to start some system of the kind and
form a regular habit of putting into it, carefully classified for ready refer-
ence, any and all information and notes that appear worthy of preserva-
tion or that promise to be of future use. Such a habit will help cultivate
the habit of reading, which is no less valuable.
STRENGTH OF WELDS.
M. E. COOLEY.
Experiments showing the strength of welded joints are always of
interest to the engineer. Of a number of specimens which were tested a
year ago not one broke in the weld ; as some of these were slightly larger
at the weld a new set of specimens were prepared, a cut being taken from
each in the lathe to reduce the pieces to a uniform diameter throughout
their length between the jaws of the testing machine. The welds were
made by Mr. Thomas Orr, instructor in forging in the Engineering Lab-
oratory. Common round iron was used. Three bars were taken at ran-
dom, 1J4, 1 and %-inch diameter. From each bar four specimens were
prepared, one solid, one lap-welded, one butt-welded and one split-welded.
The tests were made by Mr. J. Kahn. The results show that only two
specimens, both lap-welded, broke at or near the weld; the fracture in one
case was slightly crystalline, in the other fibrous. The strength in no
case departed widely from the strength of the solid bar.
These tests indicate that with welds made by a skilfull smith we may
expect to realize nearly or quite the full strength of the original bar.
NOTES ON A NEW PROCESS FOR FINING STEEL.
GEORGE F. KEY.
These notes are intended to give the readers of the Technic a some-
what definite idea of a recently patented process for fining steel. The
inventor claims to be able, practically, to produce from the ore or the pig
iron, every grade of metal from essentially pure iron to highly carbonized
steel.
The points of vantage for this process over other processes producing

like results are, (a) the material does not need to be of certain fixed pro-
portions in order that the process may be successfully applied; (b) sim-
plicity and easy and perfect control of apparatus; (c) the theory of the
process is fully upheld by chemical theory.
The apparatus is a combination of the ordinary cupola and a specially
designed furnace combining the salient points of a reverberatory and a
puddling furnace. The pig iron is melted in the cupola from which it
runs into a "hot-well" on the top of the special furnace. This "hot-well"
is so designed as to hold about one ton of molten metal and to deliver the
same to the furnace in a thin broad sheet the width of the furnace. This
falling sheet of metal is acted on by a hot top-blast, by the products of
combustion from the fuel, and by a series of jets of superheated steam.
The chemical theory of the reactions in the furnace are about as fol-
lows: Tlie steam is disassociated, the oxygen combining with iron pro-
ducing ferric-oxide, this in turn gives up its oxygen to the impurities
forming various oxides that appear as slag and are removed, or appear as
gases and are burned out. The hydrogen of the steam combines with
oxygen from the top-blast making water which gives an extremely intense
heat.
The action in the furnace is very rapid and a large amount of metal
can be handled in a comparatively short time.
Practical tests with this process have proven beyond question its
commercial value, one result being to produce very good tool steel from
gray foundry iron.
The proportions of air delivered by the hot top-blast is about 3,000
cubic feet per ton of metal treated. The amount of steam is approximately
60 pounds per ton of metal, and for the purpose of keeping the slag basic,
about 100 pounds of burnt lime per ton of metal is used in the furnace.
The following features are claimed for this process: (a) simplicity of
operation and the consequent cheapness of production; (b) the excellent
physical properties and the varied adaptability of the product to commer-
cial uses; (c) reduction of special and high priced labor.
Some of the physical features are: (a) almost perfect welding proper-
ties; (b) fineness and closeness of the grain; (c) uniformity of composi-
tion; (d) almost perfect fluidity, allowing of casting any form of mould
with perfect results.
These will no doubt be a decided advantage to the designer of bridges,
large buildings, and machinery when he finds he can have special pieces
cast to suit his particular needs and not have to depend on rolled shapes.
The process has the endorsement of several chemists and metalurgists
of unquestioned ability and is pronounced by them as being a rational and
practical one.


Although it is not probable that this process will supplant the exist-
ing methods of producing the various classes of steel, yet it cannot fail to
materially produce modifications which will be to their decided advantage
and consequently to the production of a better grade of material.
The writer had been in hopes to have given a table of a series of tests
but lack of time for preparation and press of other business has prevented,
however, should any one of the readers of the Technic desire more
specific information he will furnish what he is able.
THE RELATIVE COST OF IRON AND COPPER AS AN
ELECTRIC CONDUCTOR.
J. R. ALLEN, '92.
The recent application of electricity to elevated roads has made pos-
sible the use of a very heavy conductor for the feeding wires. We natu-
rally ask the question, can not some cheaper material than copper be
used? The products of iron being the cheapest available metals, we
turn to them to find a substitute for copper. The table accompanying
this article shows the relative cost of copper in cents per pound as
compared with wrought iron, Bessemer steel and cast iron in dollars
per ton. The comparison is made for conductors having equivalent carry-

ing capacity. In using Bessemer steel rails for conductors it is possiHe to
use those that are winding and imperfect. Such rails may be purchased
at a greatly reduced price. Let us consider the saving that can be made
by the use of Bessemer rails, assuming the rails to cost $25.00 per ton, as
compared with copper at 11 cents per pound. Let the current to be trans-
mitted be 1,000 amperes at 500 volts and the distance it is to be transmitted
be three miles with 5 per cent, drop in voltage.
Cost of copper conductors, $39,000.00
Cost of Bessemer steel conductors, 23,711.00

Deducting $400.00 per mile for bonding 1,200.00

The first use of steel rails as conductors was on the intramural road
at the World's Fair. The Metropolitan Elevated Road of Chicago has
also adopted steel rails as conductors.

The Technic.
EDITORIALS.
The fact that The Technic is ready for distribution before commence-
ment this year, is due to a large amount of hustling on the part of the
Technic Board. The addition of the Register of the Engineering Alumni
has cost a vast amount of additional work, but a timely start and well
organized effort has demonstrated the fact that it may be gotten out in
time if work is begun early in the college year and kept up constantly
until the annual is completed.
* * *
Few changes have been made in the general character of The Technic.
The omission of the customary biography, and the addition of the History
of our New Department, by Prof. Greene, will, we think, coming at this
time, commend itself to our readers. The forming of the New Depart-
ment of Engineering has exerted a great influence on the Engineering
Society and The Technic. Never before have these two factors of college
life been in a more prosperous condition. Never before has there seemed
such a close union between Faculty and students, and every effort has
been made to make the meetings of the Society and the publication of
The Technic a success.
* * *
One notable feature contributing much to the success of the Engineer-
ing Society meetings are the lectures given by prominent engineers who
appear before the Society in response to invitations from members of our
Engineering Faculty. This feature cannot be too highly commended, and
we desire at this time to thank those members of the Faculty, who have
shown such interest, for the efforts they have made. We trust that it may
continue next year. We think that the Society has shown, by its attend-
ance, full appreciation of those efforts.

room was presented to the Society by the Pacific Flush Tank Co. and the

In presenting to you the Register of the Engineering Alumni, we feel
that we may be excused if we show a little pardonable pride in this part
of our work. We have endeavored to make it as complete as possible,
and as to our success in this attempt we will allow the Register to speak
for itself. The addresses given may be relied upon as being correct. It
has taken a large amount of work to make it what it is, but now that we
have succeeded in getting something authentic, we hope it may be kept
complete. If members of the Alumni will kindly assist us in this matter,
notifying us of any change of address, or occupation, The Technic will
engage to keep the Register complete. Kindly let this be kept in mind.
The Engineering Reading Room has been unusually well patronized
this year. A great number of the leading engineering publications are
found on our tables and a movement is now on foot to secure one or two
more of the best publications issued. Our library continues to grow,
several volumes having been added by the Society itself, besides a num-
ber of books and pamphlets presented by Prof. Greene and Miss Chapin,
whom we desire to thank most heartily for this interest. Engineering
Alumni should bear in mind that they can do us no greater favor than by
sending us any duplicate copies of technical books and pamphlets, photo-
graphs, blueprints, etc., which they may possess.
* * *
Questions have come to us from time to time, from members of the
Alumni, members of the Faculty, and students, as to whether The
Technic might not be issued quarterly. This can be done if our Alumni
will take hold of the matter and send us articles of interest without solici-
tation. A large amount of time is wasted in securing contributions.
Send in anything you may have that will be of iuterest and rest assured
it will be appreciated. The issuing of The Technic quarterly would
require a small annual fee to be charged each subscriber or member,
probably about one dollar per year, thus doing away with the old system
of graduate membership. We will leave this matter in the hands of the
Alumni. An expression of your views on the_matter is solicited at once.
Address all correspondence to The Technic.

We are under obligations to Prof. C. G. Taylor for the photographs of
the Engineering buildings, which accompany Prof. Greene's article.


The Technic.
If any one ever had any doubt as to the standing of the University of
Michigan engineers in* the engineering world, a careful perusal of the
Register will soon clear it away. We feel that the University may well
be proud of the showing made by its graduates, and that the Register will
be a big advertisement for the Engineering Department.
* * *
We are pleased to note among recent publications a neat little volume
entitled Architectural Engineering, by J. K. Freitag, class of '90. Engi-
neering Contract) and Specifications, by J. B. Johnson, '78, and Turbines,
by Prof. DeVolson Wood. We trust that these books will soon find their
way to our Engineering Library shelves.
* • *
We beg leave to acknowledge receipt of Cassier's Magazine, which
the publishers have kindly sent us this year. Judging from the way it is
used, it is among oar most popular periodicals, and several subscriptions
must result from its being placed upon our table. May it long continue
there.
