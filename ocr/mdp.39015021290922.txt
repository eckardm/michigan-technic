The shape of flight
The shapes of things that fly have always been
determined by the materials they are made of.
Feathers form wings that are basically
alike for all birds—and membrane forms an
entirely different wing for insects. It takes
thousands of years, but nature improves its
materials and shapes, just as technology
improves the materials and shapes of aircraft.
But here, the improvements in materials are so
rapid that designs become obsolete almost as
soon as they are functional.
Today, our aeronautical designers and missile
experts work with types of materials that
didn't exist just a few short years ago.
Steels are probably the most important examples:
United States Steel has just
developed five new types of steel for the
missile program. They are called "exotic"
steels because they have the almost unbelievable
qualities necessary for unearthly flights.
The shape and the success of our space birds
depend on steel. If you would like to get facts

The Big Book Racket
Once each semester an unchanging drama appears
without fail on the local scene under titles ranging
from "The Big Book Racket" to "Money, Money,
Whose Got the Money?" From time to time the
plot varies from an art known as misleading adver-
tising to an extreme known in the auto industry as
planned obsolesence. Although this is "legitimate
theater" and nothing dishonest is implied, the fact
remains that the performance costs the captive aud-
ience thousands of extra dollars each year.
Of course, what has been referred to somewhat
in jest is nevertheless an important and expensive
process that each student faces at least twice each
year—the buying and selling of books. At first this
process might be passed off lightly but the fact that
15,000 students buy $30 worth of books each semes-
ter—both conservative estimates—reveals a business
that probably surpasses the million dollar a year
mark. But of course, this itself proves nothing—any
person has the right to operate a profitable business.
On the other hand things such as misleading adver-
tising and new editions, which were hinted at in
the opening paragraphs and are elaborated on be-
low, change the situation somewhat. A number of
these factors when combined might well be labeled
"the unplanned conspiracy of publishers, bookstores,
and authors."
The first part of this plot, which is probably more
irritating than anything else, starts with the well-
published advertisement of one local establishment
that reads "we buy books whether used again or
not." It is somewhat of a mild shock to the unsus-
pecting student to find that this ad is often backed
up—for twenty-five cents. There is the possibility
that the book may be worth no more than that but
this is not what the ad leads one to believe.
Now let us shift our thoughts to those men who
we could not do without—the authors—and a pro-
cess known as planned obsolesence in the auto in-
dustry but which goes under the title of the new
edition in the book business. We are in no way
indicting the large majority of faculty members
who are attempting to improve their books but in-
stead the minority who come out with new editions
of texts after two or even one year. Again it is
somewhat of a shock to find that in many of these
cases only the problems have been changed.
However, these situations are only minor prob-
lems compared to the unexcusable lack of foresight
used by some departmental staffs in deciding to use
a text book and then dropping it after one or two
semesters (when no change in the scope and aim
of the course is made). There is no need to list
any of the many specific examples of this situation
since most students who have been here for several
years have already been caught by this "big switch"
once, twice, or even three times. Often the state-
ment is made that it is impossible to evaluate a text
until after it has been used, but this seems to be a
rather lame excuse. Several days spent in checking
the proposed text carefully, possibly with the aid
of several students who have just completed the
course, would be of great help in evaluating a new
book. Or if it is imperative to use the book in a
class why not test it during summer school so that
relatively few students are affected.
Then comes the question of ever-rising book costs.
Of course, no one outside the business can say
whether they are justified or not. Even with the
figures before us this question might remain un-
answered. Nevertheless, the book stores and pub-
lishers may actually be cutting their own throats.
The inefficient and ineffective Student Book Ex-
change may be an indication of things to come. On
the engineering scene the establishment of a special
buy-sell bulletin board put up by one of the ME
student groups may be the forerunner of depart-
mental book exchanges operated by technical so-
cieties or departmental honoraries.
Taken individually these factors may seem un-
important but taken together they form an almost
unbeatable opponent. Only recently have steps such
as those mentioned above been taken. Still the future
is not bright. Against persuaders such as the new
edition, etc. the captive audience will continue to
return for performance after performance.

This month's cover by Mary Grubbs exhibits the inner structure of the earth—the Moho.
As advanced as science is today, it seems rather strange to realize that man knows little of
the earth he lives on. The article "The Mohole" discusses some of the scientific advances in
the understanding of our earth and its structure.

Rene Descartes... on the light of reason
"Hence we must believe that all the sciences are
so interconnected, that it is much easier to study
them all together than to isolate one from all the
others. Therefore, if anyone wishes to search out
the truth of things in earnest, he should not select
any one special science; for all the sciences are con-
joined with each other and interdependent: let
him think only about how to increase the natural
light of reason, not in order to solve this or that
difficulty of a scholastic nature, but that his under-
standing may direct his will to its proper choice in
every contingency of life."

LONG GERMANIUM DENDRITES, grown by a new technique developed in the Westinghouse
Solid State Physics Laboratory, are here inspected by Dr. A. I. Bennett, research physicist.
The Solid State Lab helps you when
your idea needs a new semiconductor
The Solid State Physics Laboratory helps Westinghouse
engineers exploit the rich phenomena of the solid state.
Problems are solved in low temperature and semicon-
ductor physics, and magnetic and ferroelectric materials.
If an engineer's idea requires a new kind of semicon-
ductor, this group may be able to develop it for him.
This laboratory is staffed by 27 Ph.D.'s, 4 M.S.'s,
and 7 B.S. junior engineers. Here's one way it ties in
with work at operating divisions:
The Air Arm Division is now developing super-
miniaturized electronic systems
Our Youngwood plant is designing the new devices
needed for these systems
The Solid State Physics Lab is perfecting a method
for growing the dendritic material needed to make
these devices
The young engineer at Westinghouse isn't expected to
know all of the answers. Our work is often too advanced
for that. Each man's work is backed up by specialists—
like the men in this Solid Stale Physics Lab. Even tough
problems are easier to solve with this kind of help.
If you've ambition and real ability, you can have a
rewarding career with Westinghouse. Our broad product
line, decentralized operations, and diversified technical
assistance provide hundreds of challenging opportunities
for talented engineers.

TECHNOLOGY

FOR
TOMORROW
Sputniks, transistors, H-bombs . . . these were
big achievements of the Fabulous Fifties. Now
on the eve of a new decade a Technic senior
editor examines a few of the breakthroughs,
changes, and discoveries . . . including those
events "just around the corner" and some "long
shots" . . . that will make the Sixties the most
important ten years in history.
by BARRY L. PEEBLES
Associate Editor
On October 4, 1957 a long slender
missile rose from a remote launch-
ing pad deep within the Soviet Union
destined to place in orbit around the
earth a small metallic sphere—which
soon become known the world over as
Sputnik I.
This event—more than any other—
symbolizes the rapidly expanding and far
reaching growth of technology during
the Fifties.
Now in the final months of 1959 and
on the eve of a new decade the big ques-
tion is: What is the forecast during the
Sixties for this technological era that
was born with the demands of World
War II and grew with the boom of the
Fifties?
This is the question that will be ex-
amined in the following paragraphs.
Problems Arise
Of course, certain problems arise when
one attempts to look into the future and
predict the unpredictable. As there were
in the Fifties, there should be a number
of unbelieveable and unpredictable ad-
vances or discoveries during the Sixties.
These might be compared to such totally
unforseen events in the Fifties as the fall
of the parity principle in physics, the
discovery of radiation bands around the
earth, the discovery of tranquilizers, or
the development of the "area rule" for
design of supersonic aircraft.
On the other hand observers in 1949
could be fairly sure that such things as
commercial jet flights, color TV, ther-
monuclear explosions (H-bomb), nu-
clear powered submarines, and transistors
10

would become a reality during the Fifties.
A glance at the chart on page 20 shows
many other advances and leaves little
doubt that these past ten years have
been one of the most important periods,
if not the most important, in the history
of the world. But this brings back the
original question about the Sixties—
where do we go from here?
The answer: Bigger, better, and more
technological expansion and growth than
any time in history. The big reason: the
United States will spend more for re-
search and development in the coming
decade than the total it has spent in all
the years combined since 1776. What's
more, this amount—which will top
$120,000,000,000— is more than double
the amount spent during the so-called
"fabbulous" Fifties. There should be no
doubting that this doubling of funds for
the backbone of progress—research and
development—will bring more scientific
and technical surprises in the Sixties than
ever dreamed of in the Fifties.
With these figures in mind let's take
a closer look at just what we can expect
in the Sixties — including those things
just "around the corner," others that are
likely in the mid-Sixties and also some
"long shots" for the late Sixties.
Consumer Goods
Most people, in their role as consumers,
have more interest in the applications of
recent breakthroughs to products they
can buy in the store. Many recent soon-
to-come applications — such as thermo-
electricity, ultrasonics, electroluminesence
—surely will have a direct bearing on
the lives we live, so let's see how and
when.
Without a doubt the early Sixties will
see at least one of three energy conver-
sion systems—-thermoelectricity, thermo-
ionic conversion, fuel cells—used in
practical applications. Most advanced of
the three is thermoelectricity (Technic,
Feb. 1959), mainly due to the efforts of
Westinghouse. Using special alloys and
semiconductors it is now possible to di-
rectly convert heat to electricity without
any moving parts. Of course, the effi-
ciency of about 10% that is obtained is
much too low to compete with commer-
cial power generators of today but it
might be high enough for small auxiliary
plants or for use in remote locations.
The big hope is that someday thermo-
electricity will be adapted for use with
nuclear reactors.
General Electric, on the other hand,
sees a limited future in thermoelectricity
and is placing its money on a thermo-
ionic converter—a device that "boils
electrons off" a heated metal surface to
provide an electric current. Little is
known of its possibilities but they do
not look especially bright at the present.
Still another company, Union Carbide,
is working on a third energy converter,
the fuel cell. This device uses a fuel
such as hydrogen or alcohol which is
passed over a catalytic surface to cause
combustion and a current flow. Early
indications are that "fuel cells" already
have an efficiency comparable to storage
batteries.
Another development that is already
being used in industry and should soon
have consumer application is ultrasonics
(Technic, Jan. 1957). Ultrasonic de-
vices use a very high frequency sound
vibration (inaudible) for such purposes
as cleaning and drilling. Westinghouse
expects to have a ultrasonic dishwasher
ready in the early sixties with clothes
washers not too far behind.
By far one of the brightest possibili-
ties—and one that has been talked about
for some time—is the use of electro-
luminesence {Technic, Feb. 1957) in
wall panels for light, heat, and even
cooling. These panels use a thermoelec-
tric principle opposite to that mentioned
before. In this case electric current
passed through a junction of two metals
causes heat to flow from one side to the
other. Thus a room can be either heated
or cooled. Light is also given off from
some of these semiconductor materials
when electrons return to their original
position after being boosted to a high
energy level. Westinghouse reports that
not only will electroluminesence make
possible walls that take care of all
heat, light, and air conditioning but it
will also pave the way for large mural
type wall TV screens (but not until the
late Sixties).
Almost bound to be extended is the
long line of synthetic fibers that started
with orlon in 1950, dacron in 1953 and
continued with such things as acrilin,
verel, zafran, etc. Next in line: kodal,
teron, and hundreds of others.
Development of food irradiation has
been sluggish up till now—mainly be-
cause industry has been dragging its feet
—but should pick up soon with the Army

MOHOLE
The Mohole ... a hole to the Moho . . . was
first proposed in jest but is now being backed
by the world's leading scientists.
by ROCKY STONE, '60E
Ever hear of AMSOC—the American
Miscellaneous Society? Probably not,
since AMSOC has less than 50 members
and no dues, records, laws, officers or
regular meetings. Meetings that do occur
are usually held at Washington parties
if there is a two member quorum present.
Typical agenda topic: How to tow Ant-
arctic icebergs north and use the melted
water to irrigate southern California.
It appears that AMSOC was founded
and kept alive by a group of alphabet-
weary scientists merely for the laughs it
provided. That is, until one problem be-
gan to gain international interest and the
backing of the National Academy of
Sciences. The project: Drilling a hole
through the earth's crust, through the
Mohorovicic Discontinuity (or Moho as it
is called) and into the earth's mantle—-
which comprises more than 80% of the
earth. True to form, AMSOC has labeled
the projected hole the MOHOLE.
Receives Support
Shortly after the first mention of this
project at a typical AMSOC meeting it
suddenly received the support of the
International Union of Geodesy and Geo-
physics, the National Academy of Sci-
ences, and the National Science Founda-
tion. Committees were cjuickly formed
and preliminary studies made. Available
equipment was studied and funds were
secured. The result: MOHOLE will be a
reality during the early or mid-Sixties.
At first it may appear that someone—
namely AMSOC—has succeeded in liter-
ally pulling the wool over someone's eyes.
Such is not the case because there are
several very sound and important scien-
tific reasons for drilling a MOHOLE.
The main one is, of course, to find out
just what the mantle is composed of and
validate certain theories about the earth's
interior. A second and intermediate, but
equally important, reason is to obtain a
fabulous history book covering two bil-
lion years by studying a continuous core
sample of sediment if the MOHOLE is
drilled through the ocean floor (as it
will be).
However, before the immense import-
ance of these reasons can be compre-
hended or the method of reaching the
Moho understood, a small amount of
background information is necessary.
First of all, it is true that a great deal
of information is known about the earth's
crust and its interior—but most of the
information is based on indirect evidence.
For example, astronomy gives informa-
tion about mass, density, and moment of
inertia; geology, the distribution, compo-
sition and movements of the internal
structure; physics, the strength, conductiv-
ity, and plasticity. Radiochemistry, seis-
mic, magnetic, and heat-flow studies all
provide additional information about the
mantle but again by indirect means.
Grand Hypothesis
From all of this information the geo-
physicist has come up with a grand hy-
pothesis combining all of this informa-
tion. What it boils down to is this: The
crust is composed of thick, comparatively
light sheets of granite about 20 miles
thick (the continents) separated by thin-
ner denser basalt about 2l/2 miles deep
(the ocean basins). Even though the
ocean basins are covered by 2y2 miles
of water and Yj mile of sediment it can
be seen why the MOHOLE will be drilled
here—the crust is thinner and the Moho
is closer to the surface.
Turning back to the grand hypothesis,
we find that beneath the crust and sep-
arated from the crust by the Moho —
named for Seismologist A. Mohorovicic
who discovered it in 1919—is the mantle,
a layer of silicates and nickel-iron about
1800 miles deep. The core, which is
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


posed mainly of nickel-iron.
This was not always man's conception
of the earth's interior, however. For many
years it was believed that the center of
the earth was liquid because volcanoes
spewed forth molten lava. Lord Kelvin
squelched this theory when a study of
tides led him to believe that the center
was solid instead of liquid and was
actually more rigid than steel. He added
that the center had probably once been
liquid, cooled to a solid and was still
cooling.
Now, however, some modern geophys-
ists believe that the earth is actually heat-
ing up instead of cooling down. Meas-
urements of heat flow to the surface and
of radioactivity may mean that more heat
is being generated by radioactive ma-
terials than is being lost at the surface.
This is type of question that the MO-
HOLE may answer.
Objectives
With this background let's review in
more detail the principle objectives of
the MOHOLE project and then examine
the methods and problems of drilling a
hole two miles deeper than any hole ever
drilled before. Briefly the objectives
could be stated as follows:
1) obtain samples of the mantle and

4) Take a continuous core sample of
the sediment.
Elaboration of this final objective would
be well worth while for in the words of
the Moholemen, "These sediments may be
the most fabulous history book of all
time; they could contain an uninterrupted
record of the earth's development for
two billion years." First of all, this his-
tory book can give the magnetic history
of the earth since tiny particles of mag-
netic minerals line up with the earth's
field as they settle. Second, the core will
show the climatic history of the earth by
measuring the core's calcium carbonate
content. Since the solubility of calcium
carbonate varies with temperature a direct
relationship with the earth's climate can
be obtained.

One of the outstanding new
writers on the Technic staff this
fall is "Rocky" Stone '60E (he
refuses to reveal his real first name).
Although Rocky is in his fourth
year at Michigan he is still uncer-
tain which field he will major in
even though he has already been
enrolled in most of the engineer-
ing departments.
In his spare time Rocky partici-
pates in sports or reads—his favor-
ites being classical Greek literature
and Micky Spillane novels.
Third, and most important, will be the
paleontograph (fossil) study of the core.
Today such studies give man a fairly
complete record of life back to the start
of the Cambrian or Paleozoic era (about
515 million years ago). However, in rela-
tion to the estimated two billion year
life of the earth, the 515 million years
studied is relatively small. It is quite
possible that the deep-sea sediments con-
tain the rest of the record.
Also, it is always possible that the drill-
ers will strike a point at the bottom edge
of the sediment where atmosphere and
water caused the first erosion and then
the first sedimentation. Underneath this
first sediment may be a moonlike surface,
possibly filled with meteorite craters, that
was the face of the earth before the
atmosphere as present.
Where, How, When
Turning now from the theoretical back-
ground and the main objectives, the big
questions are where, how and when.
The "where" is definitely going to be
over an ocean basin because, as men-
tioned, the crust is thinner and the Moho
is closer to the surface that it is on the
continents. Even with the problems of
drilling from a barge it will be easier
than trying to drill through a 20 mile
granite crust on one of the continents.
The exact location should be one where
some seismic gravity and heat-flow stud-
ies had been made. It should also be
one that is relatively free of rough water,
hurricanes, freezing surface, etc. To the
experts this brings to mind at least two
locations—one about 200 miles North of

THERMOCOUPLE
The direct conversion of nuclear energy to
electrical energy is now possible with this new
device.
by RAY IKOLA, '62E
Early this spring a group at the Los
Alamos Scientific Laboratory, with
the assistance of a U-M professor, paved
the way for interplanetary space travel
and economical nuclear power plants
with the development of a device that,
for the first time, converts nuclear energy
directly to electricity.
This device, known as the plasma
thermocouple and developed with the aid
of Robert W. Pidd of the physics de-
partment, is based on the principle of the
fairly common temperature-measuring
thermocouples with one big exception—
the junction of two metals in the ordi-
nary thermocouple is replaced by a
junction of a metal and gas. However,
before looking into the operation of this
device it might be well to first review
the underlying principles of thermo-
couples.
Thermocouples Not New
Thermocouples have been in use now
for quite some time. Currently they are
used mainly for temperature measure-
ment and control. The thermocouples
used up to this time, however, have con-
sisted of two different metals joined
together at two ends. One junction is
heated while the other junction is kept
cool. This set of conditions causes an
electric current to flow in the circuit. The
strength of the current produced is de-
pendent on the properties of the metal
used and the difference in temperature
between the hot and cold junctions. Since
the strength of the current is dependent
on the temperature difference, the ther-
mocouple is readily adapted to purposes
of temperature measurement simply by
measuring the variations in the current
as the temperature at one of the junctions
changes. For a more complete discussion
of thermoelectricity, the reader is referred
to the February, 1959 issue of the Mich-
igan Tecbnic.
Gas Replaces One Metal
The plasma thermocouple operates on
the same principle as the conventional
bi-metallic devices. However, one of the
metals is replaced by cesium gas. What
is the advantage of the cesium gas re-
placement? The advantage stems from
the fact that every metal has a certain
characteristic thermal driving force which
is known as the "thermoelectric power."
The driving force of the cesium gas

Now a^ sophomore at the Uni-
versity, Ray is working toward a
B.S. degree in electrical engineer-
ing. Besides writing many Tecbnic
articles, Ray was also recently
named Publicity Chairman of the
Playboys' Prance.
Being an EE major, it is natural
for him to follow such interests as
amateur radio and hi-fi systems.
Likewise, he has been a staff an-
nouncer at a hometown (Ishpem-
ing) radio station for several years.

complete plasma thermocouple, approx-
imately twice actual size, as it was used
in the Los Alamos experiment to pro-
duce electric power directly from fission
heat.
(plasma) is about 1,000 times greater
than any other metal. This means that
the plasma thermocouple is able to be
operated much more efficiently than the
conventional thermocouples.
The actual construction of the plasma
thermocouple is simplicity itself. In out-
ward appearance it resembles an empty
frozen fruit juice can. Suspended in the
center of this can is a small rod about
one-fourth inch in diameter and three-
fourths inch long which contains uranium
carbide. Surrounding this source of pow-
er is the ionized cesium gas. Between
the outer shell and the plasma is another
shell which contains a circulating oil
coolant. See Fig. 1. To put the thermo-
couple into operation, it is placed in the
core of a nuclear reactor. The neutron
flux causes uranium fission in the center
of the can, thereby heating it to a high
temperature. The circulating coolant near
the outside of the can keeps the plasma
at a relatively low temperature. Thus, the
basic requirements of a thermocouple are
met and electricity is produced.
Surprising Results
The thermocouple was first tested on
April 4, 1959. At that time its perform-
ance completely surpassed all expectations
of the scientists. It had been expected
that enough power would be produced
by the test device to light an electric bulb
for a few minutes. However, the life of
the thermocouple was almost twelve
hours. The open circuit voltage was 3.S
volts and it had a short circuit current
between 30 and 40 amperes.
It is seen, then, that electrical energy
can be produced directly from nuclear
energy through the use of this plasma
thermocouple. But you may ask, wherein
does the advantage of this device lie?
Basically the advantage is one of size
and cost of a power source. The elimi-
nation of the boilers and turbine-gener-
ators that are found in today's nuclear
power plants obviously reduces the size
and at the same time reduces the cost
of the power plant.
To emphasize the importance of this
development Dr. Pidd stated shortly after
the first test that, "The plasma thermo-
couple will cut by perhaps one-half the

present cost of building power reactors;
pave the way for interplanetary space
travel because of the possible tremendous
reduction in fuel deadweight loads now
necessary to propel a rocket into space;
enable satellites to have a small but
comparatively powerful and long-lasting
source of electricity with which to tele-
meter data back to earth; and have great
significance in submarine propulsion."
However, Dr. Pidd also emphasized that
it would probably be from three to five
years before a commercial reactor utiliz-
ing this process could be constructed
because there is usually that much of a
lag between science and engineering.
Development of the plasrna thermo-
couple was a three year project at Los
Alamos led by the rocket propulsion re-
search division. The men primarily re-
sponsible for its success are group leader
George Grover, Duane Roehling, and
Earnest Salmi of the Laboratory staff,
and Dr. Pidd who served as a consultant
to the project.
Although the plasma thermocouple is
still in the development stage, it should
have great economic significance in the
future because of the huge power reserves
of uranium which are available. At any
rate it surely must be classed as a major
scientific feat—the first direct conversion
of nuclear energy to electrical energy.

explored areas of nuclear physics
gave the United States, by the end of
World War II, the most powerful weapon
ever devised. Since the horrendous ex-
plosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
scientists have continued these studies
with renewed effort trying to develop
techniques whereby the tremendous heat
which brought destruction to Japan could
bring peaceful power to the whole
world. Work has progressed rapidly. To-
day there are several nuclear-powered
reactors in operation, and scores in the
planning stages. By 1961, Michigan will
have its first reactor for commercial pur-
poses. This, the Enrico Fermi Fast Breed-
er Reactor, will be producting steam for
the generation of electricity.
Non-Profit Groups
To complete construction and to carry
on operation of such a frontier venture,
the Power Reactor Development Com-
pany was formed. This group, a non-
profit membership corporation, is re-
sponsible for the reactor portion of the
Fermi Plant. With this responsibility, it
will own and operate the nuclear section.
The membership list includes fourteen
electric power companies and seven man-
ufacturing firms.
Sharing in the reactor portion of the
work is Atomic Power Development As-
sociates, Inc. This is another non-profit
group located in New York State. The
principal function of this organization is
to carry out research, to produce a reactor
design, and to develop and test the re-
actor proper. Plans set forth by them will
serve as basis for the construction work
carried out by Power Reactor Develop-
ment Company. Even after the reactor
is operational, ADPA will continue its
research in order that construction and
operating experience gained from the
Fermi Reactor could be applied to future
power reactor designs.
A third organization engaged in the
Enrico Fermi Reactor project is the De-
troit Edison Company. As an electric
power company, it will build, own, and
operate a conventional 150,000 kilowatt
steam turbine generator facility adjacent
to the PRDC-owned reactor plant. The
steam produced in the nuclear reactor
will be purchased by Detroit Edison and
utilized in the turbine generator. Then
the electricity produced will be distributed
to customers over the existing power
system.
Finally, the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion will have certain responsibilities.
From their work with other power re-
actors, they will bring experts for con-
sultation and assistance in training per-
sonnel. Other authorities in such work
will do some research and development
including the critical experiment and
necessary radiation tests. To assist the
project financially, the AEC will furnish,
free of charge, a five year supply of
fuel. Lastly, their reprocessing plants will
be available to render partly-consumed
fuel available for further use.

Located at Lagoona Beach on the west-
ern Lake Erie shore near Monroe, Mich-
igan, the Enrico Fermi Reactor is nearing
completion. Considering that it is fi-
nanced by private rather than givern-
ment funds, it is surprising that the
purpose of the project is not to produce
electricity on a competitive basis with
coal-produced power, but rather to gain
insight into the techniques and problems
of generating electricity from nuclear
fuel. In a recent stockholder's letter,
Detroit Edison states, 'We believe that
the experience gained in its design and
construction is of inestimable value to
your Company and to all those associated
with this great research and development
effort." It thus appears that private cap-
ital sees enough future in nuclear power
plants to carry on extensive research in
the hope that such plants will become
commonplace more rapidly.
Several Kinds
There are several kinds of nuclear
power reactors. Of these, the breeder
type is one of the more promising, and
it is on the breeder principle that the
Fermi Reactor will operate. Many ex-
perts consider the fast breeder reactor the
most hopeful type for economical nuclear
generation of electricity. This is because
it alone permits full utilization of the
potential heat energy in the nuclear fuel.
In addition, it increases the supply of
fissionable material by producing or
"breeding" a new atomic fuel—pluton-
ium. Lastly the fast breeder reactor uses
the abundant U*38 and thorium fuels.
The thermodynamic cycle is identical
to that of many other experimental and
commercial reactors. Heat produced by
the nuclear reactions occuring in the
reactor core is transferred by conduction
to a primary cooling loop of liquid
sodium. Since this loop passes through
the inside areas of the nuclar pile, the
sodium will be contaminated with radio-
active particles. To assure harmless oper-
ation of the plant, a secondary sodium

loop is employed. In a heat exchanger,
the transfer of heat to the secondary
loop is completed. A second heat ex-
changing arrangement is used to heat
the steam to high temperatures and pres-
sures. Since the generator is of the "once-
through type," steam leaving the gener-
ator at a lower energy state is immedi-
ately recycled through to the secondary
sodium loop.
For the first two years, PRDC will
supply over a million pounds an hour
of steam at 600 psi and 755°F to Detroit
Edison. The latter company will return
water under pressure and at 400 °F.
After this initial period, the quantity,
pressure and temperature will be raised
as the heat output of the reactor is in-
creased.
The core, blanket, and control rods
are arranged in a cylinder eighty inches
in diameter and seventy inches long.
Called subassemblies, these 91 rods are
of various materials depending on their
function. The core rods are of U"8 and
U235. Outside the core is a radial blanket
formed by rods of U238. Last are son^e
steel subassemblies which make up a
thermal shield. Interspersed throughout
these various subassemblies are the con-
trol rods. Many of the rods are tubular
and are interconnected in order that the
sodium coolant may flow through them.
Since the coolant flows directly through
the region where atomic reactions are
occuring, high efficiency is achieved. This
efficiency is enhanced by the high tem-
perature, low pressure cooling system.

Control Rods
As mentioned above there are ten con-
trol rods in and around the reactor
core. They are composed of Boron 10
which has neutron-absorbing properties.
Therefore the operator, by positioning
the rods properly may control the reac-
tion rate. Only two of the control rods
are used for this purpose, however. The
remaining eight are for emergency oper-
ation in the event a runaway reaction
occurs. Should this happen, a scram"
shutdown is carried out. The eight safety
rods have been fitted into barrels and
locked, vertically poised for use. Should
such a shutdown be necessary, gravity
and coil springs accelerate the safety rods
into the core. Once the "scram" button
is pressed, the rods can be in position
within one second.
Core and blanket subassemblies, con-
trol rods and the thermal shield are all
contained in a two-inch thick stainless
steel inner reactor vessel. The thickness
is required for strength, but is also useful
in partially reducing radiation.
Neutron shielding is performed by the
two rows of steel thermal shield rods in-
side the inner reactor vessel and by
permanent concrete cylinders adjacent to
this.
Outside the inner reactor vessel is a
secondary containment vessel. Between
the two are structural members to sup-
port the reactor vessel, the neutron shield-
ing, a gamma ray shield, and neutron
flux counters. The latter are a good in-

and the
POWER STATE
In this prize-winning essay the implications of
the power state are examined in light of an-
cient truths.
by MICHAEL J. PICHEL, '60E
Men of the earliest civilizations had
some premonition of the implica-
tions and consequences of human intel-
lect. According to the Book of Genesis,
man was forbidden to eat the fruit of
the tree of knowledge. Man ate from the
tree, gained his intellect, and was pun-
ished. A Greek myth tells of Prometheus
(Forethought), who stole fire from the
heavens, gave it to man, and was pun-
ished. In Prometheus Bound, the only
extant play of Aeschlus' Prometheus Tril-
ogy, Prometheus describes himself:
I am the huntsman of the
mystery,
The great resource that taught
technology.
The secret font of fire put in
the reed,
And given man to minister his
need.1
Aeschylus somehow had seen the hand-
writing on the wall; for Prometheus, the
"huntsman," a searching intellect, and
source of technology is crucified by the
power of Zeus. Perhaps at this point we
should look more closely at the Prome-
theus Bound.
Prometheus Bound
The reader, or viewer, of the Prome-
theus Bound finds himself gripped by a
sense of history taking place on the edge
of the world. Prometheus is shackled
to a cliff in a desolate gorge by the ab-
stract figures: Might and Force. Prome-
theus' situation quite literally prohibits
him from action, and as though his bond-
age were symbolic of the fact that his
strength had never been a physical one,
our attention is focused on his intellect.
Prometheus suffers because his "love of
mankind was too strong,"2 and, although
he is a god who can defy gods, the
spectator identifies with him.
The shackling of Prometheus, symbol
of intellect and technology, can be viewed
as the "crucifixion of intellectual man,"
and Prometheus becomes a symbol of in-
tellectual man's suffering. The Controller
(Power) and Executive (Force) were
sent by Zeus (symbol of the dictator, the
tyrant, the power state in any of its many
forms) to carry out this crucifixion. Zeus
is punishing Prometheus for stealing fire
from the heavens, and giving it to man-
kind; however, according to the myth,
Zeus is bound for a marriage, a son of
which will overthrow him.3 Therefore,
he needs the Foresight of Prometheus
to tell him which marriage to avoid.
Zeus' method for obtaining the knowl-
edge he needs is to employ more and
more force. Prometheus, "the great re-
source," closes the channels of informa-
tion. The conflict between Zeus and
Prometheus is, therefore, an allegory of
the self-defeating character of power
system which are based on power alone.
The power state has no long-term fu-
ture in a scientific world. Only when it
listens to Prometheus, frees and honors
him can it become stabilized. In doing
so it changes its perspective from tyran-
ny and dictatorship towards a state ruled
upon the consent of the governed.4
Soviet Power State
If we look at the Soviet power state
today we might see the beginnings of
such a stabilization and change of per-
spective. One could see in Stalin the
image of Zeus, isolated and trusting no
one except his Power and Force; yet to-
day we see the tremendous scientific
achievements of the Russians, seemingly
Promethean gifts. Concededly these tech-
nological advances are, to a very great
extent, material symbols of Power and
Force; yet they are based on scientific
knowledge, "the great resource that
taught technology." Simple strength was
subjugated to the procedures of science.
In the extant fragments of Prometheus
Unbound, the second play of the Prome-
theus Trilogy, Zeus and Prometheus, af-
ter 30,000 years of suffering, are recon-
ciled. A compromise between force and
reason is effected; Prometheus learning
the need for some degree of authority
and order, and Zeus learning mercy and
justice.
The subjugation of strength to the pro-
cedures of science (reason) in the U.S.S.R.
may be the embryo of such a reconcil-
iation and compromise. For, in this pow-
er state there is now a group of intel-
IX
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


of freedom in their scientific endeavors.
These are "huntsmen of the mystery."
Their Promethean science requires pre-
vision and long-term calculation. Their
power state has, in at least one respect,
learned a Promethean lesson; for in order
to obtain the knowledge it needs it has
given this group a position of honor,
rather than send Force and Power to
extract the knowledge.
This position of honor, although it
may owe its existence to expediency, has
become real. These scientific individuals
are respected not only by their fellow
men but also by their power state. The
power state cannot avoid this respect be-
cause it realizes that its security, its very
continuance of power depends on the
Promethean intelligence of the scientist.
Here is the beginning of a stabilization
and change of perspective. The power
state has mellowed somewhat, and learned
a Promethean lesson.
Doctor Zhivago
We know that this mellowing and re-
spect is quite restricted. The power state
has given honor only where it could see
an immediate gain for itself. Boris Paster-
nak was, in fact, dishonored by the state
■when, in Doctor Zhivago, he attempted
to teach a Promethean lesson by express-
ing fears and disillusionment concerning
the revolution and the Soviet totalitarian
state which evolved after the revolution."'
However, we know that the scientists, the
intellectuals, will not (for they cannot)
restrict their prevision or long-term cal-
culations to their technological develop-
ment. Their calculations must consider
all dimensions, both scientific and non-
scientific, if they are really to be long-
term.
The short-term calculation concentrates
on one's private interest, the immediate
moment. As the range of one's thoughts
extend the mind asks itself, "What will
this momentary utility mean to my fur-
ther utility, tomorrow and the day after
tomorrow?" This process extends until
the mind imagines the many other rela-
tionships in which "I" will be involved,
and predicts the many actions of others
on which "my" needs will in turn de-
pend. The perspective extends, if pushed
far enough in time length, to the point
where it takes in the city, state, family
of states, and the estate of the unborn.
The conclusion would seem to be that
if man cares to prethink far enough, his
forethought becomes increasingly moral
and philanthropic in its direction.'5
This conclusion is borne out by such
men as Descartes, Alfred North White-
head, Bertrand Russell, Einstein, Pauling,
and all "huntsmen of the mystery" whose
Promethean science required prevision
and long-term calculation. Like Prome-
theus, the scientist has given us fire, "the
technological flame." He has transformed
the heat of the "flame" into power, first
power from steam, power from chemical
reaction, and then the scientist (chemist,
physicist, engineer, and mathematician)
was able to release the heat (energy)
contained in the nucleus of the atom.
This was heat far too great for use. The
"Firegivers" saw that man had never
been able to control the gift with steady
hands, always letting it burn and destroy
him. Fire in the forge was used to make
spears and swords; chemical combustion
was first widely used as gunpowder; the
internal combustion engine carried arm-
ored tanks, airplanes, and warships; and
finally all of the temperatures, all of the
destructive devices that had gone before
were exceeded in the climactic flash and
unimaginable release of energy over Hiro-
shima.
"We shook the tree of knowledge, and
out fell the bomb.7
The source of technology could not
take back his gift, nor did he wish to;
for he was still the "huntsman." Like
Prometheus he realized the implications
of the "flame." "Long since I looked the
issue full in the face,"8 and so he tried
to give mankind direction, other than
technological, in order that his "flame"
could be safely used.
The Promethean scientist thus becomes
a philosopher, a moralist, an altruistic
individual, because his prevision and long-
term calculation tell him of an impend-
ing danger, a danger which is often non-
existent in the short-term view.
We can see this evolution in Linus
Pauling, who has probed deeply into "the
secret fount," and has given us a more
complete, basic, logical concept of the
"nature of the chemical bond." Pauling
received a Nobel Prize for this work.
Like Prometheus, he has seen an im-
pending danger, and is attempting to
warn and direct mankind concerning the
long-term effects of radioactivity, caused
by testing and continued use of atomic
explosions.
Pauling and others like him have met,
and are still meeting, obstacles. The state
(political obstacles) and even his fellow
scientists (social obstacles) would prefer
that he restrict his efforts to the task of
predicting the behavior of physical mat-
ter; just as the Chorus tells Prometheus:
"Your wits do wander in your sore
despite."9
Crucifixion
We see that Prometheus' crucifixion,
"the crucifixion of intellectual man," is
not only inflicted by Zeus (the state) but
also by the Chorus (his fellow men).
The crucifixion becomes symbolic of so-
ciety's resistance to its own intellectuals.
Thus the Promethean myth warns, not
only of the conflict between Intellect and
the political power state, but also of the
conflict between Intellect and what may
be called "the social power state."
This "social power state" refers to:
the discipline of society by means of its
customs and mores, the relations between

ACTIVITIES
For freshmen and upperclassmen alike the
Technic surveys the many engineering activi-
ties.
by MAX LEGATSKI, '6IE
In every division of Michigan's Engi-
neering College there are individuals
seeking "that little bit extra" from their
stay at the University. For those students
having the ambition and the desire to
broaden themselves both technically and
socially, extra-curricular activities are in-
valuable.
For the benefit of upperclassmen as
well as the incoming freshmen, the
Technic presents a sketch of the engi-
neering activities offered at Michigan.
Students interested in one or more of the
following activities should contact a fac-
ulty advisor, a club officer, or a member
of the department affiliated with the ac-
tivity of their interest.
The Engineering Council
The Engineering Council is the co-
ordinating body of the College of Engi-
neering. Its membership consists of mem-
bers at large who are appointed by a
committee of the Council, representatives
of all the technical societies, the editors
of the Michigan Technic and the Arch,
the president of the Engineering Honor
Council, the president of the four Engi-
neering Classes, the president of Tau
Beta Pi, and representatives of honorary
organizations.
Last year the Council sponsored a fac-
ulty evaluation, a dance (Playboy's
Prance), a plaque for the late Dean
George Granger Brown, and Engineers
week-end which was held primarily for
the benefit of residents of the local area
and prospective students. It has also
created a committee to study and make
recommendations to the various societies
on how they can more effectively serve
their purposes and increase membership.
Through these efforts the Council in-
tends to stimulate among other things a
better knowledge of industry and of engi-
neering as a profession.
Officers for this year are Armin Jocz,
President; Rog Barnes, Vice-President;
Charles Hoops, Treasurer; and A. Jenels-
hoff, Secretary.
The Honor Council
The Engineering Honor Council, ad-
ministrators of the Honor Code, has two
main responsibilities — educational and
judicial.
Concerning the educational responsi-
bilities, it is the duty of the Honor Coun-
cil to see that the engineer is made aware
of the many benefits of the Honor Code
and that he understands the mechanics
of its operation. Along this line the
Honor Council carried out an extensive
"educational" program last year, includ-
ing the erection of a bulletin board in
the new Student-Faculty Lounge which
illustrated in detail the benefits of the
Code.
Judicial duties require that the Council
hear cases of reported violations of the
Honor Code, decide on the merits of the
case, and levy a penalty if the student
is guilty. Decisions of the Honor Council
are reviewed by a faculty board, though
no decision has ever been reversed.
The Honor Council is made up of eight
voting members, an alternate member,
and a non-voting ex-officio representative
from Vulcans. Four regular members and
an alternate are chosen each semester.
Technic
The Technic is the oldest engineering
college magazine in America, being en-
tered as second-class matter in 1882.
Though "old and wise," the Technic is
always in need of fresh ideas and new
blood. There is plenty of room for new-
comers.
Many students think that they have to
be a Sinclair Lewis or a Shakespeare to
be on the staff. Actually, although good
writers are always needed, there are many
jobs on the staff which require completely
different types of talent. To mention a
few, there are advertising, circulation,
and illustration. No matter what you're
good at, there's room for you at the
Technic.
Added attractions are the annual steak
dinner held each spring, the annual of-
fice party, and the picnic which is planned
for the near future.
Present editor-in-chief of the Technic
is Chuck Hildebrandt. Senior editors are
Barry Peebles, Mary Ellen DuVall, and
Ron Tesarik. Interested students should
contact Personnel and Public Relations
Director Grace Koepcke or drop by the
office at 3077 East Engineering Building.
Executive Boards
The Executive Boards are the elected
governing and administrative bodies ot'
the freshman, sophomore, and junior
classes in the College of Engineering.
Primarily the Boards organize and spon-
sor activities and projects that will bene-
fit their class. In addition the Boards act
as a liaison body between the students
and the administration.
The Junior Board is busy working out
plans for this year. Included in last year's
activities were an exhibit for Engineer's
Week-end, a sweatshirt sale, and a Cine-
ma Guild movie sponsorship. Ground-
work for this year's plans is still being
laid.
The Arch
The Arch, now starting its fourth year
of publication, is printed with the fol-
lowing objectives in mind: first, to keep
students abreast of College of Engineer-
ing current events, and second, to create
better school spirit.
Copies are distributed free of charge

engineering, production and accounting employees are
assigned to one of 30 Alcoa operating locations through-
out the nation. New sales engineering and sales ad-
ministration employees, after completing a six-month
training program, go to one of Alcoa's 72 sales offices.
If your field is sales development or process develop-
ment, you will be located in New Kensington, Pa., or
Cleveland, Ohio. Main research laboratories are located
in New Kensington, with branches in Cleveland, East
St. Louis, 111., Massena, N. Y., and Chicago.
3. Alcoa has a training program for each new employee.
Engineering and production training involves orienta-
tion and rotation of assignments for approximately one
year. Sales training is conducted in sales offices and in
nine plant locations over a six-month period. Account-
ing training calls for rotation of assignments for 18 to
24 months.
•4. Alcoa's starting salaries are competitive with those
of other companies. An initial salary is established for
a basic four-year degree. Additional credit is given for
outstanding personal qualifications, advanced educa-
tional training, military service and previous work ex-
perience. Future salary progress is based on your own

FOR
TOMORROW
doing most of the work. Prediction: Army
use in '63 with commercial application
widespread by the mid-Sixties.
Indirect Areas
Turning now from consumer applica-
tions to more indirect but equally im-
portant areas we look fiist at medicine,
which may hold the key to the future.
Indeed it is as impossible to predict what
will happen in medicine in the next dec-
ade as it was to predict the discovery of
tranquilizers in 1954 or that we would
have a polio vaccine as early as 1955.
Still we know that much time and
money is being spent in such fields as
artificial substitutes for body organs,
bones and membranes. Without a doubt
these will become more and more com-
monplace as time goes on. However, the
big hope rests on possible advances in
the treating and possible cure for heart
disease, cancer, and mental illness. Cures
or even major breakthroughs are at the
best only "long shots" but the hopes of
millions of people ride on these long
shots.
By and far the most striking and head-
line catching advances will come in the
field of space technology. As the Sput-
nik I symbolized the Fifties, a man in
space will probably symbolize the Six-
ties. Today we've just crossed the thres-
hold with an almost unlimited number of
possibilities ahead of us. At the present
it's only a matter of time before the flight
of the X-15, probes to the moon and
Mars, and operational ICBM's. All of
these things should be things of the
past by late 1961. The million-pound-
thrust rocket engine should also be a
reality by that time.
Looking further ahead the mid-Sixties
should see one of the Mercury Astronauts
go up in a satellite and return. Flyable
space ships and possible moon landings
should come in the late sixties. In addi-
tion, these advances in space technology
will make possible such things as world
wide communications systems using satel-
lite relay stations and accurate long-term
weather forecasts using TV pictures of
(Continued from page 13)
the cloud cover as seen from a satellite.
While continuing to spend enormous
amounts to help man survive in space
researchers will not neglect the survival
of the majority of us still here on earth.
For example, one research field that
seems unimportant now but may be a
lifesaver in the years to come is the
economical conversion of salt water to
a usable fluid. A recent announcement
of an 800 mile pipe line from Northern
California to the Los Angeles area drives
home the importance of this research.
Next Month
Institute of Science and Technol-
ogy—An examination of 1ST,
the rapidly growing research
arm of the University that will
serve the community, state and
nation.
Kiwi A—The world's first nuclear
rocket engine, the Kiwi A, is
a prototype of the rocket en-
gine that will lift 100,000
pounds payloads into space.
Gyroscopes—They form the basis
for the complex gryrocompass-
es that guide the atomic subs
under the polar ice and moon
rockets into outer space.
Fall of Parity — Physicists were
shocked when the parity prin-
ciple, one of their foundation
stones for years, was disproved.
Already Congress has authorized the De-
partment of Interior to spend ten million
dollars on five experimental conversion
plants—probably using a plastic mem-
brane that will let water pass through but
not the salt.
Nuclear Energy
Less likely to produce results in the
Sixties are the attempts to build com-
mercially competitive nuclear power
plants—a step that will eliminate wor-
ries of running out of conventional fuels.
Now or in the near future a half-dozen
or so nuclear plants such as those at
Shippingport, West Virginia and Monroe,
Michigan (see page 50 for an article on
this reactor) will be in operation. These
plants probably will never be commer-
cially competitive, however. Those to fol-
low these prototypes may possibly attain
this goal in the late Sixties.
The big dream in this area is the har-
nessing of fusion or thermonuclear en-
ergy for practical use. Much work is be-
ing done in this area but the enormous
problems to be met make it a "very long
shot." Along this line Dr. Edward Tel-
ler, father of the H-bomb, has suggested
the use of an underground nuclear explo-
sion to trap the heat and convert it to
usable power. Going further he points
out the possible use of these bombs in
blasting new harbors or shaking oil loose
from shale. However, a great deal of
work in "cleaning up" these bombs re-
mains before such common uses of nu-
clear power will be practicable.
Two types of materials that are quite
common in our daily lives—metals and
plastics—are wide open for big advances
although none can be predicted. The rea-
son the big opportunity exists is that de-
velopment in many field is being held
back due to the lack of suitable materials,
particularly metals. Each year the alloys
get a little stronger or a little more heat
resistant, etc. but no big advances have
been made in recent years. In the words
of Fortune magazine, "The problem in
metallurgy is easy to state: there has as
yet been no major breakthrough in metals
comparable to the transistor in electron-
ics, mylar in high polymers, or nuclear
fission in energy creation."
The work in plastics has been going
along more rapidly than in metals and
the early Sixties should find the tough
linear polyethylenes and polypropylenes
reaching large volume production and
start replacing metals in many jobs.
Basic Particles
Advancement in metals may be speed-
ed considerably by a better understanding
of basic particles and atomic structure.

Purity Plus — Hughes Products Division engineer checks
semiconductor materials to insure purity.

Exit cones capable of withstanding temperatures of 6000° F.
represent one example of advanced engineering being performed
by the Hughes Plastics Laboratory.
an atomic clock in orbit
To test Einstein's general theory of relativity, scien-
tists at the Hughes research laboratories are devel-
oping a thirty pound atomic maser clock (see photo
at lejt) under contract to the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. Orbiting in a satellite,
a maser clock would be compared with another
on the ground to check Einstein's proposition that
time flows faster as gravitational pull decreases.
Working from the new research center in Malibu,
California, Hughes engineers will develop a MASER
(Microwave Amplification through Stimulated
Emission of Radiation) clock so accurate that it
will neither gain nor lose a single second in 1000
years. This clock, one of three types contracted
for by NASA, will measure time directly from the
vibrations of the atoms in ammonia molecules.
Before launching, an atomic clock will be syn-
chronized with another on the ground. Each
clock would generate a highly stable current with
a frequency of billions of cycles per second. Elec-
tronic circuitry would reduce the rapid oscillations
to a slower rate in order to make precise laboratory
measurements. The time "ticks" from the orbiting
clock would then be transmitted by radio to com-
pare with the time of the clock on earth. By meas-
uring the difference, scientists will be able to check
Einstein's theories.
In other engineering activities at Hughes, research
and development work is being performed on such
projects as advanced airborne systems, advanced
data handling and display systems, global and spa-
tial communications systems, nuclear electronics,
advanced radar systems, infrared devices, ballistic
missile systems...just to name a few.
The rapid growth of Hughes reflects the continuous
advance in Hughes capabilities—providing an ideal
environment for the engineer or physicist, whatever
his field of interest.

This diagram shows a cross-section of the drilling apparatus used to investigate
the Mohole. Operations are carried out aboard the Cuss I, ocean oil-drilling
barge.
San Juan, Puerto Rico where the water
is 14,000 feet deep and Moho is down
another 18,000 feet. Another point is
near the Equator due south of San Diego.
The "how" will most likely be ac-
complished with slightly modified off-
shore oil exploration equipment. In par-
ticular the Moholemen have their eye on
a 3000 ton barge with a 98 foot derrick
called the Cuss I, which is named for
the Continental, Union, Shell, and Su-
perior oil companies that built and used
it in early off-shore exlorations.
The exact procedure should be essen-
tially the following: The barge is anch-
ored from six points at the specified
location. Already suspended below the
barge (but above the ocean floor) is a
prefabricated landing base.
The next step is to lower the drill
pipe through the landing base (still sus-
pended) and then drill a hole several
hundred feet deep using sea water as a
drilling fluid.
Then using the drill pipe as a guide,
the landing base is lowered and cemented
in place on the ocean floor at the top
of the hole. Next a drill casing (or riser-
piper as it is known) which rises a
short distance above the sea bottom is
guided down by special guide cables and
floatation tanks and connected to the
landing base.
Finally a flexible pipe from the riser
to the barge permits the drilling mud
to be circulated and drilling to proceed
in a fairly conventional manner.
This explanation makes the operation
sound relatively simple. Actually this is
not the case and numerous problems and
difficulties are expected. For example all
pipes and cables must be tapered so
their weight does not exceed their tensile
strength at the water's surface.
Other problems include finding highly
corrosion-resistant equipment, developing
good coring techniques for use at deep
depths, constructing instruments that are
small enough to be lowered down the
drill pipes, and of major importance—-
how to get all the pipes and lines down
without a hopeless snarl.
As far as the "when" is concerned,
nobody is really sure. Initially, and in
the near future, a hole will be drilled in
about 10,000 feet of water to get the
bugs out of the operation. Next a hole
in 16,000 feet will be tried in order to
get experience in deeper water and make
fairly good sedimentary studies. Finally,
sometime in the mid-Sixties, the AMSOC
dream should become a reality — a
MOHOLE will be drilled.
And there is little doubt that the hole
will become a reality for in the words
of the Moholemen," the
MOHOLE project appears to be scien-
tifically sound, technically feasible, and
economically reasonable.

Provide Engineers
Greater Opportunity for
Space-Age Advancement
Young engineers, particularly, will be interested in the new
opportunities created by Chance Vought's recent realignment
into five divisions.
Today, for every Vought engineer, there is a division to
make fullest use of his talents and to speed his personal
advancement. And, of course, he is backed by the four other
divisions whose balanced activities add security to his
company and his future.
Vought's realignment was the result of considerable study
of both company capabilities and new business opportuni-
ties. The move intensifies a diversification program which
began early in 1959. It specifically gears this progressive,
42-year-old aircraft firm for the challenges and opportunities
of the age of space.

RANGE
SYSTEMS

ASTRONAUTICS DIVISION
Vought is taking fullest advantage of its existing capabilities
and is drawing on 12 years' experience in the missile field to
obtain broader responsibilities in the race for space. Concen-
tration will be on advanced vehicles for space exploration,
and on ballistic and anti-ballistic missile systems.
Under a current contract, Vought is readying the four-stage
Scout research rocket and its launcher for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Also, Vought and
other members of the Boeing team are participating in the
development of the Dyna-Soar boost-glide vehicle in compe-
tition for an Air Force contract. In the human factors of
flight, Vought is taking the lead with its orbital flight
simulator and space-oriented Cockpit Laboratory.
AERONAUTICS DIVISION
Weapons of many types will take shape here. For example:
new generations of manned aircraft and atmospheric mis-
siles, and devices for antisubmarine warfare. Systems to
support these weapons, and subcontracting assignments are
other Aeronautics activities.
Among this division's current contracts: a Navy order for
development of an environmental protection and escape
capsule for aircraft pilots. Other work includes production
contracts for three versions of F8U Crusader aircraft, study
contracts in submarine detection and classification, and
subcontracts for military and commercial aircraft assemblies.
ELECTRONICS DIVISION
Vought electronics will be developed, manufactured and
marketed in increasing volume. Military systems under devel-
opment include antennas and related electronics, ground
support electronics and antisubmarine warfare apparatus.
RESEARCH DIVISION
In a new Research Center, scientists of this division will mine
new knowledge from many fields. Basic research is planned
into astronautics, undersea warfare, the life sciences (relat-
ing to human factors of flight), electrogravities and other
areas. As it evolves into applied research, this advanced
work will materially support other Vought divisions.
RANGE SYSTEMS DIVISION
Twelve years* experience in remote base operation qualifies
Vought for additional business in this new field. The Range
Systems team will establish and operate test ranges and test
equipment for missiles and space vehicles.
Genesys Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary company,
intensifies Vought's diversification into commercial elec-
tronics. Company emphasis is on automation, and its key
personnel are engineers experienced in the fields of
electronics, computers, magnetic memory, and associated
electro-mechanical devices.
You live at a discount in Dallas
In Texas there is no state income tax and no local or state
sales taxes. Low school and property levies add to your
savings. Home construction costs — as well as house and
apartment rentals — are below the national average. Fuel
costs are negligible, and most groceries cost less.
Dallas has grown faster since 1950 than any other U. S. city.
One reason is the city's wealth of entertainment and cultural
centers. Another reason is the attractive cost of living.

Chameleon Satellites
Space satellites may soon lay claim to
the chameleon"s valuable ability of chang-
ing its color for protection.
The idea involves the application of a
heat sensitive coating for satellite skins
to control internal temperature while the
vehicle is whirling through space.
Devised by Rudolf X. Meyer, a scien-
tist at Space Technology Laboratories,
the coating will change color thereby
controlling the heat absorption and radi-
ation qualities of the satellite. The idea
is based on the well-known phenomenon
that light colors reflect heat while dark
ones absorb it.
Meyer stated that by applying his new
coating the temperature inside the ve-
hicle's shell would automatically be kept
uniform. As the temperature of the satel-
lite increases, its skin would become light
in color, thereby allowing more heat to
be reflected into space. Should the pay-
load's internal temperature take a down-
ward turn, the skin would become dark
in color, thereby absorbing more radia-
tion.
The nuclear simulator pictured at the
right is used to duplicate and solve
problems that might arise aboard the
N. S. Savannah when it goes to sea. The
operators console in the background
duplicates every detail of the control
pannel that will be on board the Savan-
nah.
According to Meyer, the coating can
either take the form of a paint-like sub-
stance or a plastic applied in several
layers. He stated that he found about 35
substances while carrying out preliminary
research which have this "chameleon"
ability at the required temperature level.
For instance, one particular coating
changes with increasing temperature from
red to yellow. In the case of polymer
compounds, use is made of the reversible
transition from the sol state to the gel
state as the temperature increases.
While the first application of the in-
vention will go to aid the U. S. effort
in conquering space, little imagination is
needed to think of the many uses such
a substance could be put to here on earth.
Temperature control in homes, autos,
airplanes and a host of other such appli-
cations come readily to mind. It is not
too fantastic to think of treating cloth
with such a substance for far more coni-

a few of literally thousands of uses for
such a substance.
The San Francisco Giants' Candlestick
Park, when completed, will be the only
heated ball park in the world. All re-
served seat sections of the stadium wiL
be warmed by hot water circulating
through pipes under the concrete seats.
Aqua to re
A radically new design in large capacity
elevated water storage tanks for munici-
pal and industrial use has been devel-
oped by a division of Union Tank Car
Company.
Known as the Aquatore and resem-
bling a huge "doughnut in the sky"
the new tank eliminates the unsightly
struts and tie-rods required on conven-
tional tanks.
Major advantages of the Aquatore, the
largest water tower design to use only
a single supporting column, are 1) clean
distinctive appearance; 2) lower mainte-
nance costs; 3) a more constant water
pressure; and 4) no pump house needed.
Although there is no limit to the ca-
pacity in which the Aquatore can be
constructed, 3 million gallons is ordinar-
ily considered the largest practical ca-
pacity for most applications. Graver Tank
expects most of its sales to be in the
1 million to 3 million gallon capacity
range.
Dimensions for a typical Aquatore with
a capacity of 1,500,000 gallon capacity
would include a torus tank 94 feet in
diameter and 34 feet in height (head
range); and a column diameter of 46
feet at the ground narrowing to 23 feet
at the tank. The height of the central
supporting column is dependent on the
water pressure required, local terrain and

Company. Babcock &amp; Wilcox is design-
ing, building, and supplying the nuclear
propulsion system for the Savannah.
Among the trainees will be five senior
deck officers, one of whom will be
selected by the Maritime Administration
to captain the Savannah.
Arnold Viener, engineering manager
for nuclear instrumentation of the West-
inghouse power control and communica-
tions department has explained that train-
ees will operate the control console of
the simulator precisely as though they
were aboard ship, taking orders from the
"bridge" represented by the instructor's
desk.
The student operators wil start up the
nuclear power plant, stand watches, simu-
late emergency drills, and perform all
of the functions necessary to the oper-
ations of the ship's atomic engine. A
total of 54 switches will enable the in-
structor to cause "malfunctions" or mock
situations for the trainees to deal with
at the controls of the console. At the
instructor's desk are controls for a chart
recorder which transcribes data to be used
in evaluating the performance of the stu-
dent operators. When plotted on the strip
chart, variations in pressures, tempera-
tures, and other variables reveal the speed
and accuracy of the student's responses.
Pushbutton Phone
A pushbutton telephone device that
may eventually replace the rotary dial as
the link between the user and the tele-

Pushbutton calling has been made feas-

as the transistor, applied in an extensive

designed complex equipment to adapt
An experimental model of a pushbutton

most preferred by users.
central office switching to pushbutton sig-
nals. At the same time, the appearance
and operation of the pushbutton tele-
phone have, in so far as possible, been
tailored to suit people's preferences and
capabilities, as revealed in laboratory
tests.
To place a call on a pushbutton phone,
the user simply presses buttons instead
of turning a fingerwheel. As each button
is pressed, two simultaneous musical tones
are generated and transmitted to the cen-
tral office. The tones, which can be heard
on the receiver, are similar to those now
heard in some localities when long-dis-
tance calls are made.
This is, in effect, a new language,
different from the language the dial uses
in directing calls through the switching
system to their destinations.
The present switching system—which,
nationwide, comprises the world's largest
computer—docs not yet understand this
new language. But because of the greater
speed and convenience of the pushbutton
system, effort has been directed toward
making the system bi-lingual. An array
of mechanical-electronic equipment, ap-
propriately called a "translator," has been
developed for the purpose of adapting
existing central offices.
Simultaneously, research has been un-
dertaken to discover which kind of push-
button set people would like most and
could use most rapidly and accurately.
This is known as designing for the hu-
man factor—suiting the machine to the
human.
Hundreds of persons—including deli-
cately manicured women, stubby-fingered
he-man types, and nearsighted persons—
have helped engineers at the Laboratories
find out which button arrangements, size
and "feel" might be best.
The selected arrangement of ten but-
tons — one for each digit — consists of
three horizontal rows of three each, plus
the zero or "operator" button at the

How to get steel tubes to harness highest
steam pressures and temperatures
IN constructing Philadelphia Electric Company's revolu-
tionary new Eddystone power plant, engineers had to
harness the highest combination of pressure and steam
ever achieved in a central station with 5,000 psi at 1,200° F.
This called for superheater tubes (see diagram above) of a
special stronger steel never before used in steam power
plants. No one had ever succeeded in piercing this tougher
steel to make seamless steel tubing.
The problem was given to Timken Company metal-
lurgists, experts at piercing steels for 40 years. And they
turned the trick. They made the steel for the platen and
finishing super-heaters with the alloying elements in just
the right balance for perfect piercing quality. They pierced
20 miles of tubes free from both surface ana internal flaws.
Timken Company metallurgists and Timken steels have
solved all kinds of tough steel problems. They can help
you on problems you may face in industry.
And if you're interested in a career with the leader in
specialty steels . . . with the world's largest maker of

SPACE TECHNOLOGY Fellowships have been estab-
lished in recognition of the great scarcity of scientists
and engineers who have the very special qualifications
required for work in Systems Engineering, and of the
rapidly increasing national need for such individuals.
Recipients of these Fellowships will have an oppor-
tunity to pursue a broad course of graduate study in
the fundamental mathematics, physics, and engineering
required for careers in these fields, and will also have
an opportunity to associate and work with experienced
engineers and scientists.
Systems Engineering encompasses difficult advanced
design problems of the type which involve interactions,
compromises, and a high degree of optimization
between portions of complex complete systems. This
includes taking into account the characteristics of hu-
man beings who must operate and otherwise interact
with the systems.
The program for each Fellow covers approximately
a twelve-month period, part of which is spent at Space
Technology Laboratories, and the remainder at the
California Institute of Technology or the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology working toward the Doc-
tor's degree, or in post-doctoral study. Fellows in good
standing may apply for renewal of the Fellowship for a
second year.
ELIGIBILITY The general requirements for eligibility
are that the candidate be an American citizen who has
completed one or more years of graduate study in
mathematics, engineering or science before July. 1960.
The Fellowships will also be open to persons who have
already received a Doctor's degree and who wish to
undertake an additional year of study focused specifi-
cally on Systems Engineering.
AWARDS The awards for each Fellowship granted will
consist of three portions. The first will be an educa-
tional grant disbursed through the Institute attended
of not less than $2,000, with possible upward adjust-
ment for candidates with family responsibilities. The
second portion will be the salary paid to the Fellow for
summer and part-time work at Space Technology Lab-
oratories. The salary will depend upon his age and
experience and the amount of time worked, but will
normally be approximately $2,000. The third portion
will be a grant of $2,100 to the school to cover tuition
and research expenses.

jokes, and advertising.
Bob Rusnak is Editor-in-Chief for the
coming semester.
Professional Societies
The main objective of The Quarter-
deck Society is to promote an active
interest in the field of Naval Architecture
and Marine Engineering. Open to any
Naval Arch student, the Society achieves
this goal in three ways—preparation of
papers by prospective members, contact
with groups at other schools and uni-
versities, and addresses by men who are
active in the field of Naval Architecture.
Any Naval Arch student may apply
for membership in the Society. After
his application is accepted the prospec-
tive member is required to present a
technical paper on some aspect of Naval
Arch or Marine Engineering. Upon de-
livery of the paper the student is voted
to full membership.
The American Institute of Chemical
Engineers, one of the most active groups
on campus, sponsors a weekly luncheon
for the purpose of providing an informal
social professional period for the chem-
ical engineering students and faculty.
This period is designed to be something
more than the superficial and competitive
atmosphere encountered in the classroom,
with an emphasis on a worthwhile, pro-
vocative, and educational (as well as en-
tertaining) program.
At these Wednesday luncheons an av-
erage of 50 students enjoys menus that
have included at various times, hotdogs,
hamburgers, sandwiches and soup. The
programs—as varied as the menus—have
included A. S. Lohwater on "Education
in Russia," Vice-President James A. Lewis

talks and a film on rockets and space
travel, and a debate between John Stern
(UAW) and Prof. D. L. Katz (Chairman
of the Chem-Met Dept.) on the pros and
cons of unionism.
The aim of the student chapter of the
Society of Automotive Engineers is to
help prepare students for their future role
in industry. This goal is accomplished
mainly through talks by professional engi-
neers on subjects of current interest an J
problems the student will meet in in-
dustry.
Membership, which is open to all engi-
neering students, entitles the student to
attend all meetings and tours sponsored
by the parent society, and in addition he
receives a subscription to the SAE Journal.
On the local level most of the meetings
are held in conjunction with the A.S.M.E.
and are known as Mechanical Engineer-
ing Club functions.
By educating young civil engineers in
aspects of the profession not found in
the classroom, the American Society of
Civil Engineers fulfills its purpose of act-
ing as a stepping stone into the profes-
sional world.
Meeting twice a month, the program
usually consists of a talk by a prominent
person on some civil engineering topic.
The American Institute of Electrical
Engineers and the Institute of Radio
Engineers are organizations which pro-
mote programs to aid students and grad-
uates in EE in keeping abreast of the
latest developments in their profession.
The joint student branch of the AIEE-
1RE sponsors lectures by many outstand-
ing men in the field during the school
year, as well as field trips to various
industries.
Weekly student-faculty luncheons for
the EE's with technical and non-technical
films are another service of the local
student branch.
The Institute of the Aeronautical Sci-
ences is the representative society tor
engineers, scientists, designers and tech-
nical specialists in all the aspects related
to the science of flight and the design
of airborne craft. Its basic mission is to
facilitate by all available means the inter-
change of technical ideas among aero-
nautical engineers throughout the world.
As a student member, one will find
that the IAS is eager to contribute to his
professional advancement ... by pro-
moting his knowledge of aero sciences
... by encouraging professional con-
sciousness and fellowship . . . and most
of all by helping him to establish a solid
foundation upon which he will form and
build his career in the years to come.
The American Society of Tool Engi-
neers exists solely for the professional
benefit of its student members. Toward
this aim, a group of programs of tech-
nical interest are being planned for this
year.
The University Chapter of the Society
for the Advancement of Management
is dedicated to helping provide better
preparation for the positions in this field
and to assist in the transition from col-
lege to industry.

Honorary Societies
Vulcans, founded in 1904, is the sen-
ior engineering society which taps stu-
dents for outstanding achievement in ex-
tracurricular activities. Each spring the
Vulcans come forth from their den in
the Union Tower to tap worthy junior
engineers with oil and lampblack.
A service group as well as an honorary,
Vulcans regularly do charitable work in
nearby hospitals and at times provide
financial support for several student
groups. Vulcans have also set up a schol-
arship fund to aid a worthy student.
One of the highest honors an engineer-
ing student can receive is to be tapped
for Tau Beta Pi, whose members are
chosen for distinguished scholarship and
exemplary character. Beyond this, Tau
Beta Pi is also a service organization with
responsibilities to the school and the
community.
Tau Beta Pi is well known for the
high quality type of program presented
at semi-monthly meetings. Many men
from business and industry, as well as
discussions and other informative pro-
g.ams, highlight these meetings.
They also have quite an extensive so-
cial calender including two banquets, a
week end at a nearby lake, and other
social functions.
Triangles, the junior engineering hon-
orary, was founded in 1917 for the rec-
ognition of outstanding achievement in
extra-curricular activities and athletics.

and the
POWER STATE
the group and the individual, the values
which society places on the actions of the
individual.
We have tended to confuse social dis-
cipline with self-discipline. As the Chorus
told Prometheus, "Your wits do wander
. . ," tha "social power state has told,
and still tells, the individual to specialize
in a particular region of thought. In this
way the individual adds to the sum of
knowledge in his particular field; his
field or profession progresses, but it pro-
gresses within limitations. This has the
effect of keeping the individual and his
profession isolated. His calculations are
restricted in their origin and effects. Thus
it becomes difficult for these calculations
to be Promethean or long-term.
The "social power state" advocates this
specialization because of the extremely
large quantity of knowledge which must
be assimilated by the scientific individual
(Continued from page 23)
before he becomes useful as the "resource
. . . (of) technology." However, the time
required to assimilate the sum of the
knowledge in one scientific field is so
great that often the remainder of the edu-
cation must be treated scientifically. The
relation of science to its environment
(art, history, literature, philosophy, etc.)
becomes obscure. The implications and
consequences of our science are not known
unless the many non-scientific dimensions
(political, social, moral, etc.) are con-
sidered. We see why the ability of the
scientific intellect is impared.
The Embryo
If we now look back to the "embryo"
of reconciliation between Force and Reas-
on in the Soviet Union, we see that the
isolation and carefully specialized educa-
tion which the power state has given its
scientific "huntsmen" forms a real im-

In many fields of industry and technology,
progress depends in large measure on
solving increasingly complex ball bearing
problems. Bearing materials and lubricants
have yet to be perfected that can take cer-
tain temperature extremes. Higher speeds
and heavier loads pose formidable prob-
lems. So does miniaturization.
To help its research engineers probe
the unknowns in these and other areas,
The Fafnir Bearing Company maintains the
most up-to-date facilities for metallurgical
research, and bearing development and test-

pediment to Promethean foresight. The
Soviet power state, in its short-term view,
seeing the possibility of producing con-
summate scientists who would not ques-
tion the altered Marxist doctrines, nor
the consequences of their science, devel-
oped this barrier, thinking that it would
be to its own benefit. The Promethean
myth clearly demonstrates the disastrous
folly of this idea. The Soviet will learn,
as Zeus, and as all of the power states
that followed Zeus, learned, of the neces-
sity for Promethean foresight.
We too must realize the value of Pro-
methean intellect. The trend towards spe-
cialization and its effect on the Prome-
thean foresight should be carefully eval-
uated. Also, we cannot allow mass "cruci-
fixions of intellectual man" such as
occurred during the "Red Scare" of the
early 1950's. Actions such as the removal
of J. Robert Oppenheimer from the Gen-
eral Advisory Committee of the A.E.C.
caused, and will continue to cause, the
scientific intellect to avoid philosophical
problems.
The responsibility for the continued
existence of our Promethean intellect lies,
not only on the state and society, but
also on the individual. He must acquire
the basis for valid long-term calculations
so that he is able to recognize the im-
plications and social consequences of his
science. He must be able to advise those
who would now crucify him.

The young lady wheeled her car into
the service station, slammed on the
brakes, and dashed inside. In a few
minutes she came back, and said brightly:
"Boy, were my hands dirty!"
A broadway producer was seeking to
interest a dress manufacturer in backing
a show. He took him to a rehearsal.
One leggy lass after another appeared be-
fore him in scanty rehearsal costumes.
The merchant gaped intently, but all he
said was an occasional "Phooey."
The producer, annoyed, finally said,
"Here I show you some of the most
beautiful girls in the world, and all you
do is sit there and say 'Phooey'."
"I wasn't thinking of the girls," said
the merchant sadly, "I was thinking of
my wife."
I think that I shall never see.
A girl refuse a meal that's free;
A girl with hungry eyes not fixed
Upon a drink that's being mixed;
A girl who doesn't like to wear
A lot of junk to match her hair;
But are loved by guys like me
Cause darn if I will kiss a tree.
The new inmate at the "happy house"
kept claiming he was Napoleon. All rea-
soning to talk him out of his delusion
was fruitless. He still insisted that he
was the Little Emperor. In an effort to
bring him to his senses, the warden had
him put in with an incurable lunatic
who also thought that he was Napoleon,
hoping at least one of the two might
be helped. Eagerly, the next morning
the warden had the new inmate brought
to his office to find out if the therapy
had worked. "Well, Herman," asked the
warden, "do you still think you're Na-
poleon?" "No," answered Herman hap-
pily, "Josephine."

Little Jackie entered first grade, where
his teacher was a very well-proportioned
young lady who enjoyed very loose-fitting
blouses. One evening, several hours after
school was over, she was having dinner
in a restaurant when Jackie and his par-
ents came in.
"Daddy," the kid yelled, and all the
diners turned toward him, "There's Miss
Smith. You shoulda been in school to-
day. She leaned over too far, and one
of her lungs fell out."
Overheard at a sorority meeting:
"I'm getting married."
"How careless of you."
Two junior size "cats" were loitering
on a street corner, when one said to the
other:
"How old is you?"
"Ahs five," was the reply. "How old
is you?"
"Ah don't know," said the first.
"You don't know how old you is?"
"Nope."
"Does women botha' you?"
"Nope."
"Youse fo'."
The lady was stepping from the
shower and was about to reach for a
towel when she caught sight of a win-
dow washer taking in all of her charms.
She was too stunned to move, just star-
ing at the man.
"Watcha lookin' at lady," he finally
asked. "Aincha never seen a window
washer before?"

dilation of the rate at which the reaction
is proceeding inside the core. One chief
purpose of the secondary containment
vessel is to hold the liquid sodium in
case a leak should develop inside the
reactor.
When the reactor is in operation, elec-
tricity will be generated almost continu-
ously. However, refueling will be re-
quired weekly and ten to twenty hours
must be set aside for this procedure. The
fuel inside the reactor must be removed
and taken to laboratories for reconstitu-
tion. As part of their contribution to the
project, the AEC will carry on this oper-
ation. New fuel is then, of course, put
into place. Because of the radiation, spe-
cial material handling equipment is re-
quired to place the radioactive materials
in special storage containers. Mechanical
hands are used and the operations are
observed through television circuits.
Construction Under Way
Construction of the reactor plant is
well under way at the present time. The
reactor vessel has been delivered and the
cooling system is in place. Preliminary
tests are being run on these portions. Soon
these components wil be turned over to
PRDC and the testing program will con-
tinue. By late 1961, the reactor will have
been brought up gradually to design
capacity. The generating station is also
proceeding as planned; it should be op-
erational by September, I960.
Although it appears that substantial
proportions of the nation's electricity will
not be produced from nuclear fuels for
many years, it is certain that some day
this means of production will be a com-
mon one. Even today there are many
areas outside this country where nuclear
reactors are economically feasible. How-
ever, as a pioneer in nuclear engineering,
this country is responsible for these times
and places. As a step in the perfection
of nuclear power reactors, the Enrico
Fermi Reactor is being built.

I AM AN ENGINEER. In my profession I take pride, but without vain-
glory; to it I owe solemn obligations that I am eager to fulfill.
As an Engineer, I will participate in none but honest enterprise. To
him that has engaged my services, as employer or client, I will give the ut-
most of performance and fidelity.
When needed, my skill and knowledge shall be given without reser-
vation for the public good. From special capacity springs the obligation to
use it well in the service of humanity; and I accept the challenge that this
implies.
Jealous of the high repute of my calling, I will strive to protect the
interests and the good name of any engineer that I know to be deserving;
but I will not shrink, should duty dictate from disclosing the truth regard-
ing anyone that, by unscrupulous act, has shown himself worthy of the
profession.
Since the Age of Stone, human progress has been conditioned by the
genius of my profesional forbears. By them have been rendered usable to
mankind Nature's vast resources of material and energy. By them have
been visualized and turned to practical account the principles of science and
the revelations of technology. Except for this heritage of accumulated ex-
perience, my efforts would be feeble. I dedicate myself to the dissemina-
tion of engineering profession in all its arts and traditions.
To my fellows I pledge, in the same full measure I ask of them, in-
tegrity and fair dealing, tolerance, and respect, and devotion to the stan-
dards and the dignity of our profession; with the consciousness, always,
that our special expertness carries with it the obligation to serve humanity
with complete sincerity.

A RESUME IS A TWO-PARTY AFFAIR
Throughout your engineering career, the name
of the first employer appearing on your resume
can be as significant as your education. But, in
selecting that first employer, you should also
consider his resume.
ITT is the largest American-owned world-wide
electronic and telecommunication enterprise.
To give you an idea of the breadth of our
activity . . . there are 80 research and manu-
facturing units and 14 operating companies in
the ITT System playing a vital role in projects
of great national significance in electronics
and telecommunications research, development,
production, service and operation.
The scope and volume of work entrusted to us
by industry and the government opens a broad
range of highly diversified engineering and
technical positions in all areas of our work ...
from tiny diodes to complex digital computer
systems and a massive network of global
communications.
In addition to the opportunities for work and
association with distinguished engineers and
scientists, our graduate education tuition re-
fund program encourages engineers to continue
their formal training . . . and the facilities

The summer suntans are fading, and
going to class is again becoming par-
tially automatic. Now that your minds are
nimble from a month's "study", see
what you can do with the Teasers. The
first one involves a carpenter who doesn't
belong to a union, and the last is a little
square. When the professor leaves the
room, turn the page and work as fast as
you can.
(1). A carpenter agrees to work under
the following conditions: He is to be
paid at the rate of $5.50 a day for his
work, while he must pay at the rate of
$6.60 a day for lost time. At the end of
30 days he has paid out as much as he
received. How many days did he work?
(2). From among 36 guilty persons
there were 6 whom an ancient judge
wished to punish. He wanted to free to be without solution: Divide a square
the rest if it could be done with an into a number of smaller squares, no
appearance of impartiality. He arranged two of them equivalent.
all 36 in a circle and punished every (Teasers answers on page 56)
tenth. In what place did he put the 6
victims?
(3). What is the least number of
standard weights needed to weigh every
whole number of pounds from 1 to 40?
(It is understood that the weighing ma-
chine is the simple equal-arm balance.)
(4). A boatman must carry a wolf, a
goat, and a cabbage across a river in a
boat so small that he can take only one
at a time. Furthermore, he must be on
hand to keep the wolf from the goat, and
the goat from the cabbage. How shall
he do it?
(5). Here is a problem long thought
TECHNOLOGY
This understanding may get a big boost
in I960 when 25-bev accelerators at
Brookhaven National Laboratory and at
Geneva, Switzerland take over the work
of the 2.5 bev Brookhaven Cosmotron
and the 6 bev Berkley Bevatron. These
new machines should provide a clearer
image and understanding of the elemen-
tary particles. Although a comprehensive
theory of elementary particles—similar
to the Quantum Theory of the Twenties
—may still be in the future in 1969,
man's concept of the sub-nuclear universe
should be greatly clarified and/or
changed.
Going to an opposite extreme—the
real universe—we find that man may
soon have a much better and clearer un-

derstanding of astrophysical theory. This
will come about due to larger and better
radio telescopes which are being devel-
oped rapidly.
Finally, one last area that should be
mentioned is electronics and computers.
The Fifties saw rapid growth in this
field with the development of the tran-
sistor in 1951, of masers in 1954 (Tech.
nic, May 1959), the widespread devel-
opment of electronic gear for missies,
and the building of bigger and bigger
computers. The Sixties will see this
growth continued and by the late Sixties
we should have super computers with
near-brainlike attributes.
In the preceding paragraphs an at-
tempt has been made to preview some
of the developments of the Sixties. Many
others are listed on the chart on page
20. Still others, as the experience with
the Fifties shows, are totally unpredict-
able. Yet there has been enough indica-
tion to show the tremendous expansion
of technology to come. However, no one
can say what limits will be reached.
This same thought was expressed by
N. N. Semenov, the 1956 Nobel prize
winner in chemistry, when he said, "It
is hard to imagine at what breathtaking
speed the capacity of man to master the
forces of nature may advance in the
future." But regardless of the speed
there is no doubt that the Sixties will
indeed be the Years of Decision.

Mechanical Engineering
Mechanical Engineering is essential to virtually every industry and to every phase of technology. As
a result, it offers the widest range of opportunity and endeavor available in engineering today. In turn, this
requires that the mechanical engineer receive a broad and basic education which provides him with a
depth and breadth of understanding of the basic fundamentals—a background that characterizes mechan-
ical engineers and explains their ability to perform in all of the fields of engineering.
It is because of his wealth of technical background that a mechanical engineer finds such a wide
range of opportunities available. His education includes basic science and mathematics courses, non-tech-
nial courses, as well as a number of courses which my be termed engineering science.
Mechanical engineering courses at Michigan are directly supported by a number of laboratories in
which the student gains not only a background in particular areas, but also a general knowledge of
the scientific approach to engineering problems and the use of essential mechanical and scientific equip-
ment.
While the mechanical engineering curriculum, of necessity, must be broad and inclusive, there is
sufficient flexibility, even at the undergraduate level, to permit course work in particular areas of interest,
such as the automotive field, internal combustion engines, heat and power, metal cutting and manufactur-
ing, product design, and materials.

Under llCj the performance of men and machines depends on what they are made of. United States Steel
makes the materials for the machines, whether it's a very tough armor plate, or heat-resistant alloy, or Stainless Steels.
You might be interested in some of the USS steels developed specifically for aircraft and missiles:
USS Strux, an alloy steel with close to 300,000 psi tensile strength primarily for aircraft landing gears;
USS Airsteel X-200, an air-hardenable alloy steel with 230,000 psi yield strength for aircraft sheet and missile
applications; USS 12MoV and USS 17-5 MnV Stainless Steels for high-speed aircraft and missiles;
Stainless "W", a precipitation-hardenable Stainless Steel.
New "exotic" metals, new methods for making them, present an exciting challenge. Men willing to accept this
challenge—civil, industrial, mechanical, metallurgical, ceramic, electrical or chemical engineers have a future
with United States Steel. Write to: United States Steel, Personnel Division, Room 2316,

ATOMIC POWER and DETROIT EDISON
A vast new source of energy—from the atom—is
of major interest at Detroit Edison. The advances
already made indicate that the electric power
industry is on the threshold of exciting new
developments in atomic electric power.
Detroit Edison personnel are playing a leading
role in these developments. One such project is
the Enrico Fermi Atomic Power Plant near
Monroe, Michigan. Here many of our men are
assigned to the Power Reactor Development
Company and the Atomic Power Development
Associates in the design and construction of the
world's largest breeder reactor. This is but one
example of many scientific pioneering achieve-
ments which provide continuing challenges to
young engineers in the electric power industry.

Reversal
During a recent convention at Pennsylvania State
College, the editors of the Technic happened into a
conversation with the editors of the City College of
New York Vector (an engineering college maga-
zine.) The subject of discussion covered a vast area
which included shop talk, curriculum, future jobs,
and eventually pin pointed on the attitude of the
student body toward the Engineers. Being aware of
the presence of a negative attitude here on campus
(in the respect that Engineers are looked down
upon), we were completely taken by surprise to dis-
cover that our situation was not prevalent on their
campus, but to a good degree quite the opposite.
"Why should the Engineer be looked up to?" this
question stirred over and over in our minds. To be
quite frank, we know the answer and have known
it for quite some time but the thought never occurred
that we should cite it to motivate our cause and
advance our profession.
The Engineering student is entering into a pro-
fession as diverse in occupational fields as the uni-
verse is huge. This fact alone indicates that the
Engineer must possess the qualities of intelligence,
originality, abstractness, self-discipline, and fear-
lessness of the unknown. Many hours of vigorous
studying fill his typical day as the Engineer prepares
in the basic foundation of his field. This huge study
load steals the Student Engineer away from many
pleasurable hours of leisure; but without this self-
sacrifice, he would never be able to contribute to the
profession that is mainly responsible for our high
standard of living and our rapid economic advance-
ment over the past century. But yet, there are those
who would criticize.
Present in this great university is a pronounced
negative attitude toward Engineering that reflects
the ignorance of those who bear it. The Engineer-
ing student's chief critic does not lie within himself,
as it should, but in the student body as a whole.
This is of course due to the fact that the engineers
are an almost separate body and easily sterotyped.
As in the game of chess, the defensive player is
seldom the victor; I therefore shall not attempt to
defend the biased criticisms that indiscretely pop up,
but rather discuss the merits of the Engineer.
The Engineer possesses individuality and he must,
for problems occur every day that necessitate his
unique solution. However, individuality is not con-
tained only in his work, but in just about everything
the engineer is concerned with, his dress, his per-
sonality, his car, the books he reads, the friends he
chooses, etc. This individuality is not the so-called
"Mass Individuality" that is so prevalent on campus.
I mean that individuality which is possessed by those
persons who would never dream of being considered
anything near common nor would they ever be with-
out their Harvard Green Book Bag, their trench
coats and sneakers, their unopened book of poetry,
and their cramped-up foreign auto.
The Engineer is a master of the art of common
sense. "Common Sense" has been sneaking around
since the age of man to occassionally stand out in
the men who are extremely observant and crafty.
Now, "Common Sense" has out done himself; it
seems that he has sired a whole breed of men and
those be the Engineers. These endowed individuals
show common sense in most every respect. That little
extra ability in economics, scientific matters, mechan-
ical, social, etc. puts their university rivals to shame.
A good example of the Engineers common sense is
displayed in his dress. Being that there is a lack of
femininity around engine school (females being
the only reason that Lit. students try to dress sharp),
and with nobody left to impress but Profs., the
Engineer uses good economic sense in wearing
easily launderable clothes. Also engine labs are not
noted for their absolute sterile conditions.
In discussing the Student Engineer, one must not
loose sight of his career. Engineering is still young
and striving for that professionalism already attained
by our doctors and lawyers. A young man is wise to
enter Engineering. The field is growing; the future
looks bright; the demand is high; and the security
is plentiful. Wise is he to have made that decision
rather than waste his time in the social schools being
capable, on graduation, only of knowing the differ-
ence between the Kingston Trio and Mozart with a
mastery of the cork screw sandwiched between.
These are but a few of the more obvious reasons
why Engineers should be held in esteem. So Gentle-
men, take stock of yourselves—what you do, what
you are capable of, and what you do not do, and by
all means do not sell yourself short.

The Mathematics Department helps you to use
high-speed computers to solve your problem
The Mathematics Department helps Westinghouse
engineers take advantage of modern methods of mathe-
matics and new developments in this field. If new tech-
niques are needed to use a digital computer for solving
an engineer's problem, these men will develop them.
This department, the second of its kind in American
industry, is staffed by 15 Ph.D.'s, 3 M.S.'s, and 6 B.S.
mathematicians. Among other accomplishments, it is
credited with developing OPCON, an electronic brain
for optimizing control of processing systems. OPCON
won for Westinghouse the 1958 Industrial Science
Achievement Award of the A.A.A.S.
Supporting the work of about 150 other mathemati-
cians with operating divisions, the Mathematics Dept.
is actively studying industrial logistics (called OR or
Operations Research by some), fatigue of metals (pio-
neering work using statistical techniques), equipment
and system design, and a variety of other challenging
problems.
The young engineer at Westinghouse isn't expected to
know all of the answers. Our work is often too advanced
for that. Each man's work is backed up by specialists—
like the men in this Mathematics Dept. Even tough
problems are easier to solve with this kind of help.
If you've ambition and real ability, you can have a
rewarding career with Westinghouse. Our broad product
line, decentralized operations, and diversified technical
assistance provide hundreds of challenging opportuni-
ties for talented engineers.

more good jobs at Du Pont

HOW LONG WILL IT STAY BRIGHT AND SHINY?
That depends, for the most part, on its
finish. The most dazzling cars on the road
today wear gleaming coats of Du Pont
■'Lucite"* acrylic lacquer. For "Lucite"
stays bright and beautiful three times longer
than the best conventional finishes.
Like hundreds of other products de-
veloped through Du Pont research, "Lucite"
has created all kinds of new jobs. Jobs in
the laboratory. Jobs in production. And
jobs in sales and marketing. Good jobs
that have contributed substantially to the
growth of Du Pont and the prosperity of
our country.
It's an old story. But it's truer today
than ever. For the very nature of our busi-
ness makes research pay off, giving us the
courage to "obsolete" products when better
ones are found. This is probably why our
sales have increased more than tenfold dur-
ing the last twenty-five years. And for every
dollar we have spent on research during
these years, we have been able to invest
three in new production facilities.
What does all this have to do with you?

For qualified bachelors, masters, doctors,
career opportunities are greater today at
Du Pont than ever before. There is an in-
teresting Du Pont future for metallurgists,
physicists, mathematicians, electrical and
mechanical engineers, and other technical
specialists, as well as for chemists and chem-
ical engineers.
You probably won't discover a "Lucite,"

NUCLEAR
ROCKET
ENGINE
With the hope of lifting 50-ton payloads into
outer space in the near future, scientists are
now turning to nuclear power as the best
method available.
by BARRY E. PEEBLES, '60E
A Kiwi-A experimental nuclear
reactor like the one pictured here
went into operation recently. The
reactor is designed to determine
whether atomic energy can thrust
a rocket into outer space. The
railroad car can be controlled re-
motely.
(World Wide Photos, Inc.)
THE TIME: Early July, 1959. THE
PLACE: Jackass Flat, Nevada. THE
OBJECT: A large tuba-appearing ap-
paratus known as Kiwi A. THE MIS-
SION: Test firing of the world's first
nuclear rocket engine.
This was the setting on a deserted
desert plain as a remote-controlled
locomotive slowly maneuvered into posi-
tion the Kiwi A — a two story high
maze of pipes, wires, and metal mounted
on a special railroad car chassis. Then
with the locomotive at a safe distance,
scientists two miles away in a concrete
blockhouse made final hurried checks
before pushing the button to activate the
uranium bearing fuel plates and the
pressurized liquid hydrogen.
Minutes later the results were known.
Although the Kiwi A, like the legendary
flightless Kiwi bird of New Zealand,
was not meant to rise even an inch off
the ground the mission was hailed as an
unqualified success. To the men from the
sponsoring Atomic Energy Commission
and the scientists of the Los Alamos
research team, who developed the Kiwi
as part of the overall Project Rover, there
was no doubt about it: nuclear powered
space ships will and must replace today's
chemical combustion rockets if big pay-
loads are to be put into outer space.
Closer Look
At first this statement might be passed
off as remarks by slap-happy scientists
gleeful over the success of their project.
However, a closer look behind this state-
ment shows that the chemical rockets,
powerful as they are, will soon reach
the limit of their development, which
falls short of what will be needed to lift
100,000 pound payloads into outer space.
For this reason it might be well, before
looking closer at the Kiwi A and its own
problems, to examine the limitations that
face today's rocket engine designers.
First of all, it should be pointed out
that a rocket, whether nuclear or chem-
ical, is nothing more than a heat engine
which uses a special nozzle to convert
the heat energy to kinetic propulsion
energy. This conversion is accomplished
as hot gas escapes through the nozzle
and expands very rapidly. This expansion
causes the velocity of the gas to be in-
creased tremendously. It follows naturally
that as the velocity of the gas increases
the performance of the rocket does like-
wise.
From tests and studies made in recent
years scientists have determined that
there are only two basic factors that affect
the gas velocity (and therefore the rock-
ets performance). These factors are the

molecular weight of the gas. The space-
men know that as the temperature goes
up and the molecular weight goes down
the gas velocity increases.
Chemical Rockets
This point leads us to the chemical
combustion rockets used in today's mis-
siles. The rocket engines for such mis-
siles as the Atlas and Jupiter are oper-
ating in the 5000°F range, which is
approaching the highest temperature ob-
tainable by combustion. On the other
hand, the fuels for these missiles usually
have a molecular weight of 19—with
the lowest level possible without lower-
ing the combustion temperature is nine.
When an optimum point of these two
factors—molecular weight and combus-
tion temperature — is reached the gas
velocity will be about 13,000 ft/sec.
Of course, larger and larger engines
can be built. In fact, a rocket with a
million pound thrust is being developed
now. But with the enormous amount of
space needed for fuel storage there is
considerable doubt whether or not the
payload would even come close to that
of a nuclear rocket of the same or smaller
size.

is a weight comparison of the possible
rocket types needed to lift a 100,000
pound payload into outer space. The

rocket—which probably will be more
reliable than a combination nuclear-
chemical rocket since no stage separa-
tion is necessary. The main drawback to
chemical rockets is shown in the last
illustrations—namely they must be al-
most 5 times as heavy as a nuclear
rocket to lift the same payload.

«?-^

Nuclear Rocket Engine
With these facts in mind let's turn
now to the nuclear rocket engine—how
it operates, its advantages over a chem-
ical combustion engine, and some of the
problems that must be conquered.
15
mi f lion
lbs.

This rocket is the largest needed to
carry a 100,000 pound payload and is
of the four stage, solid propellant type.
Because of its weight (165 million lbs.),
it is the least efficient type for space
travel.
The Kiwi A
Basically, the Kiwi A, and its sister
engines to follow, work like this: Hydro-
gen is stored in liquid form at 820°F.
From the tanks it is forced under high
pressure (1000 lbs./sq. in.) between a
large number of reactor fuel plates which
are impregnated with uranium. In this
reactor the gas is heated as high as the
reactor can stand and then ejected.
Almost immediately we can see one
of the major advantages of this system—
namely that the gas used in hydrogen
which has a molecular weight of one
(the lower the M.W. the higher the
velocity). This alone means that a re-
actor operating at 4000°F can expel
gases at 25,000 ft/sec or nearly twice as
fast as the optimum chemical combustion
rocket.
In addition the nuclear reactor can
furnish heat at almost unlimited tempera-
tures if materials are developed to go
with it. What's more, there is no need
to worry about having exact fuel com-
positions because, in the words of the
Kiwimen, hydrogen or helium will work
perfectly "without regard to chemical
combustion characteristics." The possibil-
ities leave one almost breathless.
Although the Kiwi A test was un-
doubtedly a success there are a number
of problems to be surmounted before a
nuclear-powered rocket leaves the earth.
The principal one is the control of the
flow of hydrogen so it exactly balances
the production of energy by the reactor.
If the flow should be too slow the engine
might melt in seconds. On the other
hand, if it is too great the engine could
be blown to bits. However, the Kiwi
success seems to indicate that this prob-
lem has been licked.
Temperatures
The mentioned operating temperature
of 4000°F actually turns out to be some-
what of a barrier even though it is 1000
degrees lower than that used in today's
rockets. The difference is that in chem-
ical combustion engines most of the heat
is confined to the gas and the shell is
Igggfe^-
kept cool by in-flowing gas which acts
as a heat exchanger. However, in the
nuclear reactor engine heat is generated
in the core by the "fissioning of the
uranium incorporated into its fuel plates."
This means that for a 4000 °F gas the
core will be about 4800 °F.
Immediately the problem of materials
becomes paramount. From a limited choice
of materials graphite seems to be the
best pick. Graphite retains its strength at
4800 °F, but this strength is low and it
is subject to rapid erosion. It may be
sufficient, however, to last the one or
two minutes before the payload is free
of the earth's gravity.
The scientists have also encountered a
major problem in the design of the re-
actor. They would like to have just as
many fuel plates as possible because as
the number goes up it reduces the
amount of heat that must pass through
a given area in a given time.
But this improvement creates another
problem—namely the greater surface area
causes a greater drop in pressure and at
the same time increases the drag on the
reactor. For example with 1000 pounds
of gas and a 10,000 pound core there
may be as much as 300,000 pounds drag
on the reactor. Making it worse, the
rocket will probably undergo an acceler-
ation of 10 g, or in other words a
10,000 pound engine will "weigh" 100,-
000 pounds. These two factors mean a
400,000 pound force on the structure.
While withstanding this load the struc-
ture must still be light, take a very small
space, and be able to stand high temper-
atures.
It is now obvious from the above
discussion that many and varied prob-
lems exist in the design and construction
of a nuclear-powered rocket engine. The
Kiwi A test indicates, however, that we
have already conquered partially or com-
pletely a great many of the problems
involved, although the AEC refuses to
indicate to what extent. The one fact
that remains is that a nuclear engine is
possible and necessary if 50 ton payloads
are to be lifted into outer space.

From Toy To
Guidance System
Hollywood couldn't have written a better suc-
cess story for the tiny gyros — they have pro-
gressed from a mere child's toy to an important
element in the guidance system of today's mis-
siles, planes, and nuclear subs.
by JOHN MARSHALL, '62E
Just a few miles from St. Petersburg,
Florida, lies a plain white concrete
building that looks like a small factory.
From afar the building and grounds
surrounding it give the impression of
normalcy but a venture up close reveals
a moat and an armed guard. As would
be expected the guard and the moat are
there to protect, but the moat, unlike
the guard who protects against "animal"
intruders, protects against an unseen but
nevertheless present interloper, vibration.
The little white building is actually a
factory which produces one of the United
States' most valuable instruments. This
instrument, which is the size of a soup
can, is the hermetic integrating gyro-
scope, usually called Mr. HIG. Without
Mr. HIG our Atlases, Jupiters, Thors,
Nautiluses, Skates, etc., would be a pile
of junk. Mr. HIG guides all the missiles
and submarines of today and will be the
super-brain of tomorrow.
Most people today know little about
the gyroscope (gyro for short), and even
then this knowledge is limited to the
toy they had when they were young.
What they tend to remember most, how-
ever, was the ability of the toy gyro to
remain in almost any position, as long
as its center wheel remained spinning.
Unfortunately, the wheel always slowed
down and stopped within a short time
due to the gyro's major enemy, friction.
Friction!!
For many generations scientists tried
in vain to create a gyro that was virtually
frictionproof. They failed basically be-
cause they didn't understand many under-
lying principles of gyroscopic action and
because tolerances and instruments were
of a lower caliber than those of today.
The major breakthrough came during or
shortly after the Korean War when Dr.
C. S. Draper of MIT developed the
"floating gyro." His gyro wheel was
about the size of four fifty-cent pieces
placed on top of each other and it spun
in helium at 24,000 revolutions per min-
ute in a container the size of a large egg.
This container in turn floated in another
container filled with a heavy molasses
like fluid. Thus the gyro was virtually
weightless and friction was at a minimum.
This is Mr. HIG.
Right after Mr. HIG was developed,
the Department of Defense turned him
over to Minneapolis-Honeywell, a lead-

John Marshall, a sophomore in
C-M, is a recent addition to the
Technic staff. John is a graduate of
an undisclosed Detroit High School
where he participated in activities
too numerous to mention.
Here at Michigan John has con-
centrated on studies mainly, but we
are sure he has been diverted on
occasion for side trips to the Hill.
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


solving many basic difficulties, Minneap-
olis-Honeywell built the small white fac-
tor)' near St. Petersburg. Since a gyro is
extremely vibration-sensitive, all vibra-
tions had to be eliminated from the
production room. Wet ground conducts
vibrations and a truck or train rumbling
by or the pounding of waves in the Gulf
of Mexico some ten miles away could
have caused chaos. M-H solved this vi-
bration problem by building the factory
on ponderous piles and then digging a
moat which would drain away every
possible drop of water. The insides of
the factory are truly astounding. The
production rooms are kept at "positive
pressure." This means that air pressure
outside is lower than inside so that stray
dust particles tend to be blown from the
room. The rooms are probably the most
perfectly air conditioned rooms in the
world. The men who work on the pro-
duction line, all master watchmakers,
have to wear sterilized garments just like
those of surgeons. No one may smoke
or even use a pencil or eraser. No gauze
masks are worn on the production line
but instead, the supersensitive gyros are
protected from human breath moisture by
glass shields.
Once assembled, Mr. HIG must pass
certain tests. One is to detect movements
3,000 times slower than the motion of
the hour hand of a watch. A second is
to develop no more friction than the
amount needed to stop a boy on a sled
coasting down a slope which drops one
foot in every 1,000 miles, and a third
is to be able to detect the slightest angles
of deviation from its course.
Principles Involved
As mentioned before, not too many
people know or understood the princi-
ples underlying gyroscopic action. So
that those who want to know more about
gyros won't have to go to the library
and find that the author has all the books
out, the basic ideas of the gyro are dis-
cussed in the next few paragraphs!
Gyro Properties
Any spinning mass exhibits certain
traits known as gyroscopic characteristics.
By definition, when such a spinning mass
is designed and mounted in a manner
making these characteristics usable, the
device is called a gyroscope.
The gyro's spinning mass is normally
referred to as the rotor or the wheel or
gyro element. The "bracket" holding the
rotor shaft is known as a gimbal. Normal-

missle firing submarine's navigation center. Sperry specialists are shown check-
ing intricate equipment and gyros.
ly this gimbal will be a complete ring
or something approaching a sphere.
Remember the "gyroscopes" mentioned
earlier in the paper that you knew as a
child . . . the dime (dollar) store
variety? Like most everyone else, you
were probably fascinated by the perform-
ance of one of these gadgets. Pulling a
string wound around its rotor shaft set
it spinning, and while spinning, it
seemed to defy the law of gravity as
though it had a mind of its own. For
instance, when placed on the edge of a
glass with its rotor spinning around a
horizontal axis it would remain there as
though something were holding it up.
If the glass were tilted slightly, it would
move slowly around the edge of the glass
with its rotor shaft remaining horizontal
rather than following the tilt of the glass
as one might consider normal. In this
action that simple device exhibited the
two primary phenomena of a gyro:
1. It has stability of its own in space.
2. When something tries to move it,
it resists, but moves instead around an
axis 90° to the appplied force. This
movement is called precession.
Stability in Space
Stability in space is readily explained
by Newton's first Law of Motion. This
basic law of physics states in part, "a
body in motion remains in uniform mo-
tion in a straight line, unless acted upon
by an unbalanced external force." For
example, if a disc rolled along a flat
surface, it will continue to roll in a
straight line until it loses speed. Inertia

OF
PARITY
After years of use the world over, one of the
fundamental laws of physics has been dis-
proved.
by IRVING SALMEEN, '63E
It isn't very often that an event occurs
in the field of science that upsets the
very foundation upon which the laws
of science are based. But this is exactly
what has happened in the field of phys-
ics. A basic law—known as the parity that much of physics will have to be

conservation of energy and matter, means
Irving Salmeen, a graduate of
the Iron Mountain Senior High
School, was a member of the Key
Club, Debate Team, and the bas-
ketball Team. Irving's interest in
writing originates from high school
where he was on the Year Book
staff and school paper.
During his spare time in college
Irving follows his interest in Pho-
tography, Hi-Fi, and Modern Art.

The principle of parity can be stated
in the following manner: any process
which occurs in nature also occurs as it
is seen in a mirror. In other words,
nature is mirror symmetric; there is no
distinction made between right and left.
According to this law, any motion, action,
or event which can be observed in a
mirror also occurs in nature. To put it
more concisely, the laws of nature are
invariant under reflection.
Math Concept
Strictly speaking, parity is a mathe-
matical concept, very difficult to put into
physical terms, which defines certain
characteristics of the so-called wave func-
tions of quantum physics. It describes
the wave characteristics and represents
their position in space. The variables of
the function are those coordinates that
are used to locate spacial positions. If
the sign of one of the coordinates is
changed from say a plus to a minus, this

it appears as a reflection of the system
in a mirror. If the wave function remains
unchanged when the sign of one of its
coordinates is changed then it is said that
the wave has "even" parity. If the wave
function is changed, then the wave has
"odd" parity. Thus, parity has two val-
ues, odd or even. In an isolated system
this parity is constant, it never changes.
To put it another way, we say that parity
is conserved.
In an article of this nature it is im-
possible to explain the mathematical prin-
ciples and terms of parity; however, we
can explain the concept of right-left
mirror symmetry. As an example let us
take a perfectly-balanced uniform bar
supported in the exact center by a pivot.
(See figure 1.) We know that under
these conditions this bar will not tip but
let us prove it using mirror symmetry
or the parity principle. This bar can do
one of three things: 1. it can tip counter-
clockwise, 2. it can tip clockwise, 3. it
will remain in balance and not tip at all.
(See figure 2.). If the bar moves as in
statement one, the mirror image will
have motion "a". To obey parity the
mirror image must have the same motion
as the real object. We can see in the
diagram that the image motion is not the
same, thus statement one violates parity
and cannot be the correct motion. The
same reason applies to statement two.
Only the conditions of statement three
make it possible for the mirror image and
the real object to be identical. Therefore,
by the parity principle only statement
three is correct.
Another example is an object with
spirality. In such an object the direction
of motion is associated with a sense of

rotation. In a mirror the image has op-
posite spirality; hence, by the parity
principle it must exist in nature. We
know from experience that both types
of spirals do exist. To illustrate this, look
at figure 3- The mirror can be placed in
one of two positions, horizontal or verti-
cal. When the mirror is in the horizontal
position the sense of direction of the
spiral is changed and the sense of rota-
tion is unchanged. In the other position
the opposite is true, the rotation is
changed and the direction is unchanged.
Since both conditions exist, parity is
conserved.
One more example to illustrate parity
is the case of the crystal molecule; the
tetrahedral molecule in particular. (Figure
4.) No matter how the molecule is
rotated, the mirror image cannot be made
to look like the original. Therefore, both
molecules must exist in nature. Indeed,
we find this to be true in the quartz
crystal. Both molecular configurations are
found in a sample of quartz. There are
no differences in physical properties of
the two crystals, they are identical.
Weak Interactions
Until the recent startling events it ap-
peared that the indescernability between
an object and its mirror image was un-
contestable. All previous experience had
shown that there was no distinction be-
tween the looking glass world and the
real world. But certain baffling events
which occurred duing the newly dis-
covered "weak interactions" caused Tsung
Dao Lee of Columbia and Chen Ning
Yang of the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton to suggest that on the scale
of weak interactions, parity was not con-
served. Like other physicists, Lee and
Yang had been puzzling about the be-
havior of two recently discovered parti-
cles. These were the tau and theta mesons,
members of a group of particles known
as K particles. Tau and theta particles
are formed in certain nuclear collisions
and in a time of about 10'8 seconds
they decay. The tau disintegrates into
three pi mesons and the theta into two
pi mesons. The baffling part of this was
that in every property except the mode
of decay these two particles were ab-
solutely identical. Was it possible that
these two particles were one and the
same? Other particles were known to
have different modes of decay. However,
in the case of these particles the con-
servation of parity stood in the way. The
tau meson decayed into a pair of pi
mesons with "odd parity" while the
theta decayed into three pi mesons with
"even parity". The conservation of parity
said that the tau and the theta must be
different particles since they had different
parity. In other words, the mirror images

MICHIGAN
As computers and computing continue to have
increased importance on our lives the Techn/c
surveys the computer situation at Michigan.
by CARL PAGE, '60E
In the past decade, computers have
made a spectacular impact upon the
processes of applied mathematics in sci-
ence, engineering, and business. If the
education of the prospective leaders in
the fields of science, engineering, and
business is to keep pace with develop-
ments in the fields themselves, then it
must include some information about
computers. The University of Michigan
has responded to the challenge of com-
puter education perhaps more extensively
than any other educational institution in

the nation. No less than four depart-
ments of the Engineering College, one
of the Business Administration School
and one of the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts, are offering courses
in some phase of computers. Moreover,
the Rackham School of Graduate Studies
offers a graduate program in computer
engineering for those who wish to spe-
cialize in the design of digital computers.
However, the impact of computers up-
on the University student has been more
widespread than just a few new courses
in a catalog. The Department of Chem-
ical and Metallurgical Engineering began
a program last semester of evening lec-
tures about GAT, an algebra-like lan-
guage which can be used to communicate
with one type of computer, the IBM 650,
which was then part of the University

of Michigan Statistical Computing Lab-
oratory. Over 200 undergraduate students
in the department attended the lectures,
which were climaxed with a closed cir-
cuit TV demonstration of a rocket prob-
lem being run on the University's IBM
650. Since the GAT translator or com-
piler program system was used, it was
not necessary for the students to become
familiar with the internal command
scheme of instruction of the computer.
Other departments, such as Civil Engi-
neering, have had special lectures on the
use of computers on problems of their
area.
The Chemical and Metallurgical stu-
dents were invited to use the computer,
rather than a slide rule, for any lengthy
calculations they might encounter during
their regular class work. They were re-
quired to punch their own cards, (as all
students are) for input to the machine,
but the problems were run on the com-
puter for them by laboratory assistants.
Many of the students used the computer,
a few claiming to have solved problems
which have never been solved before. As
was stated above, they used GAT, a form
of compiler program. Before going on,
let us clarify the various approaches in
communicating with a digital computer.
We will assume in the following dis-
cussion that input to the computer is in
the form of punched cards.
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Digital computer users have three
usual ways of communicating the prob-
lem they wish to solve to the computer.
They may prepare their problem in basic
machine code, that is, in a numerical code
which is built into the machine for simple
arithmetic operations or logical oper-
ations in the machine. Usually the ma-
chine code is a number associated with
two numbers which give the location (or
address of the operand and the address
of the next instruction in the memory of
the computer. (One may think of each
cell or address in the machine as a place
to put numbers in the form of magnetic
spots.) For example, consider this in-
struction from the IBM 650:
Location on magnetic drum 1400;
operation code 60; operand 1951;
next operand 1956.
60 is the operation meaning "place a
number into the device called the upper
accumulator"; 1951 is the address of the
operand; 1956 is where the machine
should pick up the next instruction. If
the storage location 1956 on the mag-
netic drum contains the instruction:
10 1966 0014
the machine will do 10, that is, add into
the upper accumulator the number which
is stored at the location 1966, then go
on to the address 14 for the next in-
struction. Since the accumulator now con-
tains the sum of the numbers which are
in 1951 and 1966 let us store it some-
where for future references. The code for
store upper accumulator on the IBM
650 is 11, so we punch on a card to be
"read" electrically into location 14:
11 0600 0069
and the accumulator is stored in location
0600 while the machine picks up the
number in 0069 for the next instruction.
In the early days of computers, (5-10
years ago) most programming was done
in machine code. However, only a small
fraction of machine users do problems
in machine code today.
Automation Programming
One reason computers were originally
built was to take care of problems which
were long, tiresome, routine, and imbued
with trivial detail. But programming a
computor using direct machine code for
a long problem is long, tiresome, routine,
and imbued with trivial detail. So it was
not too long before computor program-
mers began to invent schemes whereby

Carl Page, author of Comput-
ing at Michigan, is a senior in the
Science Engineering program. Dur-
ing his active years at the Flint
Mandeville High School he was
class president and a member of
the Student Council. When Carl

sues his many interests, which vary

and music.
the machine might be used to assist in
the programming. Two types of schemes
are widely used today. One is an assem-
bly program method which is a symbolic
extention of machine code and is con-
sequently somewhat easier to use than
machine code. Assembly programs usually
generate one machine instruction per in-
put. The other main type of system is a
compiler program which generates several
machine codes for one input statement.
Some compilers allow input which looks
almost like algebra or a language, and
they are especially useful for problems
which evaluate many complicated formu-
las.
Let us take the simple example of
taking two numbers, adding them, and
then storing them somewhere in an as-
sembly program SOAP II and then in
GAT, a compiler, both of which are
used on the IBM 650
SOAP II, which stands for "Symbolic
Optimum Assembly Program" is a com-
puter program which accepts instruction-
like inputs. But these inputs have alpha-
betical symbols instead of numeric codes,
and symbolic addresses instead of fixed
numeric addresses. Let us consider this
illustration:
The operator handles all information
at the console. He then can translate
this to the mathematical board behind
the panel.

The symbols WORD 1, WORD 2,
SUM, FIRST, NEXT, and GO ON have
no meaning except to specify a location
in the machine. Everywhere that the sym-
bols appear first, the machine defines
them with some fairly arbitrary address.
But in the example above, every time
one uses the symbol "SUM" the machine
will grind out machine code with the

NEW U-M
RESEARCH GROUP
Off to a fast start, the Institute of Science and
Technology should soon have an important
effect on local and state-wide scientific and
industrial growth.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE, '61E
The automation of ten years from
now, I am convinced, will be so com-
plex and ingenious that it will challenge
the most highly-trained scientific experts
in the world. ... I am convinced that
within a short span of years most of the
world's manufactured goods will be
turned out in highly automated factories,
wherever these factories are located.
There is no law of nature that says
those factories are going to be in Mich-
igan, but by meeting the challenge we
can see to it that they are.
These were the words of U-M physics
professor H. R. Crane, addressing a
gathering in Detroit. The challenge he
referred to was "the meeting of some
of the present critical needs for highly
trained scientists and engineers and the
development of sufficient skilled man-
power to put the state in the foreground
of forthcoming technological advances."
The proposal for meeting this need
which Professor Crane was supporting
was the newly-conceived University of
Michigan Institute of Science and Tech-
nology.
Goals of 1ST
First announced at a Regent's meeting
late in 1957, the manifest goals of the
new Institute are:
1. To serve as a center for scientific
and technological instruction, research
and service on the collegiate and post-
graduate level. The Institute would be
staffed by U-M faculty members and out-
standing new men who could be at-
tracted to the University.
2. To set up and administer a system
of grants for undergraduate and graduate
students who desire to devote themselves
to teaching or to research in the fields
of technology and science. This would be
based on a most thorough and careful
talent search of the State of Michigan.
3. To carry on research in methods
of increasing the effectiveness and extent
of scientific education at all levels.
4. To co-operate with other educa-
tional institutions in the state, both pub-
lic and private, in the encouragement of
scientific and technological research and
instruction. Staff members and nationally-
known scientists would be given time
from teaching duties to work with other
colleges and universities, high schools,
and elementary schools in an effort to
stimulate and encourage interest in ca-
reers in science.
5. To seek the co-operation of busi-
ness and industry in furthering the pur-
poses of the Institute, especially as they
relate to future industrial and business
development in the state. In particular,
it would provide leadership and guidance
for programs designed to train technical
personnel to supplement the work of
professional engineers and scientists and
also to retrain others temporarily dis-
placed by advancing technological pro-
cesses.
The Institute arose from a special re-
port to University President Hatcher by
the U-M Science Advisory Committee,
which noted in its report that the Amer-
ican nation is not producing enough
highly trained people to maintain leader-
ship in the kind of world which scien-
tific advances are creating. Recognition
must be given to the fact that intellect,
ability and brain power are national
assets which can no longer be wasted in
the face of Soviet competition, the com-
mittee said.
Not Crash Program
The committee emphasized that the
Institute was not a "crash program"
occasioned by the Russian sputnik appear-

ances which coincidentally preceded the
announcement by a few weeks. It repre-
sents, the committee said, "deep concern
and serious thought" devoted to the
problem of Russian technological ad-
vancements in all areas, and is based on
years of experience of some of the Uni-
versity's top men in these fields.
As approved by the Regents at their
winter 1957 meeting, the Institute of
Science and Technology would be oper-
ated in a manner similar to the Michigan

Memorial Phoenix Project.
This implies that work would be car-
ried on in existing departments and
schools by making grants to faculty and
staff members. These grants would be
open to the faculty of any Michigan
college or university.
At the time of Professor Crane's
speech early this spring, the fate of the
Regents' proposal was still considerably
uncertain. His view of the value of the
Institute was perhaps more practical, for
he emphasized the benefits which might
accrue to the business of the state through
the operation of a training center for top-
notch engineers and industrial scientists.
Professor Crane said that an invest-
ment of five million dollars through the
Institute over a five-year period "could
bring forth 50 million dollars from the
federal government in research projects,
and that, further, the results of these
projects could bring 500 million dollars
in new industry. I do not think this is
dreaming at all, because it is a chain
reaction that has already happened in
other places."
"We are perfectly aware that right
now funds are next to non-existent—but

ence and Technology.
sometimes when a person finds himself
in a tight spot he finds it wise to put
even his last nickel on something that
may pull him out. I sincerely hope that
the strengthening of science and tech-
nology in the state will be classed in that
category."
Professor Crane said that Michigan
must have four times its present scien-
tific manpower if she ever is to enter
"the big league in space-age science and
technology."
Such an increase is needed to start the
"chain reaction" of research discoveries
which grow into new industries and in-
dustrial applications.
Michigan Lags
Professor Crane pointed to Michigan's
lag behind other states in the area of
basic research. He said that New York
has six times as many physicists engaged
in research as Michigan, California five
times more, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
and Pennsylvania have three times more,
and that Illinois, Ohio, and Connecticut
are also out ahead.
The ratio applies all too closely to
related fields, and Federal funds spent
on such research are certainly admin-
istered preferentially to these states with
large numbers of researchers engaged in
fundamental work.
In summing up the need for definite
progress on the already-approved Insti-
tute, Professor Crane emphasized to his
audience the part that it would play in
the scientific development of the state.
"We recognize that this is only a part
of the total job, but it is an absolutely
essential part, and the one on which we
already have a good start. I cannot em-
phasize too strongly the fact that if you
are going to expand the whole scientific
community in the state, you cannot do
it unless there is a firm anchor of men
who are eminent leading lights and who
give stimulation and enthusiasm and

ideas to all those who are doing the

work."
During July this year the Institute of
Science and Technology became a little
more real with the approval by the
Regents of a set of by-laws, adoption
of a budget, and the appointment of a
director.
Named to the post of director was
43-year-old Dr. Robert R. White, asso-
ciate dean of the College of Engineering
and a professor of chemical and metal-
lurgical engineering.
The budget of $500,000 is covered
by an appropriation from the State of
Michigan, and is especially designated
to "carry out a program of supporting
and encouraging 'frontier area' research
in science and technology."
Objectives
The five objectives of the institute
were incorporated into the newly-made
by-laws:
1. To serve as a center of science and
technology;
2. To provide administrative arrange-
ments and support over and above that
available through existing teaching and
research programs whereby outstanding
engineers and scientists can be brought
to the University and to the State of
Michigan and provided an environment
suitable for conducting research at the
most advanced levels;
3. To assist the separate departments,
schools, colleges, and other University
agencies in conducting research in pure

Six months of training and job assignments in
Albany familiarized him with the Plant, Com-

IBM Engineer Richard R. Booth
explores electronic frontiers
to develop new, faster and
larger storage devices
for tomorrow's computers.

Computing time cut from six months to one day
"My job is to design and develop new, high-speed
storage devices for a powerful new computer that
will perform, in one day, operations requiring six
months on present equipment," said Dick Booth
as he began a typical day recently. A product de-
velopment engineer at the IBM Laboratories in
Poughkeepsie, N. Y., he started his morning with a
conference on a product of great interest to him: a
magnetic core storage device with a nondestructive
read-out feature. For an hour, he discussed with
circuit design engineers the logical devices needed
for the register—such as magnetic core drivers and
sense amplifiers. Should such devices not be avail-
able, the group would work on designs for new ones.
Dick Booth next met with members of the Mag-
netic Materials Group to establish specifications for
the magnetic core memory elements to be used in
the register. He also discussed with the group the
development of equipment to test the memory
elements. "This magnetic core register is based on
an original idea of mine," he explained. "When you
have a worthwhile idea, you will be given a free
hand in proving it out, backed by IBM's resources
— plus the assistance of skilled specialists."

Increasing responsibility
At 10:30, Dick Booth reviewed the status of the
entire project with the two engineers, two tech-
nicians, and one logic designer who make up his
team. "My present position is staff engineer," he
explained. "It's the second promotion I've had
since I joined IBM three years ago with a B.S.E.E.
degree from the University of Illinois. I know that
there are plenty of other opportunities to move
ahead. Furthermore, parallel advancement oppor-
tunities exist for engineers in either engineering
development or engineering management."
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Preparing for the future
In the afternoon, Dick Booth went to the 704 Com-
puting Center to supervise some complex preci-
sion computations. "You see how quickly the 704
arrives at the answers," he said. "The computer
being developed is expected to multiply more than
500,000 fourteen-digit numbers a second and add
them at the rate of one million a second. The com-
puter may be used for design computations for
reactors, as well as calculations of satellite be-
havior. Of course it should have hundreds of other
applications."
At 3:30 P.M., Dick Booth attended a weekly class
on Theoretical Physics that lasted until 5:00. After-
ward, he commented, "You know, IBM offers
excellent educational opportunities both in gen-
eral education and for advanced degrees. One of
the engineers in my group has just received his
Master's degree from Syracuse University, after
completing a postgraduate program given right
here at the IBM Laboratory."

A chance to contribute
As he was leaving for the evening, he said, "Yes,
I'd recommend an IBM career to any college gradu-
ate who wants to exercise his creative ability. IBM
will appreciate his talent and he'll have the oppor-
tunity to work with specialists who are tops in
their fields. I doubt that he'd be able to find a
more sympathetic and stimulating atmosphere.
Furthermore, he'll have the added incentive of con-
tributing to vitally important projects . .. projects
that will take him to the frontiers of knowledge in
computer electronics."
Talented college graduates will find exciting, re-
warding careers at IBM. Excellent opportunities
are now available in Research, Development, Man-
ufacturing, Applied Science, Sales, and Adminis-
tration. Find out from your College Placement

address 0600 which happened to be as-
signed to SUM.
Let us do the same problem in GAT
or "Generalized Algorithmic Translator"
developed at the University of Michigan
Computing Center. The GAT language
allows as variables the letters C, D, X,
Y, Z, I, J, and K. However, each letter
must have a subscript. So let us call the
location we called "FIRST" in the ex-
ample above XI and the one we called
"NEXT" Yl. We shall call the place
"SUM" Z177. Then to do the required
addition in the program, we punch on
a card the following:
Z177
XI -f Yl
and the GAT program generates as out-
put machine code much as we have dis-
cussed above.
On a problem of such simplicity, the
compiler's terrific advantage cannot be
shown, but in long formula evaluation,
its value can be appreciated. Compilers
cannot completely replace assembly pro-
grams because it is necessary to do certain
types of problems, such as certain types
of data processing a level near that of
basic machine in order to do it efficiently.
Undergraduate Courses
Now that we have given examples of
the three main types of computer pro-
gramming systems, let us sketch quickly
some of the courses available to under-
graduates and graduates interested in
computers:
Math. 73. 1 credit hr. A new course
which teaches a compiler (Fortran or
MAD for the IBM 704) as it illustrates
certain basic features of numerical anal-
ysis, such as numerical integration and
numerical solutions to differential equa-
tions.
Math. 173- 3 credit hrs. An intro-
duction to the computing field contain-
ing the algorithm concept, use of flow
diagrams, Boolean algebra, number sys-

laboratory work in the three types of
machine programming outlined above.
Math. 174. 3 credit hrs. An extensive
numerical analysis course, with some
problems done on computers.
Philosophy 114. 3 credit hrs. Mathe-
matical logic with some applications to
computers.

course is a survey of most of the topics
covered also in Math. 173.
Business Administration School: Statis-
tics 150. 3 credit hrs. Data processing
and programming from the business
viewpoint. It includes machine code and
an assembly program, but does not usually
discuss compiler programs.
Of the above courses, eight of them
presuppose no computer experience:
Math. 73, Math. 173, Stat. 150, I.E.
165, E. E. 232, E. 238, Philo. 114,
and Philo. 115. The variety of topics
concerning digital computers at the Uni-
versity can be obtained in more detail
from the catalogues of the respective
schools or colleges.
Special Computer Opportunities
In addition to the regular classes listed
above, the University Computing Center
gives special lectures on programming
systems for University computers such as
the October 1959 series of lectures on
Fortran coding for the IBM 704 com-
puter. Students who learn how to use a
computer on their own or from the
courses listed above may obtain permis-
sion to use the University's computing
facilities free of charge (sponsored-re-

RCA Electronics creates the "501" to streamline the paper work
of business —it reads, writes, figures and remembers on tape
Much of today's traffic jam in paper
work is being eliminated by electronic
data processing. But to build a system
that would be practical and economical
for even medium-sized organizations
was a job for electronic specialists.
To solve the problem, RCA drew on
its broad experience in building com-
puters for military applications and
combed its many laboratories for the
latest electronic advances that could
help. The result was the RCA "501"
high-speed electronic data processing
system—the most compact, flexible, and
economical ever built. It is a pioneer sys-
tem with all-transistor construction for
business use.
The "501" cuts out paper work bottle-
necks for many government agencies
and businesses, from stock brokerage
firms to public utilities, banks, insurance
companies, and steel mills.
It "remembers" millions of letters,
numbers, and symbols that are "read"
onto its magnetic tapes by such things
as punch cards and paper tapes. In a
fraction of a second, it can do thousands
of calculating, sorting, and comparing
operations—and checks each step.
Finally, it writes such things as bills, re-

ports, payrolls in plain English at 72,000
characters per minute.
This economical and practical answer
to an acute business problem is another
way RCA Electronics is helping to sim-
plify the growing complexity of business.

of the decay of these particles were not
identical, therefore they must be different
particles.
The question lingered: why were the
two particles identical in every way ex-
cept this one? It was Lee and Yang who
proposed a solution to the problem. They
boldly suggested that in the case of these
particles the law of parity was not obeyed.
It has been observed that these decays
of the tau and theta were of a class of
newly discovered "weak interactions".
These are nuclear interactions in which
the forces involved are very weak, weaker
even than the force that binds the elec-
trons of an atom. It was suggested by
Lee and Yang that while parity might
hold for all other realms, it need not
hold for the world of tau and theta
decay and other weak interactions.
The Experiment
To verify their theory, they proposed
an experiment. The tau and theta dis-
integrations were too short-lived to ob-
tain satisfactory results. However, the
beta decay of atomic nuclei also belongs
to the group of weak interactions. These
beta decays have a much longer life
time; measured in seconds or even years
depending on the material. Lee and
Yang's proposal for the experiment was
to align the spins of a beta emitting)
nucleus and then observe whether or not
the beta particles were emitted along
a preferred direction. The direction
would have no significance. If parity were
obeyed in this experiment, then it was
expected that the particles would be
emitted equally in all directions. Let us
apply the parity principles and see what
would happen.
In a mirror the spinning nuclei would
rotate in the same sense. However, if
the beta particles were emitted in a pre-
ferred direction, the direction of emission
would be reversed in the image. (Figure
5.) In figure five, if the particles are
emitted along a preferred direction the
mirror image is reversed (situation marked
wrong). This violates parity; to conserve
parity the electrons must be emitted in
both directions to make the mirror image
coincide with the real object. As was
found out in the experiment the mirror
image contradicted the actual situation.
Parity was not conserved!
The experiment was carried out in the

Ambler. The beta emitting nucleus they
chose was cobalt 60 (half-life 5.3 years).
Cobalt 60 decays and emits an electron
(beta particle) and a neutrino, leaving
nickel 60. The nuclei were aligned by
lowering the temperature to 0.1° K. At
this temperature thermal agitation vir-
tually ceases. Then a strong external
magnetic field was applied to align cer-
tain nuclei. The aligned nuclei then ex-
erted a powerful magnetic field on the
remaining nuclei which brought them
into line parallel to the magnetic field.
Under this arrangement the nuclei were
kept oriented for 15 minutes.
By the parity principle it was expected
that beta particles would be ejected
equally in either direction of the aligned

AND
RESEARCH
by BARRY E. PEEBLES, '60E
A quick trip through the portals and
hallways of the U-M buildings and re-
search establishments brings us in rapid
succession to such topics as the dedica-
tion of U-M's new 85-foot radio tele-
scope, a study of automation and ob-
solescence, the "flare patrol", and a few
interesting notes on the education and
faculty scene. So without further ado
let's be off to Peach Mountain and the
new telescope
Telescope Dedicated
Development of instruments like the
University of Michigan's new, 85-foot
steerable radio telescope, which was dedi-
cated in October, should lead to a rapid
accumulation of astrophysical knowledge
in the next few years.
At the dedication ceremonies for the
10-story high telescope U-M Prof. Fred
T. Haddock said the instrument can be
used "to track continuously an active
region on the sun and measure the posi-
tion and possible movement of sources
of centimeter wave emission in the sun's
atmosphere.
A professor of both astronomy and
electrical engineering, Haddock directs
the U-M radio astronomy project. Dis-
cussing the potential value of studies
conducted with the radio telescope, he
continued:
"In studying solar radio bursts we ob-
tain information on a variety of natural
physical processes which may be at work
in other radio sources. This should lead
to a deeper understanding of the physics
of very high temperature gases in mag-
netic fields. A gain in understanding may
in turn prove useful in the design of
hydrogen fusion power sources, space
propulsion engines, or man-made radio
generators, for example.
"The non-solar phase of our research
program . . . This phase involves centi-
meter wavelength studies of planets and
cosmic radio sources.
"Radiation in the centimeter wave-
length band has been measured from the
planets, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn
by other U.S. groups. With the master
receiver developed at the U-M's Willow
Run Laboratories it is hoped that we
will be able to detect emission from the
planet Uranus."
Accepting the radio telescope on be-
half of the University, Vice President for
Research Ralph A. Sawyer noted the
device will serve "not only as a unique
and powerful research tool, but also as
a laboratory for the training of graduate
students in astronomy."
The telescope, located at Peach Moun-
tain, about 16 miles northwest of Ann
Arbor, Sawyer said might have been
placed in another location, freer of
electromagnetic disturbances, had it not
been viewed as an important addition to
the U-M's educational program.
Professor D. L. Kafz, chairman of the
C-M Department, was recently named
the Engineer of the Year by the Mich-
igan Society of Engineers. Professor Katz
is also serving as the national chairman
of A.S.C.E. this year.
Automation and Dignity
Automation and obsolescence should
be viewed more as a measure of man's
progresses and less as a cause for con-
cern, says Aarre K. Lahti, University of
Michigan professor of design.
"Obsolescence, to me, is a measure of
learning and automation is a measure of
human dignity. The more rapidly we
learn, the faster our present concepts,
ideas and output become obsolete," he
says.
"Too many things are becoming ob-
solete at a terrifying rate in our day. It
isn't so much that we are 'shooting
through the roof where this pace is con-
cerned, as that we are 'finally leveling
off' and 'getting going'."
"A repetitive activity reproduceable by
machines is below the dignity of human
performance," Lahti continues. "Our so-
38

ciety can no longer afford the luxury of
unskilled labor. We are faced with the
long overdue task of boosting our ob-
jectives upward—that is, the unskilled
must become the skilled, the skilled must
become the technicians. Those at the top
must scurry to broaden their activities to
meet greater responsibility for human
welfare and to find new philosophies
for living."
Flare Patrol
A minute-by-minute watch of the sun
is being maintained by University of
Michigan astronomers studying solar
flares. The flares are believed to be more
guilty than sunspots of causing the
"jamming" of short-wave radio signals.
The flare patrol work began during
the International Geophysical Year
(IGY) and now is conducted under a
National Science Foundation grant. Prin-
cipal investigator is Orren C. Mohler
(Ph.D), professor of astronomy and
assistant director of the U-M McMath-
Hulbert observatory at Lake Angelus near
Pontiac.
Continuation of the program is part
of a long-term, world-wide effort to
clarify some of the relationships between
solar phenomena and numerous terrestrial
effects, among the most conspicuous of
which are severe disturbances in long
distance wireless and wired communica-
tion.
The connection between sunspots and
flares is not yet accurately understood,
but it is known that sunspots accompan-
ied by flares are the most effective—but
not the only—source of radio interfer-
ence.
It is believed that the flares inject
"puffs" of energy into the earth's at-
mosphere, with an adverse effect on
short-wave and telegraphic communica-
tion. The form of this energy has not
been identified, but astronomers theorize
it could be x-radiation, ultraviolet light,
or actual streams of ions. An ion is an
atom which has gained or lost an electron
and which therefore has a positive or
negative charge.
Whatever its form, the energy dis-
turbs the ionosphere, a layer of elec-

Ann Arbor.
trically charged particles about 100 miles
above the earth against which short-wave
signals are bounced in transmitting sig-
nals to great distances.
The disturbance of the ionosphere
causes "storms" in the earth's magnetic
field which can produce large currents
in electric transmission cables. An aurora
borealis is visible evidence of a magnetic
storm.
Observations are made with a special-
ized telescope of French manufacture.
With it, 35-mm pictures can be taken
every half-minute. If the sun is very
active, picture-taking speed can be in-
creased to eight per minute. On a clear
day, about 1,000 shots are made.
Two of the most difficult research
problems are posed by the observation
that not all flares are followed by dis-
turbances on earth, and that the dis-
turbance can follow closely after the flare
or days later. Hence, a significant aspect
of the flare patrol is to work out a way
to determine which flares will affect
earth, and which won't, and, if so, when.

An Editor of a Top Engineering Publication?
JACK CARROLL, MANAGING EDITOR OF ELECTRONICS MAGAZINE,
ROSE TO A TOP POST IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS
Are Jack Carroll's shoes your size?
"If it's scope you want, try keeping on top of every-
thing that's hot in electronics," says John M. Carroll,
electronics' Managing Editor at McGraw-Hill Pub-
lishing Company.
A Lehigh B.S. graduate in 1950, Jack has become
an industry authority in less than 10 years. "Knowing
that the industry itself is looking to your magazine
for the word on things is the most stimulating part
about it. It's your job to get the thinking of the men
behind everything that's new in the field. You work
with the top of the profession. What engineer can
resist that?"
Wrote in College
In his senior year at Lehigh, Jack got his first real
taste of writing as editor of the college newspaper. He
joined McGraw-Hill as editorial assistant on elec-
tronics in 1950, took a 17-month "leave" in Korea,
then became assistant editor in 1952 and associate
editor in '54.
"By then I'd got my M.A. in physics at Hofstra on
the McGraw-Hill Tuition Refund Plan, where the
company pays half the cost. And since I was pro-
moted to managing editor in 1957, I've been working
after hours on my doctorate in engineering science at
N.Y.U. This is an engineer's outfit. You grow right
along with your industry at McGraw-Hill," says Jack.
"The engineer who chooses a McGraw-Hill career
need have no fear of winding up in a corner on one
part of one project. You work with the new . . . the
experimental . . . the significant. Sitting down with
the leaders of your field is part of the job. Your as-
signment? Interpreting today's advanced thinking for
the rest of your field."

nuclei, i.e. with or against the magnetic
field. However, the experiment showed
that 40% more beta particles were
emitted in a line against the magnetic
field. It was found that the particles were
emitted up when the spin was turning
in one direction and down when the spin
was in the other direction. Under the
conditions of this experiment parity was
not conserved. Remember that the spin
of the nucleus tells only the sense of
rotation and yet electrons emerged in
a preferred direction. From the fact that
there was a definite "handedness" ex-
hibited by cobalt 60 decay and that there
had not been found in nature the "op-
posite hand", it was concluded that parity
had been overthrown.
The results of this experiment were
verified a few weeks later by another
experiment. This time the decay of the
mu meson was observed.
Figure 6 shows the actual curves from
the cobalt experiment. The scale labeled
"time" is actually a scale of temperature.
The curve marked "gamma anisotrophy"
(Continued from page 34)
tells the fraction of nuclei oriented. The
curve labeled "B asymmetry" tells the
number of beta particles emerging in the
direction of the magnetic field and the
number in the opposite direction. We
can see that there are more in one
direction than in the other.
Advance, Not Setback
As a result of these experiments the
field of weak interactions will be studied
with greater intensity in an attempt to
discover the laws which govern these
reactions. Theoretical physicists have only
begun to investigate the possible impli-
cations of these discoveries. One over-all
lesson was learned from the downfall
of this basic law. This is that all the
great invariant laws of nature such as
the conservation of energy and mass may
be relied upon within the realms of their
application, but they are not necessarily
of universal application. It will be worth-
while for physicists to test to a higher
degree of precision the other laws of
nature, including the conservation of
energy and matter. As fas as scientists
have gone the conservation of energy
has held, even in the weak interactions,
but the question arises: does it hold for
the weakest interaction of all—the force
of gravity?
The discovery of the overthrow of
parity may not be a new, ready made,
theory, but by removing a false theory
it may lead to an explanation of the
behavior of the now 30-plus sub-atomic
particles which are the building blocks
of the whole universe. Other theories
such as special relativity and quantum
theory, which were based on the false
parity principle, should be re-examined.
This possibly could lead to a Unified
Field Theory which Einstein sought. Such
a theory would encompass all the laws of
matter, energy, and the universe and
could lead to a bridge between the micro-
physical world of nuclear physics and the
cosmology. This discovery certainly is
not a setback, rather it is an advance
which has opened the doors to the under-
standing of the physical world.

A state legislature committee has given

In an airliner, every pound of weight saved is worth hundreds of dollars
... in revenue-making payload. And in military aircraft, pounds saved mean
added miles-per-hour... or added load carried.
In commercial products ... trucks, cars, materials-handling equipment...
the pounds of dead weight you eliminate by using forgings make money
year-after-year for the operator. The forging process lets you put the metal exactly
where you need it to carry the load, withstand shock or vibration,
endure torsion. And with not a surplus ounce of non-working weight going
along just for the ride.
Forged parts are the designer's friend... strong where strength is needed,

plus the hammer blows or high pressures of the forging process.
Write for literature to help you specify, design, and procure forged parts.

Work Begins on World's
Biggest Engineering Center
Ground breaking ceremonies for the
United Engineering Center, a multi-mil-
lion dollar, eighteen-story structure to
be erected opposite the United Nations
in New York City, were held Thursday,
October 1, 1959, at 11:00 a.m. Former
President Herbert Hoover, representing
the older generation of engineers, shared
earth-turning honors with a freshman
engineering student from Hawaii, Jerry
Fujimoto, representing engineers of the
future.
To occupy a block between 47th and
48th Streets, on United Nations Plaza
(First Avenue), the Center will house
the headquarters of eighteen major engi-
neering societies with a combined mem-
bership of more than 300,000. Together,
the societies are responsible for a major
part of the nation's technical publications,
industrial standards and engineering con-
ferences.
Mr. Fujimoto, an American citizen of
Japanese extraction, enrolled this fall at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy,
New York. He is described as a member
of the newest engineering class, entering
the oldest engineering college in the
country from the newest state in the
Union.
Upon applying for admission to RPI,
college officials revealed, Mr. Fujimoto
wrote, "I have set my goal for the very
top and I will seek it with all my might.
There is the likelihood I will not reach
it; but no matter what heights I may
reach, I will be assured that it will be
higher up the ladder than the height I
might have reached if I were satisfied
with mediocrity."
Several thousand persons were invited
to the October 1 ceremonies, including
representatives of foreign engineering
groups. Major excavation work began
later in the month. The new structure,
scheduled for completion in mid-1961,
will be the largest undertaking ever at-
tempted for the engineering profession.
Plans for the Center have been over
eight years in the making. A fund-raising
campaign has already achieved nearly $5
million in contributions from industry
and $3 million in contributions from
individual engineers.
Andrew Fletcher, president of United
Engineering Trustees, the organization
that will own and operate the structure
on behalf of the engineering societies,
said that, "the primary purpose of the
new structure is to provide adequate
working space for the headquarters staffs
of the engineering groups, which carry
on extensive publishing, research and
standardization programs." The second
purpose, he added, "will be to symbolize
the growing strength and growing unity
of the engineering profession."
'Lazy-Susan' Steel Mold
A steel company has borrowed the
principle of the "lazy-susan" serving dish
in building a series of vacuum-sealed
steel ingot molds. The molds are mounted
in a vacuum-drum enclosed turntable,
which rotates each mold in turn beneath
a 30-ton ladle to receive its charge of
steel.
Collapsible Dam
The Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power has invented a collapsible
synthetic rubber tube dam that saves it
about $75,000 worth of water annually.
Water fills the 150-foot-long tube dam,
which is fastened to a channel bottom,
and inflates it about five feet high. When
flood waters reach a given height, the
tube drains and collapses, allowing the
flood to pass.
Offshore Sulfur Mine
The world's first offshore sulfur mine,
seven miles out in the Gulf of Mexico
off Grand Isle, La., will soon begin oper-
ations. An underwater pipeline heated
by pressurized hot water will carry the
molten sulfur to Grand Isle for pro-
cessing and transshipment.
World's Largest Magnet
The world's largest permanent magnet
is scheduled to work in America's atomic
energy program. It will help pump
liquid sodium in a breeder reactor to

Laboratory for the Atomic Energy Com-
mission. To be known as the Experi-

Falls, Idaho.
The magnet, made by The Arnold
Engineering Company of Marengo, 111.,
weighs 1720 pounds, and is made of
AInico V material. The overall dimen-
sions of the magnet are 521^ by 36 by
10 inches. It has a gap length of l6]/2
inches and a gap volume of 1584 cubic
inches. The density at the center of the
gap is 1100 gausses. About 500,000
ampere turns were needed to magnetize
the unit.
It is customary to use an electromagnet
in pumping the liquid sodium in this
atomic energy application, but in this
instance a large permanent magnet must
be used because the magnet will be
completely surrounded by the liquid
metal.
The magnet was checked in a 3000
hour test at temperatures up to 750
degrees F. prior to its being put into
service at the Argonne National Labora-
tory.
The sodium used in the reactor acts
as a heat transfer medium or "coolant"
in much the same way as water can be
utilized, but sodium does the job better.
The liquid sodium absorbs heat from
within the reactor, then it is pumped


outside to heat water in a heat exchanger filaments or cathodes through the prin-
or boiler. ciple of electroluminescence.

A new automobile rearview mirror—
using a periscope effect—gives a driver
more than twice the view of present
mirrors although the new mirror is only
two inches longer than today's average

is what keeps it rolling in that straight
line. If, instead of rolling, it spins around
an axis through its center, the same
inertia will keep it spinning in its geo-
metric plane of rotation until it loses
speed.
Precession is not so readily explained.
Such an explanation involves a study in
kinetics which is beyond scope of this
article. A ready example may be visual-
ized, however, if you can remember roll-
ing an auto tire by hand. To change the
direction in which the tire is rolled, it
was only necessary to push right or left
at the top ... no one ever had to twist
at that point and certainly no one ever
bent way down to push at the front or
rear. Pushing right or left at the top
brought about a precession of the rolling
tire which changed its direction of roll.
Suppose the gimbal in which the rotor
is mounted is a sealed sphere . . . con-
sider it a rubber ball for purposes of
illustration. Suppose also that this rubber
ball (with the rotor inside) has a neutral
buoyancy in water (it weighs exactly the
amount of an equal volume of water).
These suppositions being true, the ball
will be fully floated, but completely im-
mersed. With the wheel spinning inside,
this ball will have its own stability. If
the axis around which the rotor is spin-
ning (called the spin axis) happens to
point toward a star, it will remain so
aligned as long as the wheel continues
to spin and no external forces are applied
to cause precession. Thus, disregarding
the friction between the water and the
ball (which would actually cause some
precession) the container may be moved
as desired without effect on the position
of the ball. Basically, this simple illus-
tration is analogous to the operation of
a gyro.
The ball in this example represents a
stable object in space. If the water con-
tainer were affixed to an airplane, its
motions would represent the movements
of the airplane; thus the airplane would
move around the stable ball. If some
means of measuring these movements
could be provided, this device might
prove very useful; for example, in de-
termining the airplane's deviations from
straight and level flight. Water, however,
is not conducive to providing any such
measurement means. It is essential, there-
fore, that the motion between container
and ball, as described in the example,
be simulated mechanically. It is seen that
the device is of no practical value as a
means of measuring linear movements.
Gyros measure only rotational move-
ments.
The rotor in the toy gyro mentioned
earlier might be kept spinnnig for several
minutes with a strong pull of the string.
An instrument system, however, must of-
ten operate for hours, and some means
of sustaining wheel rotation must be
provided. In a vast majority of cases,
this means an electric motor. To increase
the gyroscopic effects of the spining mass,
this is an inverted motor (the rotor spins
outside the stator). Air motors, spring
wound motors and a variety of other

A typical demonstration gyroscope
similar to those used in the laboratory,
displays the same properties of naviga-
tion.
means have also been employed, depend-
ing on the detail requirements of the
intended end use.
The string-activated toy gyro ran for
several minutes at most. As its speed of
rotation decreased, the spin axis began
to tip, becoming progressively less stable.
Finally it lost stability completely and
toppled over. From this action, it is ap-
parent that the wheel speed is at least
one factor in the gyro's stability. Actually,
this stability depends on:
1. The speed at which the mass
(rotor) rotates.
2. The amount of mass (effectively
the weight).
3. The radius at which the mass
is rotated.
The net effect of these three factors is
known as the gyro's angular momentum,
normally expressed in gram-centimeter2
per second (e.g., 6.0 x 10r' gm-cm2/sec.).
The higher the momentum, the more
resistance the wheel will have to external
forces. This is often expressed as the
wheel rigidity, stiffness or stability.
Mr. HIG
There are many different types of
gyros but only one will be described . . .
Mr. HIG. Mr. HIG's motor is fully
floated in a special fluid and constrained
in a single axis by means of jewelled
pivots (which establish the precession or
output axis). Mr. HIG is restrained only
by the fluid which tends to impede pre-
cession of the motor housing. This tend-
ency of the fluid to impede precession
is a fixed amount, depending upon the
fluid viscosity, the area, etc. A rate input
to the gyro results in a precession which
overcomes the fluid restraint. However,
for any given input rate (and resultant
precession torque), this fixed restraint
controls the amount of precession as a
function of time (how long the pre-
cession torque is applied). Thus the
displacement of the spin axis (and the
pickoff) is always proportional to the
displacement of the gyro (rate x time =
amount). Thus the gyro receives a rate
input, performs an integration (summing
of rates and times), and produces an
output signal which is proportional to
displacement.
Use of Mr. HIG as a single axis dis-
placement reference involves some ex-
ternal electronics (such as memory cir-
cuits) and his construction is comparably
critical in terms of manufacturing toler-
ances (certain parts have to be polished
to the finess of 1/10,000,000,000 of an
inch — 2,500 times finer than a human
hair).
Today, gyros enable our missiles and
submarines to function properly, but to-
morrow they have even greater possibili-
ties, such as using the rotational move-
ment of electrons to do their work. But
no matter what its form, the gyro is
here to stay.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Sylvania Encourages Scientific Heretics
Who Can Utilize Unique and Unorthodox Thinking in
Making State-of-the-Art Advances in Electronics, Electronic
Countermeasures, Metallurgy, Semiconductors, Radar,
Communications &amp; Navigation Systems, Airborne Defense,
Missiles, Computers, Lighting, Radio, Television, Plastics,
Photography, Chemicals, Wire, Phosphors.
To the young engineer and scientist
who questions present hypotheses and
who can combine unorthodox percep-
tion with imagination, Sylvania ex-
tends a climate of achievement. From
these men, Sylvania foresees a number
of tomorrow's breakthroughs. If your
ambition is to attain your fullest pro-
fessional potential, these facts about
Sylvania —one of the world's fastest
growing industrial organizations —
merit your close attention.
Started as a basement industry
manufacturing incandescent lamps
only 59 years ago, Sylvania today has
23 laboratories and 46 plants located
in 14 states across the nation. These
69 modern facilities afford employ-
ment to over 30,000 people. In the
last 25 years sales have climbed from
$6,000,000 to over i/3 of a billion dol-
lars. Strong as this industrial base is
for the engineer and scientist, it was
substantially reinforced in February
1959 when Sylvania merged with
General Telephone Corporation. The
merger of these two growth com-
panies will:
• Increase ability to finance future
growth and development
• Add further diversification to al-
ready broad commercial and defense
product lines
• Measurably increase research and
development facilities
• Give Sylvania the benefit of
General Telephone's wide experi-
ence and background in foreign
manufacturing and sales.
Sylvania Prizes Individuality
Sylvania's success and reputation
have long been based on the belief
that the success of the organization
depends upon the personal success of
the individual. The engineer/scientist-
oriented management has given much
thought and study to provide an en-
vironment that kindles self-expression
and creativity. Here you are assigned
to a position where you can direct
your training toward its greatest po-
tential. Promotion from within the
company gives impetus to your pro-
fessional progress; assignments are
frequently reviewed.
There is no predetermined pattern
of orientation, for the speed with
which this is accomplished is up to
the graduate; you are given a number
of assignments with increasing
responsibilities. Working directly
with a project leader or senior
engineer, you quickly confirm your
special abilities and aptitudes.
Large-Organization Strength
With Small-Company
Flexibility
Each laboratory or plant is similar
to an independent business at Syl-
vania. Important decisions are made
on the operating level by technical
managers familiar with the problem
at hand, who appreciate and accur-
ately evaluate individual contributions.
Whether your interests center on
engineer management or scientific
specialization, you will enjoy parallel
paths for development at Sylvania —
double opportunity to move forward
with equal reward and status. Syl-
vania encourages the publication of
research articles, active participation
in professional groups, attendance at
meetings of engineering and profes-
sional societies. It has long been
Sylvania's philosophy that these "ex-
tracurricular" activities are of im-
measurable importance to both the
company and the individual, for com-
munication increases comprehension
and scientific curiosity—which are the
forces that spark experimentation and
discovery.
Continual Advances
In State-Of-The-Art
The success of Sylvania in the ad-
vanced areas of electronics has been
maintained over the years by scien-
tific and engineering excellence. Syl-
vania's encouragement of uninhibited
technological thinking has led to a
number of important breakthroughs
across many technologies, such as:
Data Processing Systems; Com-
puters; Semiconductors; Electronic
Flash Approach System; Space Tech-
nology; Ceramic Stacked Tube;
Electroluminescence; Bonded Shield
Television Picture Tubes; Sarong
Cathode Coating; First 110° Televi-
sion Set.
Generous Benefits
Sylvania's belief in the well-being of
the individual has been amply dem-
onstrated by liberal employee policies.
Ranging from a savings and retire-
ment plan to financial reimbursement
for graduate study, these policies have
helped set a standard for the elec-
tronics industry.

Learn now that society will provide for you. Just because you are you. Just because
you are paying for an education doesn't mean you have to get your money's worth.
Don't be ridiculous. "If the learner hasn't learned," it isn't your fault, surely.
1. GENERAL ATTITUDE—The B.B.A. degree is valuable. Successful grads have made
it so. It is valuable because they produced. Let them keep up the good work, but don't
prepare to rob them of their glory, to increase the value.
2. BE YOUTHFUL—Be young while you can. Why discard those good old high school
days—and ways? Don't grow up until you just have to. People will always be under-
standing and appreciative of your adolescence.
3. DRESS—Be yourself, dress naturally. Those business people can be very stuffy
about sartorial matters. On that first job, they'll probably start you off as a porter any-
way, so' why not look like one?
4. AROMATICS—The pungency of the locker room can be carried with you. A gamey
"athletic" odor is a great personal asset—in class and out, in business and out—and
fast. Carry your own atmosphere—be "aromatic."
5. RELAX, ENJOY IT—A stiff posture restricts absorption. Spread yourself figura-
tively. Chairs in front, occupied or not, are fine for parking feet, thus facilitating relaxation.
6. MENTAL EFFORT—Some say that brain cells, like liquor bottles, can not be used
twice. Save them, coddle them, spare them—in class and out. The mind(?) you save
may be your own.
7. DON'T ANTICIPATE—Who knows what might happen tomorrow—or for that matter
next week, when the paper is due? Don't do it ahead of time—nothing might happen.
Then you'd have no excuse.
8. ACCURACY—Is for the birds. A misplaced decimal point is embarrassing but not
critical. You can always do it right when and if you get a job (on the basis of your ex-
cellant school record, of course).
9. DON'T WRITE, TELEGRAPH—Legibility went out with long underwear. None of the
really big wheels like Napoleon, Hitler, or even Confucius—could write good English.
10. SPELLING—Why bring that up? Phonetics are out, "word picture" didn't work, so
your generation just can't spell. Everyone understands and is so sorry. You are unique
—now don't go and spoil it.
11. LATE PAPERS—Promptness here is a sign of servility. Be independent. Be different.
A few days late shouldn't matter, especially if you use a good standard explanation.
12. BE LATE—A "fashionable" entrance, after everyone else is seated, and the class
is moving along—this calls attention to one, definitely. You can also be so ignorant
about what has gone before and get the spotlight again.
13. ATTEND IRREGULARLY—That's the stuff. Always being there is dreadfully bor-
ing. After all, one meeting is like another and the instructor gets tired of your face, too.
14. BE CONVERSATIONAL—Talk it up. If the old buzzard doesn't make it interesting,
it surely can't be interesting to your neighbor, can it? Competition is good for business,
so why not for business educators?
15. PREPARATION—A dangerous habit. Here again, let's don't anticipate. A heavy
snow might make the work useless. And—the instructor might resent having you come to
class one day knowing what he is talking about.
16. (BUT OTHERWISE) CLAM UP—Don't ever venture an opinion, don't defend a
point; let some other jerk stick his neck out. Remember it may be better to remain silent
and be thought ignorant—than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.
17. ON YOUR MARK—Don't get left at the post when the bell rings. A rustling of
papers and plopping of books indicates alertness on your part to the hour of parting and
reminds the Professor accordingly.
18. REPETITION—A powerful force. Ii the files show that someone did a good paper
on the topic last year, why should such a gem be discarded? The instructor will never
recognize it if your pal was at MSU.
19. PLAGIARISM—If in preparing a paper you find that some author has said it
better than you can; and a long time ago—don't dull initiative. Let him have his way—
in your paper, too. It should be flattering to him.

All of you ambitious scholars (and
even the seniors) should have your mind
limbered up, after the siege of mid-term
exams, so let's see how well you can
do with this month's Tecbnic Teasers.
1. What two numbers composed of
only ones will give the same results by
their addition or multiplication?
2. A boat is carrying cement blocks
in a small pond. It capsizes and the
blocks drop to the bottom of the pond.
The boat is righted and emptied of
water. The question is: Will the level
of the pond rise or drop because of the
blocks on the bottom?
3. A checker board has two squares in
diagonally opposite corners removed. You
have 31 dominos which each can cover
two squares and you are asked to place
them upon the remaining 62 squares on
the checkerboard so that each square is
covered with half of a domino. The
dominos are unfortunately uncuttable.
After trying this task, and I suggest
you do so on paper, you will find it quite
impossible. Now here is the question:
Why is it impossible?
Warning: The answer, although elus-
ive, is very simple, so if you want to
be able to live with yourself, give it a
good try.
4. What is the smallest number in
which the digits are reversed when 2
is added to its double?
5. A number of chickens and horses
are standing in a barn. The total number
of heads and wings equals the number
of feet. What percentage of the total
number of animals are horses?
6. Three Indians, two Crows and one
Blackfoot, were confronted by a tourist.
Now Crows have the habit of always
lying to tourists, but a Blackfoot never
tells a lie. The tourist, aware of these
habits, asked the first of these Indians
his nationality. The Indian replied in a
dialect the tourist could not understand.
So he asked the other Indians what the
first had said. The second replied that
the first had said he was a Crow, but
the third answered that the first had
said that he was a Blackfoot. If you
were the tourist what type of Indian
would you say each was?
7. In ancient times the neophyte in
logic was posed such questions as:
If half of 5 were 3, what would a
third of 10 be?
8. Suppose that you have a bucket
containing a gallon of water and a demi-
john containing a gallon of wine. Meas-
ure out a pint of wine, pour it into the
water, and mix thoroughly. Then measure
out a pint of the mixture from the
bucket and pour it into the demijohn.
At the end of these strange proceed-
ings, have you more or less water in the
demijohn than there is wine in the
bucket?
9. Anyone who pulls out pencil and
paper for this one is disqualified and
must transfer to fine arts. If a brick
balances evenly with three quarters of
a pound and three quarters of a brick,
what is the weight of a whole brick?
Quick!

DUNHAM-BUSH


DEANE KEUCH
Purdue University '53
'eane Keuch, one of 136 Dunham-Bush sales
engineers, knows the advantages of being associated with a
dynamic young company with extensive product lines.
Following his engineering studies at Purdue, Deane joined
Dunham-Bush as a trainee and soon became an application
engineer. After a relatively short time he was assigned his own
territory, working out of the Cleveland area sales office.
In calling on consulting engineers, architects, plant engineers,
wholesalers, contractors and building owners, Deane (like all
Dunham-Bush sales engineers) finds it reassuring to be backed by
his area office and the facilities of Dunham-Bush laboratories.
Equally reassuring is the availability of complete lines. The range
of Dunham-Bush refrigeration products runs from compressors
to complete systems; the range of air conditioning products
extends from motel room conditioners to a hospital's entire air
conditioning plant. The heating line is equally complete: from a
radiator valve to zone heating control for an entire apartment
housing project. The Dunham-Bush product family even includes
specialized heat transfer products applicable to missile use.
If you'd like to know more about the company
that offers "Sales Engineering Unlimited", send for a copy of
"This is Dunham-Bush".

search pays $300 hour for the same fa-
cilities) for work on worthwhile prob-
lems of their own.
The University of Michigan Comput-
ing Center is equipped with an IBM 704
computer and a library of useful sub-
routines of common functions. It also has
extensive peripheral equipment such as
reproducing punches, card punches, card
sorters, an IBM 407 printer, etc. As well
as student problems, the facilities are
used for work of the UMRI, Survey
Research Institute, and other campus re-
search organizations.
From this brief survey of the computer
opportunities at this University, one of
the leaders in the field, it is already
apparent that computers are going to
have an increasingly more profound ef-
fect upon engineering, business, and
science education. Already approximately
1,000 students per year are taking part
in at least one computer-oriented course
at this university. It is likely that the
type of engineering education also is
going to be affected. When one can grind
out exact or nearly exact answers on a
computer, there will be no need for the
crude approximations and rules of thumb
approved by the engineering societies as
good engineering practice. Using com-
puters should force engineers to learn
the most general approaches and will
make it necessary for them to know far
more mathematics.
As the computer field develops, more
and more people will be able to use
computers while knowing fewer and few-
er details of their operation, by using
elaborate compilers like the MAD (Mich-
igan Algorithmic Decoder) which is
being developed for the IBM 704. How-
ever, the people who have problems
which must be done at machine level to
be done efficiently must use an assembly
program and know more and more details
about the machine they are using. And
finally someone must design new larger,
faster machines that may rival or even
surpass the human intellect in some re-
spects. It seems likely that all these
types of people can be educated as an
evolutionary consequent of current edu-
cational policies of the University.

At Convair-Fort Worth, you'll find a new
outlook ... a new perspective in the engi-
neering organization . . . one whose objective
is to provide a framework from which each
engineer can contribute his best individual
effort toward achieving the best combination
of ideas.
This is one reason why so many experienced,
well-trained men with creative ability and
inquiring minds are taking a close look at
the advantages of joining a team whose
advanced thinking is so vividly portrayed
by the all-new B-58, America's first and
fastest supersonic bomber.
Living in Fort Worth has its advantages, too.
There is no state income or sales tax, ade-
quate housing in all price ranges, no com-
muting problem. Descriptive literature will be
supplied on request, or send a complete res-
ume' of your training and experience for care-
ful evaluation by engineers in the areas best
suited to your qualifications. To be assured
of prompt attention and strict confidence,
address your inquiry to P. O. Box 748C.

Pedro had recently been married and

A farmer was driving past an insane
asylum with a load of fertilizer when
an inmate called to him:
"What are you hauling there?"
"Fertilizer," replied the farmer.
"What are you going to do with it?"
"Put it on my strawberries."
"You ought to live here, we get cream
and sugar on ours."

A young engineer got a job in a re-
mote mining camp. On his first day off,
he approached the boss and asked: "Say,
boss, what do you folks do around here
for amusement?"
The boss replied, "Well, all of us
usually watch Sam, the cook, drink a
gallon of whiskey, gasoline, and red
pepper juice. It's the funniest thing you
ever saw. Why don't you come along?"
The young engineer was obviously
shocked. "No thanks," he said, "I don't
go for that kind of amusement."
"Well," answered the boss, "I sure
wish you'd come. We really need six men
for this thing."
"Why is that?" asked the new man.
"Some of the boys have to hold Sam.
He don't go for that kind of amusement
either."
Three small boys were sitting on a
curb. One had a model airplane; one a
fire engine, and one was reading Es-
quire. An elderly gentleman stopped and
asked what they wanted to be when they
grew up.
The first said, "An airplane pilot."
The second, "A fireman."
The third boy, looking up from his
magazine, replied, To heck with the
details, I just want to grow up."

"Now sir. You've applied for a job
as switchman. What would you do if
you saw two trains approaching on the
same track?"
"I'd throw the lever and switch one
onto another track."
"And if the lever was jammed?"
"I'd turn the signals to red by hand."
"And if the signals were jammed?"
"I'd grab a red flag and run out on
the track.'"
"And if the engineer didn't see you?"
"I'd send for my sister."
"Your SISTER? What could she do?"
"Nothing. She loves to watch train
wrecks."

Once upon a time there were three
bears. One morning they came down to
breakfast and Papa Bear looked at his
bowl and cried, "Someone's eaten my

Baby Bear looked at his bowl and
cried, "Someone's eaten all my porridge."
"Sit down and shut up," said Mama
Bear. "It ain't poured yet."

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The word space commonly represents the outer, airless regions of the universe.
But there is quite another kind of "space" close at hand, a kind that will always
challenge the genius of man.
This space can easily be measured. It is the space-dimension of cities and the
distance between them ... the kind of space found between mainland and off-
shore oil rig, between a tiny, otherwise inaccessible clearing and its supply
base, between the site of a mountain crash and a waiting ambulance—above all,
Sikorsky is concerned with the precious "spaceway" that currenUy exists be-
tween all earthbound places.
Our engineering efforts are directed toward a variety of VTOL and STOL
aircraft configurations. Among earlier Sikorsky designs are some of the most
versatile airborne vehicles now in existence; on our boards today are the ve-
hicles that can prove to be tomorrow's most versatile means of transportation.
Here, then, is a space age challenge to be met with the finest and most practical
engineering talent. Here, perhaps, is the kind of challenge you can meet.

An English hostess, when serving
wine, remarked to one gentleman: "I
shouldn't be offering you wine. You are
head of the Temperance League."
"Oh no," he replied. "I'm head of the
Vice League."
"Well," she said, "I knew there was
something I shouldn't offer you."

She: Sir, I'll have you know that I

A young school teacher said to her

The analyst was concerned about the
results of a Rorschach Test he had just
given, for the patient associated every
ink blot with some type of sexual ac-
tivity.
"I want to study the results of your
test over the week-end," he said. "Then
I'd like to see you again on Monday
morning."
"OK, Doc," the man agreed. And
then as he was slipping on his coat, he
said, "I'm going to a stag party tomor-

borrow those dirty pictures of yours?"

"Professor," said the engineer in search
of knowledge, "will you try to explain
to me the theory of limits?"
"Well, John, assume that you have
called on a pretty woman. You are seated
at one end of the divan and she is
seated at the other. You move halfway
toward her. Then you move half of the
remaining distance toward her. Again
you reduce the distance separating you
from her by 50 per cent. Continue this
for some time. Theoretically, you will
never reach the girl. On the other hand,
you will soon get close enough to her
for practical purposes."

"Now children," said the kindergarten
teacher, "we'll draw what we'd like to
be when we grow up."
At the end of twenty minutes everyone
handed in a picture except little Butch
McGurk. His paper was blank.
"Why Butch," remonstrated the teach-
er, "isn't there anything you want to be
when you grow up?"
"Sure teacher," replied little Butch.
"I'd like to be married, but I don't know
how to draw it."

The occupants of a parked car were

The house guests were assembled with

These students won $9,000 for bridge designs
American Bridge Division of United States Steel
recently awarded $44,000 in world-wide competition
for the best designs of small steel bridges. Professional
engineers and college engineering students partici-
pated. Designs came in from 50 states and 40 foreign
countries. From these entries, 15 winners were chosen,
eight professional awards and seven student awards.
They were selected under the supervision of the
American Institute of Steel Construction. The judges
were prominent consulting engineers and architects.
They judged the designs on the basis of originality,
economy, appearance and the utilization of steel. The
bridges had to carry two-lane traffic over a four-lane
interstate highway in accordance with AASHO stand-
ards. In addition to the winners, many of the designs
entered were so outstanding that they will be pub-
lished later.
Bridge design is a good example of what can be
done with steel and imagination. But, it's only one
example. There are thousands of other uses for steel
. . . and it takes thousands of men to make and sell
steel. If you want to know about engineering oppor-

into the
nature of things
At the General Motors Research Laboratories, physicists employ
radioactive isotopes and other ultra-modern techniques and tools
in their search for new scientific knowledge and an understanding
of the many laws of nature that continue to perplex mankind.
Although a lot depends on a man's ability, enthusiasm and
growth potential, there's every chance for advancement in
many fields for General Motors scientists and engineers. There's
virtually no limit to opportunity at GM. Fields of work are
as varied as radioactive isotope research, astronautics, auto-
mobiles, aircraft engines and inertial guidance systems—to
mention but a few.
If you wish to pursue postgraduate studies, GM offers financial
aid. And since each GM division is autonomous yet related,
you can grow in two directions—up through your own division,
or to the side to other divisions.

Payola - Right or Wrong?
Headlines cry our "Quiz Program Rigged,"
"Disc Jockeys accept payola," "Bribery." Sensation-
alist journalism of our big newspaper recently dealt
a devastating blow to Big Business by indicating
that they made suckers of American Radio and TV
Public. Retaliating legislators have lent their support
to the public with angered threats of preventive
legislation to cure what is purely an ethical problem
and should be solved accordingly.
First, what is the question? It is not easily de-
fined for it has many diverse implications, but in
the writer's mind it may be summed up as follows.
Should John Q. Public be hoaxed into accepting non-
partisan reports which are in actuality, commercials
of Big Business! False advertising is not meant here,
for that is carefully controlled by product legislation
similar to the Pure Food and Drug Act; however,
the question does imply that by sponsor identifica-
tion, that Big Business is a great guy and you should
buy his product irregardless of its merits.
There are many different ways in which this hoax
is pulled. The record industry has seemed to have
gone off on a little separate tangent in the respect
that it has bribed the disc jockeys, who in turn, play
their records so as to introduce them to the public.
This eliminates much of the time delay between man-
ufacturing and the top 40 positions, but however,
has little effect on the record being a hit. Now, how
much different is that in comparison than the engi-
neer who accepts gifts and is wined and dinned by a
vendor who wishes to get his recommendation
for a public or private contract, is a long estab-
lished custom in big business? And just how much
persuaded is that politician, who has been receiving
gifts for many years, in giving contracts to the
company to which he is most familiar. All these
different types of friendly persuading, fall under the
same ethical question of just how much should one
take in gifts before it is considered bribery. Do not
be too harsh in enswering this question, for you
some day will most certainly be put in this position
with all its advantages.
Second, what can be done about hoaxing the
public and the partisan-non-partisan reports. Those
who advocate powerful legislation now have
a solid stepping stone on which to base their argu-
ments for preventive legislation. It is apparent that
these legislators may not take the question any
further than the control of the Federal Communica-
tions Commission. Now is the time to decide wheth-
er that is sufficient, or should legislation go still
further in the prevention of all types of hoaxes,
bribery, and dealing that might cause the public to
be mislead. Are not all types of cheating the public
just as bad or has some imaginary line been drawn?
However, if legislation does try to cover the com-
plete question, it will never succeed. The cry of
"Civil Rights Trespassing" will rise from the land
and good legislation may be caught up with
the leftest legislation and be swept down that whirl-
pool of bad law.
No, the answer is not in preventative legislation,
but rather in the education of the people, so that
they maw recognize the ethical question; this ac-
complished, the public may use its buying power
and other influences in reflection of their opinion,
and in so doing, rather assures itself that any future
occurances would be greatly curtailed. It is obvious,
that an alert people of strong ethical and moral
convictions need not suffer the humilitation of con-
stant hoaxes.

For many years the accepted theory of color has stated that all colors must be present to pro-
duce a full spectrum in an object such as a transparent slide projected on a screen. Now,
however, it has been discovered that by using two black and white slides taken with different
colored filters and projecting them on a screen simultaneously through their filters, a full color
picture is observed. This month's cover designed by Barbara Finocchi illustrates this theory.

Provide Engineers
Greater Opportunity for
Space-Age Advancement
Young engineers, particularly, will be interested in the new
opportunities created by Chance Vought's recent realignment
into five divisions.
Today, for every Vought engineer, there is a division to
make fullest use of his talents and to speed his personal
advancement. And, of course, he is backed by the four other
divisions whose balanced activities add security to his
company and his future.
Vought's realignment was the result of considerable study
of both company capabilities and new business opportuni-
ties. The move intensifies a diversification program which
began early in 1959. It specifically gears this progressive,
42-year-old aircraft firm for the challenges and opportunities
of the age of space.

ASTRONAUTICS DIVISION
Vought is taking fullest advantage of its existing capabilities
and is drawing on 12 years' experience in the missile field to
obtain broader responsibilities in the race for space. Concen-
tration will be on advanced vehicles for space exploration,
and On ballistic and anti-ballistic missile systems.
Under a current contract, Vought is readying the four-stage
Scout research rocket and its launcher for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Also, Vought and
other members of the Boeing team are participating in the
development of the Dyna-Soar boost-glide vehicle in compe-
tition tor an Air Force contract. In the human factors of
flight, Vought is taking the lead with its orbital flight
simulator and space-oriented Cockpit Laboratory.
AERONAUTICS DIVISION
Weapons of many types will take shape here. For example:
new generations of manned aircraft and atmospheric mis-
siles, and devices for antisubmarine warfare. Systems to
support these weapons, and subcontracting assignments are
other Aeronautics activities.
Among this division's current contracts: a Navy order for
development of an environmental protection and escape
capsule for aircraft pilots. Other work includes production
contracts for three versions of F8U Crusader aircraft, study
contracts in submarine detection and classification, and
subcontracts for military and commercial aircraft assemblies.
ELECTRONICS DIVISION
Vought electronics will be developed, manufactured and
marketed in increasing volume. Military systems under devel-
opment include antennas and related electronics, ground
support electronics and antisubmarine warfare apparatus.
RESEARCH DIVISION
In a new Research Center, scientists of this division will mine
new knowledge from many fields. Basic research is planned
into astronautics, undersea warfare, the life sciences (relat-
ing to human factors of flight), electrogravities and other
areas. As it evolves into applied research, this advanced
work will materially support other Vought divisions.
RANGE SYSTEMS DIVISION
Twelve years' experience in remote base operation qualifies
Vought for additional business in this new field. The Range
Systems team will establish and operate test ranges and test
equipment for missiles and space vehicles.
Genesys Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary company,
intensifies Vought's diversification into commercial elec-
tronics. Company emphasis is on automation, and its key
personnel are engineers experienced in the fields of
electronics, computers, magnetic memory, and associated
electro-mechanical devices.

v
POLLUTION
SOLUTION
With industrial firms, autos, and homes spew-
ing forth increasing quantities of chemical re-
agents, air pollution is becoming a very serious
problem.
by PATRICIA SOROKIN, '63 LSA
Since January I, 1946, nearly
30,000 installations of new heat-
ing, power and mechanical equip-
ment, having a value of $14,000,-
000, have been made in Cincinnati
in compliance with the technical
requirements of the smoke ordi-
nance for cleaner and safer opera-
tion.
In 1948 in the small town of
Donora, Penn. twenty people died
and thousands became ill as a result of
a combination of air pollution and fog,
or smog as it is now known. Similar
incidents occured in London in both
1948 and 1952 when several thousand
people died.
These facts lead one to ask, "what
has happened to man's clean, fresh air?
Why has the atmosphere suddenly been
contaminated by foreign matter?" The
answer lies in the fact that man has
made great technological advances in in-
dustrial might. For years man has
worked for convenience and ease in his
daily life by developing highly complex
industrialization. And as a result indus-
try, autos, and homes pour new poison-
ous gases into the air each day. Some
are detrimental and others aren't harm-
ful in themselves but become so when
activated by sunlight.
Most of the poisons of air pollution
are a direct result of combustion of one
type or another. For example in New
York alone, thirty million tons of coal
are burned annually releasing 1.5 billion
tons of SO, plus two million tons of
H..SO, and other pollutant vapors. This
is only one of many types of combus-
tion carried on annually in a city. Ac-
cording to Dr. Leslie A. Chambers, di-
rector of research for the Los Angeles
Air Pollution Control District, there are
six types of combustion responsible for
the noxious gases produced in most com-
munities. Dr. Chambers has summarized
his findings as follows:
Smog Effects
As it was indicated in the opening
paragraph it has been found that air
pollution presents many perils to health.

eases and chronic bronchitis are also di-
rectly associated with air pollution. But
death and illness are just one of the
effects of smog.
Sunlight acting upon gasoline exhaust
with nitrogen oxides serving as a catalyst
yield ozone which causes excessive crack-
ing of rubber and irritation of the eyes,
nose, and throat. Petroleum refining en-
volves the combustion of fuel which
yields sulfur dioxide pollutants. Sulfur
dioxide in turn reacts with the air giving
off sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid va-
pors. SOo injures sensitive plants such
as flowers and corrodes metals such as
steel. Sulfuric acid mist reduces visibility
considerably and causes fog to pervade.
Burning fuel daily in homes results in
sootfall which deteriorates paint and
causes extensive cleaning bills.
Industry at Fault?
For decades, industry has been called
the chief instigator of air pollution
problems. Back in the late 1600's the
inhabitants of London complained of in-
dustrial contamination of air. Ever since
then, whenever the problem arose, in-
dustry has received a great deal of dese-
crating publicity.
Even today, we constantly meet such
cases. In Baton Rouge, the city is trou-
bled by petrochemical fumes. Down in
Florida, phosphate mining spreads dam-
aging fluorides to fruit crops. Out in the
West in Colorado and Utah, the fresh
air is polluted with uranium clouds and
in Buffalo, New York, the steel mills
create foul air problems. Even on the
west coast Oregon farmers are suing
an aluminum company for damages to
crops and animals.
From coast to coast the sounds re-
sound of the evils which industry is
putting into the air. Yet, the major
blame for air pollution today does not
lie with the industrial producers them-
selves, but with the citizens.
The major cause of air pollution is
each individual home across the coun-
try. For people have no way of
filtering the foreign matter which is
released from the combustion of coal,
fuel oil, or trash. Exhaust fumes from
automobiles are the second greatest con-
tributors to the problem, followed finally
by industrial pollution itself.
Action!!
Because of this great alarm about the
number of contaminants being placed in
the atmosphere, people began to take
action. As a result, many municipalities
and counties set up boards and com-
mittees to solve their problems. Next the
states took a hand in solving the prob-
lems in their particular areas.
It was in 1950 that the first federal
Air Pollution Conference was held. In
1954, the White House informally sug-
gested that the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare set up an Ad Hoc Interdepart-
mental Commission. It was to be com-
posed of representatives from the de-
partments of Agriculture, Commerce,
Defense, Interior, and the National Sci-
ence Foundation. The idea was approved
and put into effect. The first meeting
was held November 16, 1954 and the
Surgeon General of the United States
Public Health Service was appointed
chairman.
For a year they could do little. But
then in 1955 a federal legislative act

was passed so that this committee could
officially carry out a program of re-
search and technical assistance under the
supervision of the Secretary of Health.
Education, and Welfare with the Surgeon
General directing the work.
The first thing the committee did was
to define air pollution: "Community air
pollution is the presence in the ambient
atmosphere of substances put there by
the activities of man in concentrations
sufficient to interfere directly or indi-
rectly with his comfort, safety, or health,
or with the full use and enjoyment of
his property. In general, it does not
refer to the atmospheric pollution cred-
ited to employment in areas where work-
ers are employed, nor is it concerned
with airborne agents of communicable
disease, nor with overt or covert acts
of war."
With this definition in hand, to-
gether with an appropriation of not more
than five million dollars annually, the
committee set up its program which con-
tained five set undertakings.
1. To undertake research—individ-
ually or co-operatively;
2. To encourage cooperative activi-
ties between state, local, and
federal agencies;
3. To collect and disseminate infor-
mation on the subject;
4. To conduct investigations and to
survey specific problems con-
fronting various state and mu-
nicipal governments;
5. To make grants and enter into
contracts for research, training,
and demonstation projects;
With these tools in hand the prob-
lem is being tackled. Despite the im-
pressiveness of the federal government's
work, it is only one-fifth of what is
being done nationally. For four-fifths of
air pollution control is being conducted
on state and municipal levels.
The federal government can't promul-
gate air pollution standards, issue regu-
lations, or engage in the enforcement of
any existing anti-pollution measures.
They spend four-fifths of their time and
money on research and a fifth of their
annual appropriation goes into technical
assistance and training grants.
On the state level each government
is working on the particular problems
in their area. New York, New Jersey,
and Connecticut have joined forces in
fighting pollution by forming a singular
air pollution control board. Since their
respective problems are almost identical,
they use similar techniques in solving
them.

being done on the municipal level. An
outstanding example is Los Angeles.
There, a multimillion-dollar project is
under way and oil refineries in the
area have cut their pollution 80% at
a cost of 33 million dollars.
Research
However, tracking down air pollution
and relating specific effects is by no
means an easy task. It requires money,
patience and time plus a host of spe-
cialists such as engineers, analytical
chemists, scientists, meteorologists, train-
ed weathermen, doctors, statiticians and
cost accountants. With these facts in
mind, let's examine a few of the results
and methods of the various research
groups.
Through research the contaminants
have been classified into two groups. The
first consists of visible particles in which
there are some thirty odd chemicals in-
cluding: CI, Fl, Nitrates, SO,, As, Ba,
Be, and Bi. Invisible gaseous and va-
porous particles head the second group.
This, in turn, is broken down into in-
organic materials such as oxides of S,N,
and CO and organic materials, as hydro-
carbons, aldehydes, and ketones.
There are over 230 air sampling sta-
tions in city and rural areas across the
country. Here air samples are collected.
Delicate and complicated mechanisms
are used to gather and analyze these
substances. Particles are sucked into a
modified vacuum cleaner device which
collects 700,000 cubic feet of air in
twenty-four hours. The opening is a
vertical one to avoid conflicting winds.
Solids and liquids fall into different
compartment after passing through fil-
ters. The solid specimens are collected
on 6 square inch filter sheets made of
glass fibers. These specimens are then
carefuly bundled and sent on to an
analytical laboratory. The mixture of gas-
eous air must be packed in an air-tight
container before being forwarded.
At the laboratory, solid samples are
carefully weighed and cut into pieces
for different analyzing processes while
the organic and inorganic gases are sep-
arated from their mixtures by passing
them through various solvents. The next
step involves subsequent fractionation
and detailed analysis. In some cases, ex-
aminations by infrared spectroscopy are
also conducted.
Such research has brought many un-
knowns to light after a careful tabula-
tion of recent findings and a com-
parison with statistics gathered at an


Over a period of years, this residential area in Columbus, Ohio was freed from a
great air pollution situation.
earlier date.
From there research scientists can
now predict what will happpen when
certain pollutants are in the area and
certain weather conditions are arising.
This is of great benefit to farmers for
they have been instructed on what to
do in various cases and this results in
saving many dollars worth of crop dam-
age.
But the problem still isn't completely
under hand. For by 1970, the popula-
tion will have increased 25% and in-
dustrial activity will have doubled. This
will result in more burning, more in-
complete combustion, and more garbage
in the sky. Four fields of concentrated
study offer possible results for future
researchers. They are:
1. Greater field investigations and
statistical studies aimed at a better un-
derstanding of air pollution and its in-
fluence on geographical distribution of
diseases and death. Surveys are now
being conducted in California and Ten-
nessee.
2. Associations between air pollution
and the respiratory system must be ex-
plored further. A new device to test
lung functions under various conditions
has just been patented and will be of
great use in their field of research.
3. A more concentrated study of air
pollution and its resulting cancerous and
cardiac effects could bring down the
death rate in these two ailments. Such
research is now being carried out in Los
Angeles, California and London, Eng-
land.
4. Last, but not least, the biological
and chemical impact of specific pollutants
must be studied intensely to prohibit
further damage to humans and their
property.
Only when a better understanding
has been gained in these particular areas
will man be able to relax and stop
worrying about the problems he has
brought upon himself through his search
for industrial might.

A radical new theory has been proposed by
Edwin Land, developer of the Polaroid camera,
may soon replace the classical theory of color.
by JAY SKLAR, '60E
Almost three hundred years ago, a
man named Isaac Newton pur-
chased a toy glass prism at a Stourbridge
Fair. Six years later, in 1672, he pub-
lished the results of his experimentation.
With the piece of glass he had refracted
a white light beam and had discovered
that it could be split into seven com-
ponent colors: violet, indigo, blue, green,
yellow, orange and red. Each of these
component colors was refracted or bent
a certain degree as it passed through
the glass. Moreover, Newton found that
a specific color would always be refracted
through a specific angle when passing
through the same prism.
In addition to these refractive laws,
Isaac Newton discovered several laws for
mixing colors. If the light of any two
colors is mixed, the result was a light
intermediate in color between the two.
This rule, and its more recent corollary
that any color could be matched by add-
ing various proportions of three "additive
primaries", have become the basis for
many color applications. Photography,
lithography, and television are the most
common.
Classical Theory Overthrown?
However, this basic work, while cer-
tainly correct, has led to generaliz-
ations which have been shaken thor-
oughly by the experimentation of Edwin
Land, developer of the Polaroid Land
camera. Four years ago, Land took
two black and white transparencies, pic-
turing identical objects, but with slight
variations in grey density and projected
them through individual projectors on the
same screen. In front of one beam he
placed a red filter. In front of the other,
he placed nothing. After the two images
were aligned, Land observed to his
amazement, something the old laws did
not predict. Classical color theory would
dictate that a pink image would be visi-
ble. Instead, he saw a full-color image
containing reds, blues, and yellows. With
this astounding bit of evidence, he went
to work trying to narrow the speculation
on the cause of this phenomenon to a
few basic points.
Before continuing the experiments
themselves, Land set out to search the
literature for some previous experience
of this same observation. Although the
findings were not many, it seems that
several men had seen the same result in
less conclusive form and had therefore
passed it off as "eye fatigue." If only
they had pursued their observations fur-
ther, the problem would probably be
solved today.
The earliest record of anything to this
effect was the observation by Goethe,
the artist, that under red-orange light
conditons, that is, a sceen lit by sunset,
shadows displayed a distinct blue. Later,
in 1774, Benjamin Thompson showed
that these colors were not merely illusions,
but always appeared when a yellow-
orange light and a white light simultan-
eously illuminated a screen. In the earlier
part of the present century, it was found
that three men had discovered and had
patented a technique for color movie
projection by a method equivalent to
those now being investigated. At that
time, however, these contradictions of
Newtonian spectroscopy were passed off
again as "eye fatigue", and experts in
the field of color took no notice.
Closer Look
Let us now look more closely at Dr.
Land's observations and his further ex-
periments. We will not be able to form
any conclusions, however. After centuries
of conviction that a theory was correct,
experts in color are rejecting their old
ideas. But they, and we, cannot take up
a new theory quickly. Only after long
experiments and much discussion can
such conclusions be drawn.
As mentioned previously, Land took

camera shown here. Small rectangles

two black and white transparencies of the
same scene. Each of these is composed
of lighter and darker areas formed by
varying densities of black silver grains on
transparent celluloid. But these two
transparencies are not identical. Upon
careful observation, one will find that
some of the areas in one photograph
appear lighter than the corresponding
areas of the second. Other areas have
the reverse correlation. However, both
have no color. The darker areas merely
serve to block off part of the light trying
to pass through the film.
To systematically determine which of
two identical areas on the two trans-
parencies is to be darker and which
is to be lighter, Land relied on photo-
graphic filters. In the first experiment
he used one red and one green filter.
Anyone familiar with amateur photog-
raphy will recall that if a red filter
is used, all red portions of the scene
will appear white on the black and
white film. If a green filter is used,
the green areas will appear white. Hence
two transparencies of the form desired
for Land's work could be made by the
use of filters.
According to the electromagnetic
theory, red light has a longer wave-
length than green light. Therefore
Land called the transparency exposed
with a red filter before the camera the
long record. Similarly, he called the
other transparency the short record.
Since green filters pass the whole spec-
trum except red, the short record con-
tains an impression of the remaining
colors.
With these two pieces of film, Dr.
Land was able to produce a full color
image. Putting the long record into a
projector, he threw the image onto a
screen with a red filter. On the screen
was a scene in red and black areas. In
another projector he placed the short
record. This was projected with white
light and no filter. The scene appeared
in black and white. Finally, after care-
fully aligning the two images, he ob-
served the same scene, not in shades
of pink as would be expected by old
color ideas, but in full color.
Wondering still if the observations
were merely illusions or "eye fatigue",
Land took photographs of his images.
Since color films are quite faithful in

reproducing reds and whites, he was able
to make an image on film which appeared
in full color to the eye.
More Proof
For more definite proof, he went to
the spectroscope and tried to observe
which wavelengths were present. Because
of the white light from the projector,
all wavelengths were detected even though
there was a prevalence of red wavelengths
due to the red projector.
Many skeptic still doubted that they
were seeing a real full-color image, but
instead thought that the memory was
playing a trick on the eye, telling it that
lemons are always yellow, etc. But in a
clever experiment, Land proved this
could not be. He merely reversed the
long and short records. The result was
a corresponding reversal of the colors:
lips were green and grass was red.
To this point in his work, Edwin
Land had merely investigated work that
had been done previously but which had
been neglected. His experiments served
to reopen the field and to attract atten-
tion to the problem of color perception
by the human eye.
With this much evidence, one might
conclude that the projection of the short
image with white light supplies to the
screen all wavelengths except those of
the red. When the red projection is
added, all colors are theoretically present
and a full color image might somehow
appear.
However, Land made another experi-
ment which made such a conclusion im-
possible. Instead of lighting the short
record with white light, he used a pro-
jector with an orange light. Again he
observed a full color picture.
This was very strange indeed. The
combination of red and orange lights
stimulated the eye to see a full gamut
of color. At this point, Land began to
wonder how close the projector lights
could be in wavelength if the effect was

THE SYNTHETIC
METAL
A Du Pont plastic, known as Delrin, may soon
herald the end of the Age of Metals.
by BENSON P. SHAPIRO, '63E
After thousands of years the Age of
Metals may be coming to a close.
A synthetic substitute for many metals
has finally been discovered and is now
being produced by DuPont, under the
name Delrin, principally for competition
with metals.
Although a synthetic, Delrin resem-
bles a metal in many ways, having a
higher tensile strength and dimensional

stability than many common metals. Its
melting point, 347 °F, is lower than
that of most metals, and it has a crysta-
line structure which resembles that of
the metals.
Chemically Delrin is known as a su-
perpolyoxymethylene. The generic name
for the chemical group to which it be-
longs is acetal resins. Delrin is one of
the many polymers of formaldehyde. Its
molecules usually contain over one thou-
sand nonomeric units of formaldehyde.
Formaldehyde is almost always in the
form of polymers of low molecular
weights (60-300). In fact, when re-
search into formaldehyde was begun,
one of the most difficult problems was
to discover a method of forming and
storing formaldehyde in a reasonably
pure monomeric state.
Accidental Discovery
Formaldehyde polymers, in the form
of resins, were accidentally discovered
by a Russian chemist, Alexander Butle-
rov, about one hundred years ago. The
low molecular weight polymers which
he made were soluble in dilute acids
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


next development in the research into
the chemistry of formaldehyde did not
occur until 1920. In that year, the Ger-
man Nobel prize winner, Staudinger,
polymerized formaldehyde by dissolving
it in ether. The product was unstable,
causing Staudinger to conclude that the
resin was useless.
DuPont entered the picture in 1929
when one of its research chemists, Wal-
lace Carothers, commenced research into
formaldehyde and its allied chemicals.
This research culminated in the discovery
of nylon. Research into the formaldehyde
polymers was then discontinued until
1947. In 1947, a thirty-two year old
research chemist, Archie Barkdoll, started
basic research into monomeric formalde-
hyde for DuPont. Barkdoll's main prob-
lem was to produce and store pure mono-
meric formaldehyde. He accomplished
this most difficult feat by making and
storing the formaldehyde at —19 C. In
June of 1949, Robert N. MacDonald, a
thirty-three year old Ph.D., took over
the project. The research then became
a joint operation of the Polychemicals
and Central Research Departments of
DuPont. The Polychemicals Department
is concerned with production and engi-
neering. Central Research, as the name
implies, is the Research division of Du-
Pont. This combination made it possible
for engineers, applied scientists, and re-
search scientists to pool their knowledge
and experience.
In 1952, DuPont accelerated the Del-
rin research and development program.
The work force was increased to sixty
men, the budget to one million dollars
for six months. Again the researchers
were plagued by problems. Delrin re-
tained the characteristic odor of formal-
dehyde. Stabilization and retension of
color had to be increased. Stabilizing the
plastic also removed the unpleasant odor.
As these and many other problems were
solved, more thought was given to the
problem of marketing the final product.
Delrin received the best market sur-
vey program of any plastic yet developed.
Two-hundred and fifty companies were
asked to evaluate Delrin in five-hundred
different uses. This intensive survey in-
dicated that a fertile field existed for
the formaldehyde polymer.
In order to efficiently administer the
program, which was fast becoming a
marketing project, rather than a research
project, the program's manager had to
be changed. Therefore, in 1956 Jack
Manning, a DuPont salesman, became
product manager.

Thomas Risk of Ford receives a molded blank of Delrin from Jack Manning, head
of the Delrin sales program.
Production
The patent on Delrin was issued on
October 31, 1956. Then things began
to happen fast. In November of 1956
planning for the production plant was
begun. In less than a year money for
the construction of the plant was grant-
ed. The normal pilot plant stage of
production was eliminated since DuPont
was anxious to begin production. A full-
sized plant was scaled up directly from
large size laboratory equipment and ex-
periments. Full-scale production was
scheduled for mid-autumn of 1959. This
production will take place in a fifteen-
million dollar plant at Parksburg, Penn-
sylvania. Initial production is expected
to be in the vicinity of fifteen million
pounds per year.
Delrin will be marketed in the form
of small pellets. It can be injection
molded, blow molded, or extruded. It
can be molded on equipment which is
now in use throughout the plastics in-
dustry. This eliminates the necessity of
making large capital outlays for special
machinery.
It can be extruded in any thickness
and shape. It can also be extruded as
a coating onto paper or fabric.
Delrin may well have a greater im-
pact on the economy of the world than
any other previous plastic. Most plastics
are characterized by an outstanding
property. For example, nylon is impor-
tant as a plastic because of its tensile
strength. In another case, the acrylics,
such as Lucite and Plexiglass, are char-
acterized by their optical properties. In
contrast, Delrin has no true strong point
like the other plastics. Instead, it pos-
sesses a battery of good points, none
of which is outstanding. This variety of
good points makes Delrin a competitor
in many fields, some of which, up to
now, have not felt the impact of the
new synthetics.
Many of Delrin's properties generally
resemble those of the other plastics, but
are better in most respects. It is solvent
resistant, especially to hot or salt water,
which makes it suitable for waterfront
uses. It is a nonconductor of electricity.
Many consumer goods could be among
its uses since it is odorless, tasteless,
and nontoxic.
In other respects Delrin closely re-
sembles the metals. It has high tensile
strength, dimensional stability, and fa-
tigue endurance. It is hard to bend,
and recoils after being bent. Its melting
point is well defined at 347°F. This
means that it is not affected by boiling
water. Like a metal, it is highly crystal-
ine. Its crystallinity can be controlled.
Delrin, as all things, has drawbacks.
It is stained by hot coffee, a situation
which somewhat restricts its use in the
food-processing industry. It is adversely
affected by strong acids and bases. An-
other drawback is the fact that ultra-

HIPPARCHUS
His determination lead him to many discoveries
pertaining to the motion of the Earth, Moon,
and Sun.
by CHARLES MASSER, '62E
Down through the ages history has
given us many people who stand
out from all the rest. Especially in the
realms of science, we find men who
devoted their lives in the search for
truth and understanding of the world
we live in. One such man was Hippar-
chus, a Greek mathematical astronomer
whose search for the truth lead him
to many enlightening discoveries which
are now taken to be common knowl-
edge.
First Appearance
Greek mathematical astronomy made
its appearance in about the sixth or fifth
century B.C. The history of early Greek
astronomy was obtained from the few
pieces of original writings that have
been preserved down through the ages.
Chuck Masser, a native of De-
troit, Michigan, is enrolled in En-
gineering Mechanics at Michigan.
During his four years at Cooley
High School he was a member of
the Astronomy Club, Math Club,
and president of the Science Club.
Chuck's main interest outside
school is amateur astronomy. This
interest is backed up by the fact
he is a member of the Detroit
Astronomical Society, and has
built his own six-inch reflecting
telescope.

Most of all of our knowledge of Hip-
parchus was preserved by the great
Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy. He refers
very frequently to Hipparchus and often
quotes him verbatim. Ptolemy praised
his predecessor very highly, calling him
a man loving his work and loving the
truth.
Hipparchus, whose work can be com-
pared to Newton's for importance, was
born in Bithynia about 190 B.C.
Through his seventy years of life he
advanced the study of mathematical
astronomy more than any other per-
son in history. It is believed that he
was not a student of the Alexandria
School, but during the early part of his
career he visited there several times for
the purpose of observing the heavens.
He did most of his work on the island
of Rhodes where he had built an observ-
atory. Rhodes is an island in the Aegean
Sea off the Southwest coast of Turkey
with an area of 542 square miles.
Mathematics
One important debt that we owe
Hipparchus is his formulation of trig-
onometry. He used this new tool sys-
tematically for astronomical purposes
and for computing a table of chords.
After devising a method of representing
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

Polaris
the heavens in one plane he used his
new invention to divide the heavens
by lines of latitude and longitude using
as reference a circle containing 360 de-
grees.
He then did the same for the in-
habited world dividing it into zones of
latitude and longitude, and using these
co-ordinates systematically established a
position for each locality. For the de-
termination of longitudes he suggested
the observation of eclipses from differ-
ent points; the difference in local times
would give the difference of longitudes.
Precession of Equinoxes
During his lifetime Hipparchus made
large numbers of observations both at
the School of Alexandria and at his
observatory at Rhodes. He collected
these records and catalogued them for
the purpose of helping his successors,
and for comparing them with the work
of previous observers. He collected rec-
ords that went back beyond the Alex-
andria School to the ancient Greeks of
the sixth century B.C. Hipparchus even
had records that went back to the ancient
Babylonian period. One day while he
was comparing his observations with
those of Aristyllus and Timocharis,
whose observations preceded Hipparchus
by about 150 years, he noticed that the
stars were slipping back around the
ecliptic. This could only be explained
by the movement of the equinoxes in
the apparent direction of the stars,
which is east to west. "This is due to
the revolution of the Earth's pole
around the pole of the ecliptic in a
In the Epicycle Theory the small circular
orbit (epicycle), the center of which re-
volves on the circumference of the
larger circular orbit called the deferent.
The Earth is located at the center of the
deferent.

Besides rotating and revolving, the Earth has an oscillating motion like that of a
top slowing down. This is due chiefly to the pull of the moon. Each slow oscillation
takes 26,000 years. Because of this motion the North Pole traces a circle in the
sky, pointing to different stars as it moves in its circuit. Thus 3,000 years ago Alpha
Draconis was the pole star. In 14,000 A.D. Vega will be the pole star and other
constellations will shift accordingly. The southern cross will then be visible
all over this country.
period of 26,000 years in a direction
opposite to that of the Earth's revolu-
tion around the Sun. A consequence is
that the Sun, in its annual journey
around the sky in the ecliptic, returns
to each equinoctial point a little earlier
each year with respect to the stars, so
that the equinoxes occur slightly sooner
than they otherwise would. The move-
ment has thus received the name, pre-
cession of the equinoxes."1
Hipparchus took special notice of the

omy (New York: Chapman and Hill, 1950),

star Spica, the brightest star in the con-
stellation of the Virgin. He noticed
from the observations of Aristyllus and
Timocharis that Spica became further
separated from the autumnal equinox
by an angle of two degrees in 150 years.
This is equivalent to 48 seconds of arc
per year, which is within five per cent
of the correct value of 50.3 seconds of
arc per year.
Star Catalogue
In the year 134 B.C. a bright comet
appeared near the chief star Antares in
the constellation Scorpio. It is believed
with the appearance of this comet Hip-
parchus began to form a catalogue of
stars. By the time it was finished he
had a list of 1080 stars, giving the
celestial latitude and longitude of each
and classifying each star according to
six magnitudes of brightness. It was
during the completion of his catalogue
that Hipparchus noticed that there was
a change in longitude of the stars. Long-
itude is the arc of the ecliptic measured
eastward from the vernal equinox to
the foot of the great circle passing
through the poles of the ecliptic and
the star in question.

BELTS
The recently discovered Van Allen radiation
belts, which circle the earth, may have an im-
portant effect on man's space effort.
by RICHARD KARPINSKI, '62E
Then the door opened. The director
walked in with the packet contain-
ing the data. Men who had been noisily
speculating on the results hushed now.
Had they made a great discovery? Had
the experiment confirmed theory? Or had
it been another failure? Had some small
but vital part got out of adjustment and
thrown off the whole study?
These may have been some of the
thoughts in the mind of scientists at
the State University of Iowa as they re-
ceived the reports from Explorer I, the
first U.S. earth satellite. As the data was
examined they did find that at low alti-
tudes, the radiation reported by the
satellites agreed well with the reports
from other sources. However, at higher
altitudes, radiation seemed to drop off
altogether. From this, the scientists con-
cluded that either they had better begin
looking for reasons or that the instru-
ments had simply failed.
Neither Explanation
Neither explanation seemed very
likely, though; the force required to de-
flect normal cosmic rays from the area
in question would be much greater than
the magnetic force field of the earth
was thought to be, and the instruments
reported normally on repeated lower-al-
titude passes.
Now the first thing a scientist does
when confronted with a problem like
Richard Karpinski, a transfer
from Michigan Tech, is a sopho-
more in Engineering Math. While
at Tech Dick was named to Phi

citey.

this is to get more and more complete
data. The aid of another satellite was
enlisted and Explorer III was put into
orbit with a duplicate set of instruments,
namely a Geiger tube and scaling me-
chanism, temperature and micrometeorite
detectors, and high and low power radio
transmitters, with the addition of a
small tape recorder to fill in the gaps
in the orbit which were not directly
over one of the eleven tracking stations.
The tapes from this new moon only
seemed to verify the reports from the
other. At low altitudes the expected re-
sults were obtained, as altitude increased
sharply until suddenly about a thousand
miles above the surface of the earth
the radiation count fell to nearly zero
and stayed there until the satellite re-
turned to the lower altitudes.
Then came the first break: One of
the men who had recently been work-
ing at calibrating the instruments re-
called the forgotten fact that a Geiger
tube will fail to operate at all under
intense radiation. The reason for this is
that after each pulse the tube registers,
a slight pause is required to rebuild
the potential of the tube. This "dead
time" was on the order of l/10,000th
of a second per impulse for the tubes
used in Explorers I and III. When the
rate of particles exceeds this point, the
tube puts out only a fraction of the
normal signal strength. The scaler could
only use signals of one-eighth normal
strength or more so that beyond the
critical points no values at all would
be recorded. This critical point was cal-
culated at about 35,000 counts per sec-
ond with the above dead time.

22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the conversation, one of the men broke
out with the comment, "Space is radio-
active!", which is rather inaccurate but
illustrative. Now they knew they had
discovered the intense bands of radia-
tion following the earth's magnetic lines
of force that physicists had speculated
on as long as fifty years ago. No one,
however, had predicted the great power
and speed of the particles found.
With the new interpretation of data,
the men could begin to map the Van
Allen radiation belt, as it became known
in honor of one of the scientists at Iowa.
The data from Explorers I and III gave
good contours only for the very bottom
of the high radiation area. Next? More
and better information.
A fourth Explorer went up with a
different payload of instruments, includ-
ing two smaller Geiger rubes, which
were less efficient and scaled down more
to record higher counts and one of which
was shielded with lead to check the
power of particles. The payload also
contained equipment to measure the
total energy received and a selective
counting apparatus to count electrons of
over 65,000 electron volts and protons
of over 10 mev (million electron volts).
Excellent Information
Excellent information provided by
Explorer IV allowed the researchers to
plot the radiation levels up to 1300
miles above the earth and 50 degrees
either side of the magnetic equator.
Toward the poles the belt seemed to
dip into the upper atmosphere perhaps
causing the Northern and Southern
Lights. However, the upper bounds of
the belt were still uncertain and two
general theories were developed: most
of the men at Iowa felt that one band
would describe the situation well, but
one man, Carl Mcllwain, the man who
had offered the solution to the first puz-
zle of the lack of readings in the belt,
held out for the two band theory which
would include an outer banana-shaped
band fully covering a smaller bean-
shaped band both centered over the mag-
netic equator. This theory actually fit the
contours more closely, but now more
and better information was needed.
This time Pioneers I and III carried
equipment to check radiation on their
attempted lunar probes. The reports
from I were spotty but they did show
that the belt or belts extended for thou-
sands of miles upward as expected. Pio-
neer III, however, fell short of the moon
and cut through the area twice, report-
DECEMBER, 1959
ing constantly to the stations on earth.
Not only did it show how far out the
radiation continued but it proved con-
clusively that there were in fact two
well-defined belts, as Mcllwain had pre-
dicted.
The Belts
After all of these reports were an-
alyzed a fair picture of the belts was
obtained including the constituency of
both bands. The outer band seems to be
composed of electrons and protons
trapped from the sun. Their energy is
comparatively low. Hence the band,
which is thousands of miles thick and
has its center some six thousand miles
above the earth, should pose little dif-
ficulty for the space traveler.
The inner band, however, is another
matter. Only 1500 miles up and com-
paratively thin, its particles have ener-
gies in the hundreds of mev and can
penetrate inches of metal. One would
acquire a lethal does of radiation in
about five hours in this zone and the
amount of shielding needed to protect
one would be prohibitive. At the mo-
ment, it seems that one would just have
to either miss the belt completely by-
taking off from polar regions or else
blast through at top speed and endure
it. Neither prospect is very comforting
and taking off from the pole has the
added disadvantage of the fact that
these areas would be dangerous during
solar flare-ups as charged particles are
attracted strongly to the poles.
Dr. Fred Singer of the University of
Maryland has an interesting solution to
this problem. He proposes to put a big,
heavy, metal satellite into orbit within
this belt. Since the particles in question
travel at speeds approaching that of
light, making the pole to pole round
trip in less than two seconds, the belt
should be completely destroyed in a
matter of months.
Whether this could be done depends
in part on the rate of particles joining
the band and where they come from.
Dr. Singer believes the particles come
from atmospheric molecules smashed by
cosmic rays. Electrons and protons from
these collisions would not have the
energies required of the particles in the
belt, but neutrons are also released and
the Singer estimates that one in a mil-
lion of these would decay into high
energy proton-electron pairs which would
then inhabit the belt. Other scientists,
however, say this could only account for
very small fraction of the particles
needed to sustain the belt.

Hints, then facts: the way our scientists
found the radiation belts.
Project Argus
Soon after discovery of the belts some
people began wondering if possibly still
another belt could be created by man.
Consequently Project Argus had been
conceived.
An atomic bomb (fission) was known
to be a good source of the huge quan-
tities of high energy particles that would
be required for such a presumtuous ex-
periment using the whole earth as a

laboratory. Project Argus therefor plan-
ned to explode three small, 1.5 kiloton
bombs in the upper atmosphere. (A 1.5
kiloton bomb has an explosive power
equal to 1500 tons of TNT.)
As the armed forces were in charge
of this experiment, they checked the
possibilities of building such a strong
radiation belt that atomic warheads on
missies would be set off before they got
to the ground. As it turned out, this
would be almost impossible to do, would
be highly unstable, and warheads could
be easily protected from it. However,
the experiment was carried through and
yielded valuable information on the
stability of the natural belts. It also
proved the hypothesis that the Aurora
Borealis and its southern counterpart
Aurora Australis, the Northern and
Southern Lights, were indeed caused by
the radiation belts.
The bombs were exploded on sched-
ule and filled out the whole belt in a
matter of about an hour. The belt
caused by the first bomb was compara-
tively weak. The other two bombs,
though, produced a very strong belt
which lasted for days. The belt pro-
ceded to show itself visibly in both
hemispheres as beautiful displays of
aurora.
The Aurora itself is the "death
march of the particles." It is caused by
the collisions of the high energy par-
ticles that make up the radiation belts
with the gas molecules of the upper at-
mosphere. Each collision slows the par-
ticle down a little until finally it drops
out of the radiation belts entirely. This
explains the variation in auroral activity
with sunspot activity as the belts are at
least in part supplied with particles by
the sun.
Another point of interest is that
Project Argus interfered with radio
communications, blanking them out com-
pletely in some cases. Here, however,
the customary military secrecy prevented
full use of the experiment by failing
to notify radio operators to be on the
lookout for strange phenomena. The in-
formation that was gathered was suffi-
cient to point to a more useful evalua-
tion of the effect of sunspot activity on
radio communications, through the radi-
ation belts, anyway.
So as we cross over the threshold of
the space age the startling discovery of
the belts has answered many questions
but it has also asked many more.

ANOTHER WAY RCA
SERVES DEFENSE
THROUGH
ELECTRONICS

To our missile experts, "is it ready" is al-
most as important as "how far can it go."
For retaliatory power, missile crews must
be able to launch a maximum number of
missiles in rapid fire order.
America's intercontinental ballistic mis-
sile, the Atlas, had already proved itself
for distance on a 5500-nautical-miIe range.
But checkout and launching took several
hours. So the next step in turning the mis-
sile into an operational weapon was to
make it ready for quick action. RCA was
selected to build an electronic system that
would radically reduce the countdown
time at the Atlas Operational Bases now
under construction.
Now, in a matter of minutes, this elabo-
rate electronic system can determine if
any part needs attention—or signals that
the missile will be ready to go.
This automatic checkout equipment
and launch control system for the Atlas is
one more of the many ways in which RCA
Electronics works to strengthen our
national defense.

fice. With job-hunting uppermost in the
minds of seniors and just over the hori-
zon for other engineering students these
facts and the many more included on
the charts become important guideposts,
especially when evaluated in compari-
son to past years. So without becoming
involved in minute details let's examine
some of the important aspects of the
report, how these results compare with
past years, and what we can expect in
the near future.
Important Fact
As mentioned, probably the most im-
portant fact in the "report from 128-
H" is the fact that the average salary
accepted by 238 B.S. candidates last year
was $508 a month. This figure becomes
Table I.—The salaries accepted by Mich-
igan Engineering Graduates according
to the type of program they were in
(1958-1959).
28
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


in 1957-58 and $465 in 1956-57. In
other words, the general upward demand
for engineers that started in the early
fifties is still continuing, and, in fact,
is increasing at an even greater rate.
This last fact is brought out even
more strongly by the fact that in 1957-
58 there were 349 offers for regular em-
ployment while during the past year,
1958-59, there were 702 offers for em-
ployment. This would seem to indicate
that the demand for engineers almost
doubled during the year. It is interesting
to note that while there was a general
increase in offers for grads from all
branches of engineering the big jumps
were in electrical, aero, and mechanical
where the offers jumped from 79 to
206, 62 to 120, and 88 to 164 respec-
tively. Although these figures partially
reflect the country's recovery from the
recession they also indicate that the de-
mand for engineers will continue to in-
crease as our technological development
seeks new and wider horizons.
Two B.S. Degrees?
Turning to another important area
—whether or not to get two B.S. de-
grees—we find that it was generally
more profitable to do so this year than
last with the salaries accepted jumping
to $541. Grads receiving M.S. degrees
also jumped from $563 to $598 while
Pr.D. salaries went from $717 to $821.
Of interest to most engineers is where
they are going to work—geographically
speaking. As expected, Michigan and the
Mid-west get most of the M-grads but
California and the golden sun collared
20% of last year's class. The percentages
for the various locations are shown on
the accompanying chart.
One last note should be of great in-
terest to undergrads who are on the
lookout for summer jobs. Despite ru-
mors to the the contrary the summer job
picture is not rosy, in fact, it is down-
right poor. The fact is that only 21
undergrads received summer jobs through
the placement office. This may be some-
what of a shock since at least that many
are in attendance at most of the group
summer employment "interviews." In
other words, if you want a summer job
you're going to have to dig for it your-
self.
So with these facts and conclusions as
guideposts the Tecbnic wishes the up-
coming grads good luck and . . . happy
hunting.

Automatic systems developed by instrumentation
engineers allow rapid simultaneous recording
of data from many information points.

Frequent informal discussions among analytical
engineers assure continuous exchange of ideas
on related research projects.

Under the close supervision of an engineer,
final adjustments are made on a rig for
testing an advanced liquid metal system.

The field has never been broader
The challenge has never been greater
Engineers at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft today are concerned
with the development of all forms of flight propulsion
systems—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and other advanced
types for propulsion in space. Many of these systems are so
entirely new in concept that their design and development,
and allied research programs, require technical personnel
not previously associated with the development of aircraft
engines. Where the company was once primarily interested
in graduates with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical
engineering, it now also requires men with degrees in
electrical, chemical, and nuclear engineering, and in physics,
chemistry, and metallurgy.
Included in a wide range of engineering activities open to
technically trained graduates at all levels are these four
basic fields:
ANALYTICAL ENGINEERING Men engaged in this
activity are concerned with fundamental investigations in
the fields of science or engineering related to the conception
of new products. They carry out detailed analyses of ad-
vanced flight and space systems and interpret results in
terms of practical design applications. They provide basic
information which is essential in determining the types of
systems that have development potential.
DESIGN ENGINEERING The prime requisite here is an
active interest in the application of aerodynamics, thermo-
dynamics, stress analysis, and principles of machine design
to the creation of new flight propulsion systems. Men en-
gaged in this activity at P&amp;WA establish the specific per-
formance and structural requirements of the new product
and design it as a complete working mechanism.
EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING Here men supervise
and coordinate fabrication, assembly and laboratory testing
of experimental apparatus, system components, and devel-
opment engines. They devise test rigs and laboratory setups,
specify instrumentation and direct execution of the actual
test programs. Responsibility in this phase of the develop-
ment program also includes analysis of test data, reporting
of results and recommendations for future effort.
MATERIALS ENGINEERING Men active in this field
at P&amp;WA investigate metals, alloys and other materials
under various environmental conditions to determine their
usefulness as applied to advanced flight propulsion systems.
They devise material testing methods and design special
test equipment. They are also responsible for the determina-
tion of new fabrication techniques and causes of failures or
manufacturing difficulties.

Automatic Transistor
Production
Scientists at the Westinghouse re-
search laboratories have taken a major
step toward the fast, continuous, com-
pletely automatic manufacture of tran-
sistors and related semiconductor de-
vices.
Dr. S. W. Herwald, Westinghouse
vice-president, research, disclosed that
Westinghouse scientists have constructed
long ribbons of semiconductor devices
by forming them along the surface of
long, thin crystals of germanium about
1/8 inch wide and a few thousandths of
an inch thick. Such construction appears
to make feasible the automatic produc-
tion of transistors and other solid-state
devices directly by machine.
"These devices demonstrated the ulti-
mate usefulness of a revolutionary new
method for growing germanium which
was recently discovered in our labora-
tories," Dr. Herwald said. "This tech-
nique grows the germanium as thin, flat
continuous strips, or dendrites—the exact
form in which it can be used directly
in finished semiconductor devices."
Conventionally, germanium is grown
as a thick, round ingot that requires
costly, time-consuming processing before
useful devices can be produced from it.
In contrast, such devices can be con-
structed directly on the smooth, mirror-
like surfaces of germanium dendrites
exactly as the material is grown.
The development of working devices
from dendrites is being carried out un-
der a $2 million "molecular electronics"
contract recently awarded to Westing-
house by the U. S. Air Force's Air Re-
search and Development Command, Dr.
Herwald reported.
Carried through to the development
of over-all systems, the molecular elec-
tronics concept could drastically reduce
the size, weight, and power consump-
tion of space-age electronic systems. This
concept involves a new understanding
of the basic nature and capabilities of
materials and a new approach—on a
molecular and atomic scale—to the con-
ception, design, and development of
materials that exhibit these capabilities.

An electronic instrument has been de-
veloped for clinical use in the recording
and analysis of movements of the pupil
of the eye. The measurement of these
pupillary changes provides valuable in-
formation about the condition of the
brain stem. Earlier instruments have in-
volved complex, time-consuming opera-
tions, making them unsuitable for clin-
ical applications.
N. S. Savannah
The nuclear "heart" of the N.S.
Savannah was laid open pictorially by
two television cameras while it generated
energy for the world's first atom-pow-
ered merchant ship.
Passengers in the ship's main lounge
were able to see, via television cameras.
a nuclear reactor working at its mighty-
task of producing steam for the Savan-
nah's conventional turbines. The pulse
or "heart beat" of the reactor also was
relayed over an accompanying audio
hookup.
The 21,000-ton vessel, christened July
21, 1959, by Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhow-
er at the Camden, N. J., yards of the
New York Shipbuilding Corporation, is
designed to run 3 years, or 300,000
miles, without refueling. The vessel was
proposed originally by President Eisen-
hower as a demonstration of "peacetime
use of atomic energy, harnessed for the
improvement of human living."
The reactor is housed in a "contain-
ment vessel" below decks, an area not
open to the 60 passengers the ship ac-
commodates. However, television cam-
eras were mounted so they could be
"panned" to provide a complete view
of the reactor compartment.
By means of a switching system in
the ship's control center, the television
picture of the propulsion unit was trans-
mitted over a closed circuit to a 6-by-8-
foot television projection screen in the
lounge. The cables leading to the cam-
eras were installed through the cham-
ber wall with a special "potting" proc-
ess to prevent any radioactivity from
seeping out from the containment vessel.
It was disclosed that two radiotele-
phone units were to be installed on the
S.nannah to enable passengers to make
ship-to-shore calls. The radio system also
will supply an added safety factor and

As an additional feature, the Savan-
nah's closed-circuit television system will
provide entertainment for passengers and
crew. Motion-picture films and other
program material will be fed to television
receivers in the main lounge, the ship's
bar, officers' lounge, and crew's lounge.
Moreover, provision is also made for
equipping 37 staterooms with television
sets.
Motion pictures can be transmitted
to the large main lounge screen as well
and, when the Savannah is close enough
to land, standard entertainment television
broadcasts can be picked out of the air.
Except for its atomic power supply,
which replaces the customary fuel and
boilers, the Savannah is very much like
any modern merchant ship.

IBM scientist Gerald Burns
studies ferroelectrics
to improve understanding
of their basic properties.

A basic research project
"I'm using nuclear resonance to explore ferro-
electrics," says IBM scientist Gerald Burns.
"We're trying to discover how the ions in a ferro-
electric crystal are arranged, and why and how
they change position and structure with tempera-
ture changes. Ferroelectric crystals have a revers-
ible spontaneous polarization . . . that is, they can
be polarized in either of two directions, and, by
the application of an electric field, polarization can
be reversed."
How did Gerry Burns come to work on this prob-
lem? "I started this particular research project be-
cause it was related to other work I had been doing
and I felt it would prove challenging and reward-
ing. Little is known about what goes on in a ferro-
electric crystal—or why. Our basic objectives are
to find out what and why.
"At the planning stage, the project seemed to offer
a great research potential, but none of us was
sure how long the project might last or what its
ramifications might eventually be. It's a good ex-
ample of the basic research done at IBM."

A day at the laboratory
One of the eight scientists in the Ferroelectric Re-
search Group, 26-year-old Gerald Burns began a
recent day by setting up equipment for the first
daily run.
"The experiment is conceptually quite simple," he
explained. "A ferroelectric crystal is placed in the
tank circuit of an oscillator, between the pole
pieces of a large electromagnet. The sample is sur-
rounded by a dewar so that the temperature can be
accurately regulated. Then the magnetic field is
slowly decreased. When the field reaches certain
values, the nuclei in the crystal absorb energy from
the oscillator. The trick is to detect this absorption
which is quite small. Runs at various temperatures
are made, and the temperature dependence of this
absorption is studied.
After setting up the first run, Gerry Burns met
with the head of his group. Together, they dis-
cussed the temperature dependence of the nuclear
quadrupole resonance coupling constants. Several
helpful suggestions were made.
Gerry Burns then talked with chemists who grow
the crystals used in the experiments. They dis-
cussed possible variations in the crystal-growing
method and considered the growth of other crys-
tals in order to broaden the experiments.
Early in the afternoon, he attended a seminar con-
ducted by a visiting professor on the subject of
the atomic structure of solids. Each week, several
such seminars on a variety of technical matters
are given.
After the seminar, Gerry Burns returned to set up
another run at a different temperature. He also
talked to a technician about building a new piece
of equipment to be used in future experiments.
36
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Excellent facilities and programs
"Besides these experiments, I'm also doing some
theoretical calculations in the field of nuclear
quadrupole resonance. The actual computations
were done here at the Laboratory on an IBM 704,
which can perform in minutes computations which
would take weeks if done by other methods.
"This is one of the advantages of working at IBM.
Large-scale high-speed computers are available to
research scientists when needed. Furthermore you
will find your colleagues always willing to help
when you are stumped by a problem. Many of
these men are recognized authorities in their
fields. The exchange is always informative and
often stimulates new ideas and approaches.
"Our Company offers many educational opportu-
nities—both in general education and for ad-
vanced degrees," Gerry Burns said. "As an exam-
ple, engineers and scientists may earn a Master's
Degree in a post-graduate program conducted by
Syracuse University right here in Poughkeepsie.
"We also have a very useful library. Just the other
day I dropped in to pick up some technical papers
I needed as source material for an article. I've al-
ready published one paper on my experiments,"
he noted. "You're encouraged to publish your
findings and to participate in professional society
meetings. It's important for a research man to
work in an atmosphere where independent think-
ing is encouraged and where every effort is made
to facilitate research investigations."

Ford Grant
The University of Michigan has been
granted $1,175,000 by the Ford Foun-
dation as one of the first of the new
Foundation grants in science and engi-
neering.
Henry T. Heald, Foundation presi-
dent, announced the program in an
address in Washington, D.C., before the
annual meeting of the American In-
stitute of Consulting Engineers.
The U-M will use the grant for two
new projects.
The major share, $900,000, will be
used to support a U-M experimental
program leading to the wide-spread use
of high-speed computers in engineering
education. While the U-M will direct
this program, a number of faculty mem-
bers of other institutions will be in-
vited to participate.
The remainder, S275.000, is to be
used to strengthen engineering education
by recruiting and maintaining promising
faculty members. The money is to be
used to financially help outstanding doc-
toral candidates who intend to teach en-
gineering to attain their degrees faster,
and to further development of present
faculty members.
Acknowledging the grant, Dean S. S.
Attwood, of the U-M College of En-
ginering said, "We are pleased and ap-
preciative of the Ford Foundation grant
that will enable us to advance the qual-
ity of engineering education, both lo-
cally and in cooperating institutions.
"Certain features of the grant will
attract more young engineers into teach-
ing and speed up their acquisition of
doctoral degrees.
"The grant also introduces students
early in their training to the use of
electronic computers, which will permit
them to study and solve more complex
problems than in the past, and to in-
troduce computer techniques upon grad-
uation into many industrial operations.
Both engineering education and indus-
try will profit."
Details of the computer education
portion of the grant were listed by
Prof. Donald L Kati, chairman of the
Department of Chemical and Metallur-
gical Engineering and chairman of the
Computer Committee of the College of
Engineering.
The aim of the U-M program, Prof.
Katz said, is to ensure that all future
engineering graduates have an acquain-
tance with the use of computers in en-
gineering calculations, just as they have
with other engineering practices.
The Ford grant will help the Uni-
versity to show the way to introducing
engineering students to the use of com-
puters in regular courses early in their
training, probably during their sopho-
more year.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


"This campus is one of the few in
the world which embraces professional
groups in practically all areas related
to space technology."
In outlining the faculty strengthening
portion of the grant, the Ford Founda-
tion pointed out that "these years are
particularly crucial to the future of en-
gineering education. The urgent needs
are to add greater scientific and math-
ematical emphasis to the undergraduate
curricula and to increase the number of
students preparing for engineering ca-
reers at all levels. Thus, the recruitment,
preparation and retention of highly
qualified faculty personnel is the fore-
most problem of engineering education."
Fallout Food
University of Michigan scientists are
making the nation's first long-term
study of the effect of radioactive fallout
on man's food supply.
In cooperation with the Argonne
Laboratories and seven agricultural ex-
periment stations across the country, they
are trying to draw a "base line" for
measuring the slow rise in radiological
levels in grain and other crops.
Prof. A. Geoffrey Norman of the
U-M Department of Botany reports that
to date only a "fantastically small"
amount of radiation has worked its way
into the nation's farm crops. Although

New Assistant Dean of the Engineering
School is Dean Arlen R. Hellwarth. He
graduated from the University in 1925
and taught in the Electrical Engineer-
ing department from 1930 to 1933.
Space Aims
University of Michigan work bearing
on space explorations was outlined by
Prof. Wilbur C. Nelson, chairman of
the U-M's Department of Aeronautical
and Astronautical Engineering.
He spoke before the Seventh Trien-
nial Medical Alumni Conference here.
He said that various U-M units are
presently pursuing these projects:
1. Research in nuclear propulsion
and nuclear power generation.
2. Research leading to the instrumen-
tation of a satellite observatory.
3. Initial work leading to meteorolog-
ical satellite instrumentation.
4. Research and development (R
and D) work leading to the instrumen-
tation of a lunar probe for the measure-
ment of lunar atmospheric pressure.
5. Design and development of a 5-
tage, 1,000-mile-altitude sounding rocket
to measure electron density in the
atmosphere.
6. "R and D" work in inertial navi-
gation and long-range radar tracking
and communication.
7. Sponsorship of several extensive
Space Technology Seminars in the new
U-M Institute of Science and Technol-
ogy, under Dr. Robert R. White. These
are to bring leading authorities to Ann
Arbor for lectures and consultation be-
ginning this month.
As for the future, Professor Nelson
said he could say with certainty only
that "the University will become more
deeply engrossed in this fascinating and
vast field of work as time goes on.
"One can certainly predict an increas-
ing interplay between the engineers, the
physical scientists, the life scientists, and
the School of Medicine as our space
program develops.
The new Assistant Dean and Secre-
tary of the College of Engineering is
not a stranger to the University of Mich-
igan. Dean Arlen R. Hellwarth gradu-
ated from the University in 1925 with
a Bachelor of Science in Electrical En-
gineering and a Master of Science in
Mathematics in 1936. During his stu-
dent days he became affiliated with Phi
Kappa Tau and Tau Beta Pi. He taught
in the Electrical Engineering Department
from 1930 to 1933.
Dean Hellwarth left the position of
Assistant to the Director of Employ-
ment at the Detroit Edison in February
1959 after twenty-five years service.
The Assistant Dean sees a need for
greater class spirit and more pride for
the College of Engineering among the
engineering students. He also stresses
the importance of faculty counseling
services for all the students in engineer-
ing throughout their stay at the campus.
Dean Hellwarth points out that invalu-
able help is available from the faculty,
b:yond that provided in the classroom,
if the student will seek it. He hopes,
with student interest and assistance, to
develop opportunities that will help pre-
pare students for their early introduction
to their chosen profession of engineer-
ing.

by RANDOLPH ROGERS, '57J
he scientific world was startled last
week upon disclosure of the discovery
in nature of the last remaining undis-
covered natural element, finally complet-
ing the periodic table.
Natural technetium, atomic number
43, was discovered by a commune of
worker-physicists lead by Prof. Nikolai
Borschtkin of the Akademie Sovietska
Fiz/ki in Novosibrsk, USSR. Heretofore,
technetium had been made only by the
bombardment of molybdenum with pro-
tons accelerated by a cyclotron.
The extent and purity of the Russian
technetium deposits were not revealed
in the Russian radio broadcast announc-
ing the discovery, which was monitored
by the BBC in London.
The Russians have reported at length
on the chemical and mechanical prop-
erties of this new element, whose exist-
ence in nature was previously considered
very doubtful.
Chemically, technetium (symbol Tc,
at. no. 43) occurs virtually 100% in the
isotope with atomic weight 99. It occu-
pies a place in the electromotive series
below lead, and has valences of six and
seven. It is found in the native state,
as the trioxide TcA3, and as the sulfide,
TcS:1. Refining of the native ore is done
mechanically; of the oxide by reducing
with hydrogen or carbon monoxide; of
the sulfide by roasting followed by re-
duction.
Like most of the rare earth metals,
technetium does not form carbonates.
Being a group VIIB element like man-
ganese, it shares many chemical proper-
ties with this metal It forms the weak
pertechnetic acid, HTc04, and the
strongly oxidizing compound KTcO,,,
corresponding to potassium permanga-
nete. Technetium does not have a strong
affinity for the halogens, and while it
forms many intermetallic compounds,
the salts and the oxide are not stable.
Many of the compounds exhibit a pink
color, and the borax bead is pink.
Many uses have been proposed for the
chemical compounds of the new ele-
ment. HTc04 presents interesting pos-
sibilities as an oxidizing agent for solid-
propellant rockets, as it is very easy and
cheap to prepare and handle, and de-
composes at a very regular rate. An
aqueous solution of the chloride or bro-
mide is pressure-sensitive, and will
change color from clear to pale pink to
scarlet as the barometric pressure drops
from 31 to 28 inches of mercury. Small
quantities of the nitrate, chlorate, or
phosphate added to a hydroponics tank
apparently will increase the growth rate
by 20 to 30 percent, and create a high
degree of mutations. Certain organic re-
actions, particularly those encountered in
the synthesis of antibiotics, are catalyzed
very effectively by the metal, its carbide
(Tc4C7) and the intermetallic compound
with vanadium, TcV„.
The properties of the unalloyed metal
are far from spectacular. Crystallizing in
the hexagonal close-packed system, the
metal is dense, soft, and has a very
low elastic modulus. Surprisingly, the
metal behaves as though brittle under
impact loads. A specmen which stretch-
es like rubber when pulled slowly frac-
tures into splinters like glass when
jerked or hammered.
The principal reason for excitement
in metallurgical circles over the new
element is that it forms a hard eutectic-
type intermetallic compound with alu-
minum. This compound, Al,Tc, serves
the same function in aluminum that iron
carbide does in steel. It raises the hard-
ness of the metal when it is present even
in small quantities. Thus a new alloy
containing about 2 percent Al,Tc is to
aluminum what tool steel is to soft fer-
ritic iron.

to be maintained. In his research shop
he had built what he called a dual image-
illuminating monochromator. With it he
was able to project the long and short
records simultaneously selecting for the
two projecting lights any wavelengths in
the entire visible spectrum.
Using this apparatus, it was found the
eye could recieate the full range of colors
with any two wavelengths in the spectrum
just so that the two were sufficiently far
apart. Moreover, he found that the sep-
aration varied throughout the spectrum
and in some regions could be only three
percent of the total visible variations in
color. Hence, two yellow lights could be
used to achieve the proper effect.
Another unusual observation was that
correct color reproduction did not al-
ways occur when the long recoid was
illuminated by the longer wavelength
and visa versa. In the blue region, the
proper relationship among the colors
occurred only when the long image was
projected with the shorter wavelength.
Using the dual monochromator. Land
was able to develop a chart for pre-
dicting the color produced by any pair
of records. The technique used to do
this is too complex for discussion here,
but the very fact that such a procedure
can be carried out shows the appar-
ent reliability of the observations.
Eye Detection of Color
How then, does the eye detect color?
Land's work seems to point that it is
not through detection of specific wave-
lengths. What means is used instead of
this classical theory is open to broad
speculation.
Two further experiments seems to
suggest a possible theory. Throughout
the work it appeared that there must
be a certain degree color of rendomness
in the presence of colors for a full color
image to be observed. For example, one
could not obtain a solid blue image from
the method if blue was not one of the
illuminating lights. To further test this
idea, a "wedge" filter was placed in
the red projector. The image showed a


Projector for use with the photographs taken with the dual color camera. The filter
in front of the long record is red and there is no filter for the short record.
red area on one side and gradually
faded into a dark area on the other. In
the white projector, another wedge fil-
ter was placed with gradient perpendic-
ular to the wedge in the red projector.
The top of the image was white and
the bottom black. Over the image area,
with both lamps turned on, the entire
range of red and white ratios was
achieved including every one possible
in a full colored image. However in
this case, the ratios were in a strictly
ordered arrangement. Hence there was
no randomness and no color—only a
graded pink wash.
The second experiment involves two
colored images. Although Land used two
special viewers, the result is analogous
to using two dual monochromators. One
image was projected using one pair of
wavelengths; another, with the identical
scene, was projected on an adjacent
screen using a separate pair of wave-
lengths. Both images were visible at the
same time, yet the color in each was
derived from a different pair of wave-
lengths. Hence each is a separate color
world passing on color information in
some yet unknown way to the eye.
Apparently, Land claims, the eye per-
ceives color by comparing longer and
shorter wavelengths. Somewhere in the
visible spectrum is a fulcrum on one
side of which all wavelengths are short
and on the other side long. Experiments
show that in the ordinary sunlit world,
there is such a fulcrum. Land believes
that this fulcrum is automatically de-
termined by the eye in each separate
color world and that it is used to de-
termine the ratios used for color per-
ception in that color world.
How the eye goes about doing this
is still unclear. Land speculates that
many wavelengths are filtered in the eye
and each forms a separate image on the
retina. The brain then determines the
fulcrum wavelength, averages together
all the wavelengths on the long side of
the fulcrum and all those on the short
side, and finally compares the two av-
erages. The ratio of these averages de-
termines what color is perceived.
One thing must be made clear. Land
does not propose a two-color theory of
light. His experiments show that clas-
sical three color theory of perception
does not predict the observed results in
his work. He has demonstrated that the
eye can operate quite well with two
packages of information and that three
colors are not needed for the percep-
tion of the entire visible spectrum. He
has proposed a theory of color percep-
tion which he believes explains his ob-
servations. Nevertheless, before any con-
clusions are drawn, there are many
questions to be answrered; but one thing
is certain. The method of color per-
ception used by the eye is exceedingly
complex and surprisingly unknown.

violet rays discolor it. Also it is not
flameproof, although it does burn slowly.
Delrin will create fierce competition
for metal castings. The metals which
will be especially vulnerable to this com-
petition are aluminum and zinc in the
form of castings. These metals are pres-
ently used quite widely in the automo-
bile industry. DuPont expects to have
two pounds of Delrin in each auto pro-
duced in the near future. Considering
the tremendous volume of automobile
production, this will amount to a very
sizable market for Delrin, if DuPont
can realize their goal.
Since it is resistant to many normal
solvents, and since it has a compara-
tively high melting point, it will prob-
ably be used to a large extent in the
food-processing industry. In fact, Union
Chain and Manufacturing Company of
Sandusky, Ohio is planning to replace
much of the stainless steel in their food
and brewery processing conveyors with
Delrin.
Zebco of Oklahoma, the world's
largest manufacturer of closed-face fish-
ing reels is planning to take advantage
of Delrin's resistance to salt water by
using it in reels.
Because of its strength, Delrin may
very well find application as gears and
pump impellers.
Costs Not High
At first glance, Delrin appears so ex-
pensive as to make it almost useless
from an economic viewpoint, but upon
scrutiny one begins to realize that it
is actually quite inexpensive. At the on-
set of production, Delrin will cost in
the vicinity of ninety-five cents per
pound, three to seven times higher than

copper, zinc or aluminum. But, the dif-
ference in density between a metal and
Delrin means that a weight-unit of
Delrin will occupy much more volume
than the same weight of a metal. Also
the cost of molding and finishing op-
erations must be considered. The mold-
ing cost of Delrin and the casting cost
of most metals are about equal, but,
when Delrin comes out of the mold, it
is almost a finished product, whereas, a
metal casting must go through many
expensive finishing operations. In addi-
tion, the plastic scrap can easily be re-
melted and remolded.
The general price trend of metals
has been up, whereas that of plastics
has been down. Every plastic now sells
at a lower price than when it was intro-
duced, because larger capacity, and new
processing methods have combined to
result in more efficient production. Del-
rin is far from expensive now, and if
it follows the trend established by other
plastics, it will be much cheaper than
many metals.
It will also find many uses which
will utilize those properties in which
it is more like a plastic than a metal.
These include its electrical properties, and
the fact that it is not toxic.
DuPont is taking a chance by intro-
ducing a plastic which may provide
competition for one of its present prod-
ucts. Nylon is presently being used in
gears and in a few other applications
which are also among the many uses
of Delrin. But, DuPont feels that if
their brand of nylon, Zytel, is to be
replaced by another product, it is best
that it be a product of DuPont rather
than of one of its competitors. Also,
DuPont may be contemplating produc-

This would utilize the good points of
both. As far as sales go, this combina-
tion would supplement the sales of
both.
Delrin will most probably have a
greater effect on our economy than any
other synthetic produced until now. Its
variety of properties and applications in-
dicate that it will cause great changes
in our economy. Its chemical novelty in-
dicates that it may very well be the first
in a long series of similar synthetics.

for the new alloy containing 98 percent
aluminum and 2 percent aluminum tech-
netide are amazing, and will open
doors for aluminum such as the Bes-
semer process did for iron. It has a
tensile strength of 80,000psi. in the
annealed condition and a tensile strength
of 280,OOOpsi. when water quenched.
It may be quenched as rapidly as de-

in hardness, strength, lightness, conduc-
tivity, and corrosion resistance it will
undoubtedly revolutionize the world's

In this new version of draw poker,

poker hands from the cards; that is, the
first player selects five cards for his hand,
then the second selects his hand, and so
forth. After this, each player in turn
is given the opportunity to draw up to
five new cards, or to stand pat. Then
the player with the highest hand wins.
However, since the suits are all equal,
two royal flushes will always tie.
Assuming that the discards are set
aside out of the game during each
hand, what combinations of cards may
the first player draw with complete as-
surance of winning with a pat hand?

water for the platoon, but had not been gone long when he
came running back to the camp emptyhanded and panting.
"Sir," he explained, "there's a big alligator in the stream,
and I'm afraid to get the water."
"Don't worry, son," said the sympathetic officer. "That
alligator is probably four times as scared of you as you are
of him."
"Well, sir," replied the cadet, "if that alligator's only
half as scared as I am, that water ain't fit to drink."

Further Measurements
Hipparchus continued his research by
measuring the "Obliquity of the Eclip-
tic." which is the angle between the plane
of the Earth's orbit and that of the Earth's
equator (see plate I). He arrived at the
same result as Eratosthenes, which was
approximately 23 degrees and 27 min-
utes. Hipparchus continued to make
comparisons with the observations of
Aristarchus. He found that the tropical
year, which is the time enclosed by
two successive passages of the Sun
through the Vernal Equinox, was several
minutes too long from the accepted
value of 3654 days. Hipparchus made
a correction on the Tropical Year by
subtracting seven minutes from Aristar-
chus's value. This value was still four
minutes too long, but much of the error
was due to the uncertainty of Hippar-
chus's observations.
After correcting the length of the
year Hipparchus made observations on
the length of the seasons. He found
that the Sun took 186y2 days to travel
from the vernal equinox to the au-
tumnal equinox while it took only
178% days to travel from the autumnal
equinox to the next vernal equinox.
He observed the Moon and found its
orbit to have an inclination of five de-
grees to the ecliptic. He also tried to
find the size of the moon and its dis-
tance from the Earth by using an eclipse

method. He observed the angular diam-
eter of the Earth's shadow on the Moon,
and by comparing this with known an-
gular diameters of the Sun and Moon
he could calculate a proportion between
the distances of the Sun and Moon. He
calculated the distance to the Moon as
almost 59 times the Earth's radius, and
comparing this result to Aristarchus's
theory that the Sun was 19 times further
away than the Moon, Hipparchus con-
cluded that the distance to the Sun was
1,100 times the Earth's radius. This
value, however, is twenty times too
short; the true distance to the Sun is
23,400 times the Earth's radius. As
for the diameter of the Moon, Hippar-
chus found it to be a quarter of the
diameter of the Earth, which has a
diameter of 8,000 miles.
Hipparchus was also an inventor, and
his greatest achievement in this field
was an instrument used for observation-
al astronomy that could find the latitude
and longitude of any celestial body rela-
tive to another body for which the co-
ordinates are known.
Motion of Solar System
Before the time of Hipparchus many
theories were evolved about the motion
of the heavenly bodies. Appolonius of
Perga, who lived from about 250 B.C.
to 200 B.C. suggested that the motion
of the heavenly bodies could be ex-
In the Eccentric Theory point A revolves
around the Earth, and this distance from
the Earth is small.The planet or Sun is
revolving around point A.
plained easier by a combination of cir-
cular motions than by the complicated
theory of the revolving spheres of
Eudoxus. Hipparchus then studied the
movements of the stars and planets and
set forth two theories of circular mo-
tion, that of "eccentrics" and that of
"epicycles." Many of his fellow scien-
ces felt that the theory of the epicycles
was superior to the theory of eccen-
trics. The epicycle theory can easily be
explained. Each heavenly body is said
to move uniformly on a small circular
orbit called an epicycle. The center of
this epicycle then moves uniformly on
a larger circular orbit called the de-
ferent. The Earth is located at the cen-
ter of the deferent. In the theory of the
eccentrics the situation is different For
example, let us look at the Sun. In this
theory the center of the circular orbit
on which the Sun travels moves in a
circular orbit around the Earth, and the
distance to the Earth of this point re-
volving around the Earth is small. Hip-
parchus finally used both of these theo-
ries ,n forming another theory. He was
able with great success to apply his
theory to the movement of the Sun and
Moon, but he could not apply it to the
movement of the planets largely because
of the inadequate numbers of observa-
tions. The charts and tables that Hip-
parchus constructed for the Sun and
Moon, however, enabled his successors
to predict the times of a Moon eclipse
within an hour or two, and eclipses of
the Sun somewhat less accurately. How-
ever, these predictions were much more
accurate than ever before possible.
These are many of the achievements
of Hipparchus, one of the greatest as-
tronomers that ever lived. Throughout
his life he was searching for answers
that would give him a better under-
standing of how our universe ticks. Not
only did his work help him in under-
standing but also helped his successor
to uncover answers to many new and
old problems.

One of the more important features
of the carrier will be almost unlimited
steaming endurance at high speed. Op-
erational flexibility will be increased also
as a result of this capability since high

proved and replenishment requirements
greatly reduced.
The aviation fuel supply will be al-
most double that of the USS Forrestal,
and an additional 4000 square feet of
flight deck space will permit operation
of additional and larger aircraft. The
carrier will be able to operate more effi-

Engineering Mechanics
Rapid technological developments have brought about an increasing need for engineers exceptionally
well-trained in the basic sciences The need is acute throughout industry and government as well as in
institutions of research and in universities; to help fill this neeed is the purpose of the program in Engi-
neering Mechanics.
Men with training in the field of Engineering Mechanics are sought by companies and institutions of
all kinds, particularly by those working on modern developments. Most young men in the field are engaged
in highly technical work, but many, like other engineers, enter supervision and management.
The major areas of study in the bachelors program are strength of materials, elasticity, plasticity,
dynamics, vibrations, fluid mechancis, and thermo-dynamics. The Department has small but modern labo-
ratories and adequate computer and research facilities. The association of theory with the physical aspects
of the work is very close.
The photograph shows a modern testing machine being prepared for a test. The instructor and student
are adjusting a displacement transducer. The machine is fully instrumented and records stress strain curves
for materials varying from steel to nylon threads. It is capable of automatically cycling the load or stress
between prescribed limits.

only a single word is spoken, "epinephrine."
The syringe is firmly placed in the surgeon's

In the human body epinephrine is secreted

DOW is tomorrow-minded
plant
Take just one for-instance: Plaquemine. Some five
hundred acres of Louisiana sugar cane country once.
Stately oaks and magnolias. Today they're still
there. But growing harmoniously with them are the
vivid contemporary colors of the new plant—the
Dow reds and greens, gleaming whites, Confederate
gray, businesslike black. They blend in with the
oaks and magnolias to provide one of America's
most modern and distinctive plant vistas. Along
with the forward-looking products and the people
who produce them, this tomorrow-minded Dow
plant is a part of the new face of the new South.
Plaquemine is located in one of the nation's fastest-
growing concentrations of chemical manufacture.
This now bustling Evangeline country offers abun-
dant natural resources, an excellent network of
transportation, good accessibility to great and
developing markets and communities. And, perhaps
most important of all—Old Man River—the limit-
less Mississippi, with its never-ending source of
fresh water and its gate to the ocean-going trade
routes of the world.
Today's Plaquemine is a symbol of Dow's tomorrow-
minded growth—at one of the fastest rates in the
industry. To keep pace with its output of products,
new and old, Dow plants are building nationwide.
Says the Chairman of the Board of Directors: "We
build in boom times to keep up with the demand;
we build in slump times for the future." And Dow
continues to build its plants, products and people
always with tomorrow in mind.

In Closing
It is gratifying to sit back after four and a half years at this University and
observe the changes that have taken place. The physical appearance of the
campus hasn't changed so much—oh yes, the UGL has replaced the old Auto-
motive Labs, north campus increased in size, and twenty acres of cement sud-
denly found a home—the real change has occured in the students. People
whom I knew as shy freshmen, are now intimate friends and leaders in their
respective groups. Most of these friends, about whom I am talking, are in
student activities which points rather obviously at the value of activities.
Student activities have a two fold purpose; one is the service to the college
community, and the other is the benefit to the student participant. Service is
not the prime importance right now; it is there, easily obtainable, although in
many cases, quite debatable. The first order of importance is the benefit that
the activities offer to its student members. Opportunities in leadership, creative-
ness, and association are given to students. It is often quite amusing to watch
these students accept these challenges with both anticipation and apprehension,
mature with their new duties, and finally become indignant to suggested
assistance. Student activities build confidence, leadership ability, skill, and
harmony. In short, they give the necessary things that round out and complete
a college education.
As this is the last opportunity I shall have to express my opinions, (the
Technic will have a new editor in February) I wish to put a plug in for the
Technic. The time I have given to the Technic has been immense, but it has
been worth every minute of it. Gratifying to say the least, pleasurable to
describe the work, rewarding in character as to the climax—these all describe
my feelings for the Technic. My recommendation to student engineers is to
get into student activities so that you may benefit from the wonderful oppor-
tunities they afford.
In closing, I would like to give my appreciation and thanks to the Technic
Staff, who have worked very hard; to the faculty advisors, Professors W. Earl
Britton, Melville Stout, Richard Schneidewind, and Robert Weeks who have
lent their excellent guidance over the last few years; and last, but not least,
to you, the students of the college of Engineering, for your kind support.

MEDICINE
Mechanically man has nearly conquered space.
Now the question is — will physicological and
psychological factors limit man's flight into
space?
by SUSAN OTT, '61E
Dummys, such as the one shown
here, have made possible great
advances in space medicine. They
have been used to test pressure
suits, rocket sleds, gravitational
and acceleration forces, as well as
a variety of other factors future
astronauts will have to face.
Since late 1957, the United States has
been frenziedly pushing its man-in-
space program. While rocket compon-
entry and fuel development have been
acknowledged for some years, little im-
portance was attached to the field of space
medicine until rather recently. No matter
how perfect the space vehicle, if man
cannot survive the rigors of swift flight
away from earth, there can be no man
in space—at least, not a living one.
As it happens, space doctors are more
nearly ready to send a man into orbit
than those engaged in the logistics of the
project. This is reasonable. Doctors lay
down the requirements for the preserva-
tion of human life in space; it falls to
the engineer to adhere to these require-
ments, to make them physically possible
and, when everything is installed and
functioning, to get the whole thing off
the ground.
Three Major Aspects
The considerations of the space doctor
fall roughly into three large categories:
the physiological aspect, the psychological
aspect, and the methods of taking data.
Researchers find that the main points of
the physiological facet are these:
1. Acceleration, noise, erratic motion
of takeoff and re-entry
2. Weightlessness
3. Ionizing radiation, energetic
particles
4. Hypobaria (low pressure)
5. Oxygen supply
6. Food-waste cycle
7. Temperature extremes
The ability of the pilot to withstand
the force without injury and the effi-
cient use of the rocket power are two
considerations that will govern the
amount of acceleration experienced dur-
ing launching and re-entry into the at-
mosphere. It may be possible for the
pilot himself to increase or decrease the
acceleration at these times, as he is dis-
posed.
The optimum position for withstand-
ing high acceleration forces, according to
experimentation with accelerations of 10-
18g, is that the back be inclined at 20-25
degrees from the horizontal (assuming
that the forces act vertically), the thighs
be vertical and the lower legs be inclined
at 5 degrees from the horizontal. Since
the force is distributed along ihe back,
the strain on the cardiovascular system
(the heart, blood vessels, lymph glands)
appears to be less in this position; further-
more, the pooling of blood and organ
displacement is minimized. The capabil-
ity of the pilot to perform what tasks
may be expected of him during take-off
is greater in this position because he is
more likely to remain conscious. To de-
rive the greatest benefit, each seat should
be custom-molded to the individual
pilot's contours. In simple centrifuge
tests of low acceleration (4-6g) with no
optimum positioning of the subject, the

Here a beaker of water "boils"—simu-
lating what would happen to body
fluids at very high altitudes without
pressure suits.
conclusion was reached that if the sub-
ject is given some task to do during the
test, he minds the force less and, there-
fore, is better able to stand it.
Also expected during launch and re-
entry are oscillation, spinning or tum-
bling, vibration and noise. If the erratic
motion cannot be controlled in some way,
the only defense the astronaut will have
is preconditioning and experience in
earth-bound simulators. Sound insulation
can be built right into the spacesuit
helmet; this could be removable for com-
munication among the crew in space.
Zero Gravity
Once out into space, the pilot will
encounter zero gravity. Very little is
known of this condition since it does
not occur naturally on earth or in ordi-
nary airplane flight. The only data con-
cerning the effect of real weightlessness
on human beings is that taken during
parabolic trajectory flights in a standard
plane. The zero gravity effect, achieved
by flying the plane in such a way as to
counterbalance the earths gravity at that
point, lasts from 12 to 15 seconds. Long
term effects on the human body cannot
be guessed at on this basis; it is naturally
hoped that they will not be serious when
and if they are ascertained. However, a
short term consideration is motion sick-
ness because one third of all persons
tested on these flights underwent some
degree of uneasiness. Some of these later
became adapted to weightlessness, but it
14
is estimated that about 10% of future
aspirants to space travel will be rejected
due to acute motion sickness.
The "weightless regurgitation phenom-
enon" often occurred when pressure was
put on the stomach, whether a person
was motion sick or not. It usually fol-
lowed a large liquid intake. Digestion
of food would seem to present no diffi-
cult)' if food and drink may be properly
introduced into the gullet. If food is not
well chewed, particles may float up into
the windpipe and choke the eater. Since
fluids tend to remain in globules, a
squeeze bottle for drinking is recom-
mended to prevent drowning in one's
liquid refreshment.
A study of human water elimination
was made during zero gravity. The func-
tion depends very little on gravity, phys-
ically, but subjects in the tests noted a
decrease in the sense of urgency while
weightless. With practice, however, vol-
untary urination was accomplished.
Van Allen Radiation
Probably the most important physio-
logical phase is the ionizing radiation
hazard. In addition to the Van Allen
radiation belts hovering over the earth,
and the indigenous cosmic radiation and
energetic particles of space, many may
bring his own radioactive by-products
with him if he uses nuclear energy to
drive his spaceship.
It is now believed that the Van Allen
belts extend 52,250 miles into space,
the lower one beginning at 1,300 miles
above the earth and ending at 3000 miles,
being 4,000 miles wide north and south,
and the upper one beginning at 8,000
miles and ending at 52,250 miles, being
20,000 miles wide north and south. The
peak count in the belts was 25,600
counts second corresponding to 10
roentgens hour if electrons, or 100
roentgens hour if protons are the fore-
most constituents. Between the belts, the
value fell to about 0.3 roentgens hour.
The maximum radiation dosage recom-
mended by the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion is 0.3 roentgens/ week, which sug-
gests that a shielded, manned satellite
could be sent to orbit between the belts
without too much risk. Three possible
ways of combatting radiation are by
shielding, by magnetic deflection and by
using it as a source of energy. Another
means now being tried out with animals
is prevention of damage by drugs.
Hypobaria demands that the pilot wear
a fuil-pressure suit; at high altitudes, a
man's blood would boil if he were not
wearing such a suit. A frog can stand
a pressure of one millimeter of mercury
for one half hour while all its fluids are
boiling and bacteria can last for six to
eight hours under the same conditions.
Micrometeorites are another space
danger, which would pierce a space
vehicle, resulting in a leak and loss of
whatever pressure there is within. Rus-
sian data indicates that a spaceship
would encounter one gram of micro-
meteorites in 14,000 hours of flight. Rec-
ommended safety features regarding loss
of internal pressure are: multiple wall
and meteor bumper construction, self-
sealing techniques, detection of leaks,
warning of occupants, reserve high pres-
sure gases (including oxygen) to delay
decompression, use of full-pressure suits,
personnel training for emergencies, com-
partmentation, recompression chambers,

sealing leaks.
Oxygen Cycle
Some means must be devised to insure
a constant supply of oxygen before any
really long-range trip can be planned.
The oxygen consumption for one man
sitting and awake is 240 cc/ man-hour,
which is slightly above the basal metab-
olism level. If metabolism could be de-
creased, oxygen supplies would be con-
served. The metabolic rate of the Alaskan
black bear was reduced to 50-60% of
the normal rate during hibernation, while
its body temperature was lowered nine
degrees Fahrenheit. It is assumed tf^
aging continues at 50-60% of the normal
rate, also. Hibernation could be induced
in humans with drugs, or by hypothermia
(lowering the temperature). The person
would have to be awoken periodically
to raise energy levels and to prevent
ventricular fibrillation, a condition which
occurs at temperatures below 86 F. It
is characterized by a quivering of muscle
fibers in the heart, where various groups
of fibers beat independently and without
rhythm. The condition is fatal if not im-
mediately remedied. It seems unlikely
that hibernation will be employed; it
would be a waste of time to send an
unconscious man into space.
Even if the oxygen intake could be
decreased, flights over one month in dur-
ation would require oxygen recycling.
Two ways of doing this are feasible:
employing chemical reduction to re-
verse basic processes of human metab-
olism, and photosynthesis. The latter
method is better, although presently, it
is not as well developed as the former.
The equation of the first method is:
CO; + reducing agent »so!id
carbon + 0.2 f
One drawback here is that something
would have to be done to the solid by-
products before they began to accumu-
late.
The food-waste cycle will be a neces-
sity for long flights. Man needs 1.5 tons
of food and water per year, and even if
he could carry all his food and water
with him, wastes would certainly become
a problem. One would not wish to con-
taminate outer space by jettisoning them.
On short trips, human waste could be
stored in sealed containers, or chemically
reduced to a nontoxic form. The metab-
olism of trace substances must be care-
fully examined; the loss of urea, volatile
amines, and others is important when
the occupied space is sealed.

The first man-carrying satellite will probably be no bigger than this capsule in
which an airman breathed his own private atmosphere, slept half-doubled-up, ate
condensed foods, did physical and mental work while space doctors kept watch
outside.
One cycle that has been proposed is to
process excess metabolic water so that
carbohydates in the form of glucose
water result. The solid residue of urine
could be used to feed algae in the pho-
tosynthesis method of providing oxygen.
X-ray diffraction could be used to check
these materials for poison. This cycle
requires a lot of energy and there is
some question as to the psychological
effect of depending on such a system
for food and water.
To minimize solid waste, a general
theory is that the space diet should con-
sist of highly nutritious liquids which
would be almost entirely absorbed in
the lower tract.
Finally, the temperature must be re-
liably reported to the pilot. Man is a
poor judge of temperature, noticing
changes quite well from 70-150IJ F, a
zone of little danger, while in the highly
dangerous range from 150-250° F, his
perception worsens. The vehicle will need
refrigeration and/or insulation.
Psychological Factors
The second broad aspect is the psy-
chological. The factors which enter in
are, in general:
1. Isolation and confinement
2. Weightlessness, orientation
3. Decreased sensory input
4. Fear
Isolation tests are being conducted to
find out what should be done so that a
pilot can continue to think and work
efficiently under trying conditions. In
total isolation with no assigned tasks
whatever, no subject was able to stay in
the test chamber longer than 70 hours.
Isolation of this kind, if extended beyond

no YOU BELIEVE IN
FLYING SAUCERS?
. ■
If you think this an amusing question, and are about to reply with a
hasty "No," think for a few minutes and perhaps your decision will not be
so quick and simple. Are we not on the threshold of space, rapidly learning
how to move outward from our planet? In ten years or less, man on earth
has changed from thinking in terms of the confines of the earth to thinking
in terms of the solar system and the stars beyond. Much has been discovered,
experiments have placed satellites in orbit, and research is rushing forward
to put man in space.
Science has proved that life and civilization are relatively new on the
earth. The earth is estimated as 11 billion years old and life can be traced
to beginnings only 1 million years ago. Assuming that there is the possi-
bility of life elsewhere in the universe, what has occurred on planets in
other solar systems, planets older than the earth, on which life may have
existed many centuries longer? At some point in their civilization, did they
not reach out and learn the answers to the problems of space travel? As
we expect to eventually conquer the complexities and difficulties of navi-
gating beyond our atmosphere, could not some older, more advanced form
of life have invented a vehicle that successfully overcame the problems of
time, distance, radiation, and others that we have not as yet solved? Then,
too, is it not possible that this form of life may differ from man, having
evolved in a different environment? Therefore, this life might be more suit-
able for space travel than man. Could not a race, similar to ours but exist-
ing for many more years, have evolved a more intelligent being than man,
as he is today on earth? Concerned with his earthly problems of living,
warring, and acquiring control of his earthly environment, man has yet to
turn his'talents to that which is outside his planet. Only by a competitive
need to remain strong and thus be protected, has man begun a race into
space. Might not other beings in other worlds have been quicker in turning
their thoughts to the universe? As one ponders such ideas, the existence
of "flying saucers" from other worlds becomes not a ridiculous theory, but
an unproved possibility. For this reason the Editors of the Technic urge you
to read this thought-provoking and challenging article.
by ARLEIGH J. DAGENAIS, '61E


Kenneth Arnold departed from Chehalis,
Washington, bound for Yakima, Wash-
ington, on a routine flight in his private
plane. Mr. Arnold had made many such
flights previously and was considered an
excellent mountain pilot. As he neared
Mount Rainier, the second highest peak
in the continental United States, he saw
with a start what appeared to be a chain
of unfamiliar aircraft. Observing more
closely, he distinguished a string of nine
very bright, disk-shaped objects, estimat-
ing them to be about 45 to 50 feet in
length. As they flew, the objects wove
in and out between the mountain peaks.
Regaining his composure, Arnold marked
their position on a map and noted the
time, a procedure which he again re-
peated some 102 seconds later. With this
data, a hurried computation put the
objects' speed at almost 1700 miles per
hour.1 No ai craft known at that time
could approach even half that speed.
When Arnold's story broke, it was so
unusual that papers all over the world
gave it front-page space. Thus began the
era of the "flying saucer."
It was only three months later, Sep-
tember, 1947, that the Air Force organ-
ized a formal project for UFO (uniden-
tified flying object) investigation. The
project was established under the juris-
diction of the Air Technical Intelligence
Center (ATIC), one of the most highly
specialized intelligence agencies in the
Air Force. Most of these intelligence
specialists were confident that within a
few months' time they would have the
answer to the question, "What are
UFO's?"
People who have attempted to answer
this question fall into three groups
separated according to the different the-
ories concerning those airborne phenom-
ena. There is a fourth group if one con-
siders the perennial hoaxers and the
writers of saucer lore who print more
fiction than fact. This latter group, how-
ever, will be ignored in this article. One
group consists of those who feel that
all UFO sightings can be explained as
natural occurrences. Another group.
whose position might be called neutral,
is the organization (ATIC) of the U.S.
Air Force, which gathered and investi-
gated the thousands of reports and facts
of the UFO story. A third group con-
sists of the believers in interplanetary
space craft.
Natural Occurrences?
Donald H. Menzel, Professor of Astro-
physics at Harvard University, was a
leading exponent of the group which
considered all saucer sightings as natural
phenomena. He believed that people did
see unusual phenomena but the sightings
were not alien aircraft. What the ob-
servers saw was not imaginary but could
be attributed to some event of nature
He did not place much faith in the
ability of many observers to correctly in-
terpret their observations. In the Arnold
sighting, Menzel derived from Arnold's
statement that the objects' speed was
only 50 miles per hour. Menzel con-
cluded that what Arnold really saw was
billowing blasts of snow lifted from the
mountains by turbulent air. These shift-
ing, tilting clouds of snow reflected the-
sun as mirrors.-' Many of Professor Men-
zel's explanations of other saucer inci-
dents were to be closely congruent. Haze,
reflections in fog or mist, and ice cry-
stals in the sky reflecting the sun's rays
were the majority of his conclusions.
Menzel's theories did not pass without
challenge, however. Why were not such
sightings repoited before 1947? And.
concerning the Arnold report specifically,
could billowing blasts of snow be travel-
ing at, or at leait appear to be traveling
at, a speed of 500 miles per hour?
The ATIC saucer investigation group
did not receive first-hand information on
the Arnold sighting. In fact, one might
say the Air Force investigating group
was a result of the incident. However,
when one ATIC expert was later asked
to comment on Professor Menzel's state-
ment of "wind whipping snow," his
answer was a flat, "impossible." He
asserted that he had lived in the Pacific
Northwest for many years, and that it
would be impossible to find powdered
snow so low in the mountains in June.3
Project Blue Book, as the Air Force
group was coded, labled the Arnold
report "unknown."
The Mantell Crash
Tragedy entered the picture in January
of 1948. A National Guard pilot was
killed chasing a UFO. On that after-
noon, control tower operators of God-
man Air Force Base, outside Louisville,
Kentucky, received a query from the
state police as to the possibility of any
unusual aircraft in the vicinity. A quick-
check by the operators with appropriate
agencies met with a negative answer.
Many people in outlying districts near
the air base reported an unknown ob-
ject in the sky, moving in the general
direction of Godman. A half hour later,
the tower operators sighted the object
and called the base operations officer,

In 1954 it was believed that U. S. Navy
ballons like the one shown here were
the cause of many "flying saucer" re-
ports.
who came to the tower to have a look
at the object through binoculars. No
one could identify the object. Minutes
later, four F-51's, single engine fighter
aircraft, flew across the field. The flight
leader, Captain Mantell, was called by
radio and asked to take a look at the
object and try to identify it. Mantell
climbed his aircraft into the sky and
was soon lost from sight. After a few
minutes of silence, Mantell called the
tower and said, "I see something above
and ahead of me and I'm still climbing
.... I've sighted the thing. It looks
metallic and it's tremendous in size ....
It's above me and I'm gaining on it. I'm
going to 20,000 feet." Captain Mantell
never talked to anyone again. The tower

Although we may never have "push-button

Street. Will you please give me three
"Thank you."
Pictured above is a possible glimpse
of the future . . . when weather will be
controlled by man. Surely one day men
will be capable of controlling the weather
but that day is very far away. Today we
are just on the verge of great discoveries
which will eventually lead us to our
final goal, weather control.
First Attempts
To see what weather may be like in
the future one must look at the first
attempts of weather modification. Before
World War II only a few scientists
thought about the idea of controlling the
weather. Active interest in weather con-
trol at this time came only from our
American Indians who offered their rain
dances as one positive method for modi-
fying the weather. This naturally was
frowned upon by the serious-minded for
obvious reasons. Then along came the
Second World War and suddenly there
was a need for further knowledge of
weather modification. For instance, many
airfields were fogged in at night. At-
tempting to land a plane in a heavy-
English fog was almost suicide since our
planes did not have radar yet. If there
were some way to eliminate the fog,
thought the Air Force, the bases could
be kept open all the time. A few British
engineers solved the problem by setting
afire two gasoline-filled troughs, one
placed on each side of the runway. The
heat developed lifted the fog to a point
where the stars were actually visible, but
the method proved to be quite costly as
gasoline was consumed at a high rate—
in fact, the total amount for the project
was a high percent of all the petroleum
shipped to England during that year.
The use of gasoline just employed
brute force to control the weather and,
for reasons previously stated, proved to
be uneconomical. The thought that if
man could use nature's natural methods
of making weather he would be far better
off was becoming prevalent in the scien-
tist's mind. After World War II many
ideas were tried throughout the world.
In this country most research was carried
on by private companies and by uni-
versities.
Committee Report
After the Korean War, the govern-
ment began to take an interest in weather
control. The Advisory Committee on
Weather Control was set up by an act of
Congress in August, 1953. This com-
mittee was to make "... a complete
study and evaluation of public and pri-
vate experiments in weather control for
the purpose of determining the extent of
which the United States should experi-
ment with, engage in, or regulate activ-
ities designed to control weather condi-
tions." This committee was not to con-
duct basic research in weather modifica-
tion.
On December 31, 1957, the final re-
port of the advisory committee was is-
sued. The report contained statistics on
and information about many attempted
projects and also much about the legal
situation involved with weather control.
A summary of the report stated: when
silver iodide was used as the seeding
agent, the seeding of winter type storm
clouds in mountainous areas produced
an average increase in precipitation of
ten to fifteen percent with heavy odds
that this increase was not the result of
natural variations in the amount of rain-
fall. In non-mountainous areas, on the
other hand, the same procedure as above
did not show any increase in precipita-
tion although some effects may have been
produced [but were not detected]. "No
evidence was found in the evaluation of
any project which was intended to in-
crease precipitation that cloud seeding
had produced a detectable negative effect
on precipitation," the report stated, and
then went on to say that conventional
seeding with generators on the ground
is a valid technique for producing ice
crystals in favorable summer and winter
storm conditions. In conclusion, the com-
mittee stated that there must be much
work done in basic research.
From the time the report was sub-
mitted, until the present, much has been
done with weather modification. Extensive
seeding projects using many different
types of ice crystal inducing agents have
been tried. The University of Michigan,
with its mobile meteorological van, has

dioxide pellets.
participated in a cloud modification pro-
gram in Arizona and New Mexico during
the summer, one of many such projects
sponsored by university and governmental
research agencies. As the space age began,
atmospheric scientists in the United States
took immediate advantage of a new
technique for physical measurements of
the earth by sending aloft two meteor-
ological satellites—one to register cloud
cover, the other to measure the earth's
radiation—neither possible before over so
large an area and so short a time interval.
All the meteorological effects men-
tioned so far pertain to the present status
of weather control, but in addition there
are many ideas about future weather
and weather control methods. One of
these has already become a reality, the
weather satellite, as stated before.
Satellites Will Help
With a system of weather satellites
we would be able to determine the gene-
sis, movement and breakup of storms.
One satellite in a polar orbit would map
the entire cloud system of the earth every
twelve hours. We would then know how
many storm systems there are on the
earth at any one moment, whether they
are variable, and whether there are more
in one season than in another. Improve-
ments in forecasting the weather would
not occur as quickly as the satellites are
put up, since assimilation of the material


sent back from a satellite would take a
long time. One of the quickest improve-
ments in forecasting and weather control
would happen when a satellite is capable
of carrying television equipment. This
will give meteorologists instant notice of
hurricanes, tornadoes, and other severe
storms which then can be dissipated or
diverted by some means unknown to us
today. Another group of stationary satel-
lites twenty-two thousand miles up would
generate ultra-violet light and could turn
darkness into semi-daylight.
Satellites will help us understand the
weather but they cannot truly modify it.
With methods of altering the atmosphere
such as the atom bomb, the plains states
might conceivably be freed of droughts.

temperature of Siberia, breeding ground
for much of the world's weather, may
one day be drastically modified by huge
engineering projects made possible by
atomic power. One recent Russian en-
deavor is the building of a dam to create
a vast artificial lake which in turn would
increase the moisture in the air and raise
the general temperature. Nature has giv-
en the United States the Great Lakes
which demonstrate the effect every win-
ter. If many dams were built, a whole
section of the globe would have a differ-
ent climate. One project which has been
discussed is a dam between Alaska and
Russia, across the Bering Straits. This
would stop cold water from entering the
Pacific and would thus let the Japanese
Current continue northward instead of
west as it does now. A bit of opposition
to this idea, which will be discussed later,
has flared up. Another idea in the same
area involves melting the polar icecap so
that the land underneath might be used.
This as mentioned before would change
the world's weather drastically.
One factor that is changing the weather
today and will most likely continue to
do so in the future is the increasing
amount of carbon dioxide in the air.
During this century the temperature has
already increased two degrees. Wholesale-
use of fission or fusion for power may
stop this increase.
If we learn how to reduce heat loss
from the surface of large bodies of water
hurricanes might be dissipated since it
is known that hurricanes breed over

SIDE-BAND
With the backing of the Strategic Air Command
and several electronic firms SSB is rapidly re-
placing standard amplitude modulation for
communication purposes.
by RAY IKOLA, '61E
During the past decade, a new method
of radiotelephony has gained
prominence as an effective mode of com-
munication. This method is known as
single-sideband, or more briefly as S.S.B.
Until recently, amplitude modulation has
been accepted as the standard mode of
communication in commercial installa-
tions. However, the development of the
single-sideband system in recent yea's
has given rise to the belief of many peo-
ple that S.S.B. is superior to A.M. for
communication purposes.
When we speak of a communication
system in this article, we are referring to
a system whose sole purpose is to convey
a message with no emphasis placed on the
audio fidelity of the signal. Such systems
as ground-air radios, taxi radios, and
police radios all come under this defini-
tion. Although single-sideband was used
AMPLITUDE
as far back as 1923, there were too many
defects to allow its use as a common
mode of communication. During World
War II, the single-sideband system found
only limited use for communication in
the armed services. Since that time, single-
sideband has seen rapid development,
due, to a large extent, to the pressure
exerted upon electronics equipment man-
ufacturers by the radio amateurs.
What is single-sideband, and why do
some hold it superior to amplitude mod-
ulation? One definition of single-side-
band is: "The suppression of an 'image
sideband' for the purpose of reducing to
a minimum the frequency band necessary
to transmit a given amount of intelli-
gence." Let us examine this definition to
see what it means, how the desired effect
is achieved, and why this effect is desir-
able.
Figure I. A carrier wave, modulated
by a 1000 cycle audio tone, may be
represented by two sidebands occurring
as mirror images of each other on both
sides of the carrier when amplitude is
plotted against frequency.
-IOOO f +1000
FRE5UEKCY
AM Theory Necessary
In order to understand the principle
of single-sideband, it is first necessary to
clarify the picture of a normal amplitude-
modulated signal. We know that any
radio frequency signal can be represented
by a thin vertical line, when frequenq'
is plotted against amplitude as shown in
Fig. 1. However, each telephony signal
contains at least two other components.
(For the sake of simplicity, we will as-
sume that we wish to transmit only a
pure tone, rather than a complicated
voice figure. We choose the frequency
of this tone to be 1,000 cycles, as shown
in Fig. 1.) One of these components,
then, is the sum of the center frequenq'
and the audio frequency, and the other
is the difference between the center fre-
quency and the audio frequency. As
shown in Fig. 1, the center frequency
is f, with the frequency of the audio
tone occuring as mirror images of each
other on each side of f. The center fre-
quency f is known as the carrier, and the
other two components of the signal art
called the sidebands. From this picture
of a radiotelephony signal, we see that
modulation is simply a pair of new sig-
nals occuring at frequencies "alongside
the carrier."
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


We note from the above discussion
that the carrier wave itself conveys no
intelligence. All the intelligence of the
signal is contained in the two sidebands.
Since the carrier is of no use, as far as
transmitting intelligence is concerned, it
is possible to eliminate it entirely at the
transmitter. However, this carrier must be
provided again at the receiving station if
the signal is to be intelligible. One of
the sidebands may also be omitted as
long as the other one is retained to con-
vey the intelligence of the signal. It is
easily seen that the frequency spectrum
occupied by the signal has effectively been
cut in half. This means that two stations
can operate on the same central fre-
quency, one using the upper sideband
and the other using the lower. This,
then, is the principle under which single-
sideband operates.
The first thing that must be done to
achieve this effect is to suppress the
carrier. Usualy this is achieved by using
a device known as a balanced modulator.
The length and scope of this article
does not permit us to go into detail on
the workings of this device. Let it suffice
to say that the carrier is introduced in
such a way that it will not appear in
the output. However, this process does
not eliminate the sidebands which are
still present in the output.
Eliminate One Sideband

Ray's main interests outside of
school are hi-fi and amateur radio
rier, we have what is known as a double-
sideband signal. The next logical step in
producing a single-sideband signal is to
eliminate one of the sidebands. The two
principal methods of accomplishing this
are the filter system and the phasing sys-
tem. In the filter system the double-side-
band signal is fed to a sharp filter which
is designed in such a way as to pass one
sideband and reject the other. Adding
radio frequency selectivity to the front
end of a receiver to reduce the image
is the same process in reverse of adding
the filter to a double-sideband signal to
reduce the "image sideband." In the case

of the phasing system, two double-side-
band signals are produced which differ
only in phase. When the difference in
phase is correct, the combination of the
two signals will eliminate one wideband
and reinforce the other. Such a system
as this generally involves more compli-
cated circuitry than the filter system.
What, then, are the advantages of the
single-sideband system as opposed to am-
plitude modulation? To answer this ques-
tion it might be well to enumerate the
disadvantages of the A.M. system, for
the inherent design of the S.S.B. system
eliminates many of the difficulties stem-
ming from the use of A.M. There are
two chief disadvantages of the A.M.
systems currently in use. They are: (1)
the large percentage of power used for
transmission of the carrier, and (2) the
interference great among signals.
Greater Effective Power
It is known that the power in each
sideband is one-fourth of the total output
power of an A.M. signal. Since there
are two sidebands in every signal, it is
seen that one half of the total power is
used in the sidebands and one half is
used in the carrier. It is also known that
no intelligence is conveyed by the carrier
signal. From this information, it is easily
concluded that a large amount of power
is devoted to transmission of the carrier

equipment now on the market is this

He's an internationally known mathematician
but, strangely enough, he doesn't even exist.
by IRVING SALMEEN, '63E
His name is Greek, his nationality,
French, he is one of the most in-
fluential mathematicians of the twentieth
century. His works have given mathe-
maticians a powerful reference tool and
have helped to unify many scattered
branches of mathematics. Nearly every
mathematician knows a few stories about
him, and is iikely to have made up a



few more. Although most of these leg-
ends and stories are fictitious, they grow
in number every day. But the strangest
fact of all, is that he doesn't even exist.
The name of this imaginary French-
man is Nicolas Bourbaki. Actually the
name is a pseudonym adopted by an in-
formal corporation of 10 to 20 French
mathematicians (the number varies) who
write on the various fields of mathe-
matics. They first appeared on the scene
around the mid-nineteen thirties when
they began to publish papers and notes

well-known. This work is perhaps the
most comprehensive treatise ever written
on mathematics. It begins with the most
elementary principles and ends with the
most advanced applications. So far twen-
ty volumes have appeared (nearly 3,000
pages) and the work is far from com-
plete.
Since the group was founded by
Frenchmen, it is an unwritten law of the
group, that only Frenchmen can be mem-
bers. There has been only one exception
to this and that was for Samuel Eilenberg
(known to his friends of youth as S2PJ,
Smart Sammy, the Polish Prodigy). The
General Bourbaki, whose name was not
Nicolas but Charles Denis Sauter, is
depicted in this drawing based on an
engraving. He was once offered the
crown of Greece.
rule was waived for him because he
speaks French like a native and knows
more about algebraic topology than any
Frenchman. It is a necessity that all
members be French for when men such
as Andre Weil, Jean Delsarte, Jean Dieu-
donne, and Claude Chevallier get to-
gether with their colleagues, the French
flows fast and furious. It is not sufficient
to just know how to speak French, but
it is a requirement to know even the
latest Parisian student slang.
Why Bourbaki?
Why the name Bourbaki was selected
is shrouded in mystery. One legend has
it that it was inspired by an army officer
of some importance in the Franco-Prus-
sian War, General Charles Denis Sauter
Bourbaki. Charlie was a very colorful
character. In 1862, after several success-
ful war exploits he was offered the throne
of Greece, but declined the opportunity.
As luck would have it the tide of battle
turned and the fortunes of war were not
kind to him. In 1871 he was forced to
flee to Switzerland with a small remnant
of his army. While in Switzerland he
must have become frustrated and he tried
to shoot himself, but apparently he
missed because he lived to the ripe old
age of 83. Supposedly there is a statue
erected in his honor at Nancy. This
might possibly explain the connection
between the group and the name because
several of the founders were associated
with the University of Nancy.
Another legend surrounding the name
concerns the students of the "Ecole

mathematicians receive their early train-
ing. About twenty to thirty years ago,
the first-year students were supposedly
exposed to an annual lecture by a dis-
tinguished visitor, Nicolas Bourbaki. Actu-
ally Bourbaki was an amateur actor whose
lecture was a masterpiece of mathematical
double talk. Since many of the founders
of the Bourbaki clan did receive their
early training there, it is possible that
the name came from him, provided there
is any basis for the story.
Scientific publication under a pseudo-
nym is not now. The English mathe-
matician William Sealy Gosset published
his first works on small samples under
the name "Student" supposedly to avoid
embarrassment to his employers, (a beer
brewery). Somewhere around the time
Bourbaki was started another group ap-
peared under the name of E. S. Pondi-
czery, reputed to be of the Royal Institute
of Poldavia. The initials E. S. P. and
R. I. P. were the outgrowth of an article-
by them on extrasensory preception.
Most of their work, though, was on
mathematical games and curiosities. They
are probably one of the first to publish
under a double pseudonym. One of their
papers, which appeared in the American
Mathematical Monthly, was on the mathe-
matical theory of big-game hunting. Be-
cause of the obviously facetious nature
of the subject, they obtained permission
to publish it under the name of H.
Petard.
Originally the name Bourbaki was
adopted half in fun and half to avoid
a long boring list of authors on the title
page. The name was intended as a cor-
porate name instead of a disguise. The
members are not sworn to an oath of
secrecy and the names of them are an
open secret to most mathematicians. Many
amusing incidents have resulted from the
name, and the members so thotoughly
enjoyed the joke, that they have gone
along with the legends and stories.
According to Legend
According to one legend, their major
work. Elements of Mathematics, was
originated as a result of a discussion be-
tween Andre Weil and Jean Delsarte on
how calculus should be taught. Whatever
its original purpose, it certainly is not
today elementary pedagogy. It is as if a
discussion on the best way to teach the
elements of music gave rise to a complete
text on harmony and musicology. Inci-
dentally, mathematicians supposedly con-
sider the calculus to be as trivial as
musicians consider the music of Victor
Herbert.
The whole work when it is complete
will consist of several parts, but the
twenty volumes that have appeared have
not even completed section I, titled, The
Fundamental Structures of Analysis. So
far this first part has six subdivisions
which could prove a mild shock to the
classical mathematician who considers
mathematics in terms of arithmetic, al-
gebra, geometry, and other "old fashion
words." These subdivisions are: 1. Set
Theory 2. Algebra 3. General Topology
4. Functions of a real variable 5. Top-
ological Vector Spaces 6. Integration.
Each volume comes equipped with a
loose insert of four pages explaining how
to read the work, the prerequisites for
reading the text (about two years of uni-
versity mathematics), a description of
the organization and specifications of the
logical, rigorous order in which the text
must be studied. The insert also explains
some of the teaching tricks, some of
which are very unique. One of these is
to warn the reader whenever the subject
becomes especially slippery, that is, when
he is likely to make an erroneous as-
sumption, by an S curve in the margin.
Other Bourbaki gadgetry includes fold-
out sheets that summarize important
definitions, assumptions, and concepts, a
dictionary for every book that includes
both Bourbique terminology and common
terminology. Also, every volume is ac-
companied by an excellent set of cleveily
contrived exercises. Many of these prob-
lems are invented by the authors, or
different versions of old problems.
Systematic and Thorough
The presentation of the material is
very systematic and thorough and often
contains a brilliant historical background
of the subject. One rather curious thing
about these historical sketches is that
only in rare instances will there be a
reference to the classics and the source
of modem contributions is almost totally
omitted. No deception is intended; after
all, Bourbaki doesn't claim to have in-
vented all of modern mathematics, but
it may result in confusing future mathe-
matical historians. His approach to new
subjects is rather radical because of his
insistence upon the right order of doing
things and his clean, economical organ-
ization of ideas. In fact, his style of
presentation is so thorough that very
little is left to the imagination of the
reader.
A typical example of the thoroughness
of the work is his treatment of the
definition of the number one. He devotes
nearly 200 pages in preliminary defini-
tions and explanations. Then the actual
definition is presented in terms of highly
condensed symbols, explaining in a foot-
note that the condensed notation was
necessary because the unabbreviated sys-
tem would require tens of thousands of
symbols.
It is a wonder how a work of such
magnitude ever gets started. A very large
part of the credit goes to Jean Dieudonne,
originally from the University of Nancy
and now with Northwestern, who has
been Bourbaki's chief writer from almost
the beginning. Since Dieudonne is also

Irving Salmeen, a graduate of

Engineering but hopes to get his

ties were both mental and physical
—ranging from basketball, track,
and skiing to dramatics, debate,

ing in the office of an engineering

his own name, confusion often arises in
attempting to distinguish between his
private work and his efforts for Bourbaki.
According to one story, the records are
kept straight in a very amazing manner.
According to this one. Dieudonne once
published a paper for Bourbaki and later
an error was found. Dieudonne corrected
the mistake in a paper entitled "On an
Error of N. Bourbaki" and signed J.
Dieudonne.
A great deal of work goes into the
preparation of a volume. Each year the
group convenes in a pleasant French
vacation spot to hash out problems and
to set the general policy of the work.
Much to the surprise of the members,
the work has turned out to be a financial
success and the royalties are sufficient to
cover transportation, housing costs, and
substantial food and wines to lubricate
the proceedings. The first few days of
the convention are spent in relaxation
and general shop talk. But after the fun
is over a great deal of work gets done.
The First Draft
Once a particular subject has been de-
cided upon, one member agrees to write
the first draft. The brave volunteer is
letting himself in for a trying experience.
After the draft is finished, copies are
made and sent to the rest of the mem-
bers. From here on in the original author
is in for merciless criticism. Chances are
that the draft will be completely rejected.
For example, the first draft written on
integration was done by Dieudonne and
soon became known as Dieudonne's mon-
ster. The monster was so strongly criti-
cised that it never reached even the pre-
liminary stages of publication.
After the first draft has run the gaunt-
let, a second draft is prepared, possibly
by another member. This goes through
the mill, is revised again, and another
draft drawn up. This process goes on
for possibly six or seven times before it
finally is accepted for publication. The
result of this painstaking effort is not a
textbook that can be placed in the hands
of a beginner, but it is an encyclopedia
of mathematics, without which 20th cen-
tury mathematics would be quite different.
Mathematics is a young man's game
and indeed that is what is found in
Bourbaki. This is indicated by the fact
that upon reaching the age of fifty,
Dieudonne and Weil, although they were
founding fathers, retired. Earlier, at the
outset of the organization, they announced
their retirement at the age of fifty, and
kept their promise. Incidentally, Weil

Nicolas Bourbaki is fancifully represented by this milling throng of French mathe-
maticians. Bourbaki appears to consist of 10 to 20 men at any one time. Any resem-
blance between these men and the individuals in the drawing is entirely coinci-
dental.
may not be known to the general public,
but he is considered by many of his
colleagues to be the greatest living mathe-
matician. His work on algebraic number
theory and algebraic geometry have had
a profound effect on the world of mathe-
matics.
The youthful exuberance of the mem-
bers is often the cause of considerable-
irritation to their enemies. The officials
of the American Mathematical Society
were not at all pleased when they re-
ceived an application for membership
signed by N. Bourbaki. Needless to say,
they rejected the application. The secre-
tary of the organization wrote a very
cold letter suggesting that they apply for
institutional membership. Since Bourbaki
did not want to admit that he did not
exist, nothing more was said concerning
the matter.
Effective Steps
Even though there is no oath of secrecy
among the members, they do not like
to have their secrets revealed. The cor-
poration has shown their ability to take
effective steps against any informers.
About 1947 the Book of the Year of
the Encyclopedia Britannica had a short
paragraph about Bourbaki in which they
referred to him as a group. The author
of the article was Ralph Boas, at that
time executive editor of the Mathematical
Reviews. Soon after the paragraph ap-
peared, the editors of the Britannica re-
ceived a very injured letter from Bour-
baki protesting the allegation that Bour-
baki did not exist. To add to the con-
fusion and embarrassment of the editors,
a member of the math department of the
University of Chicago wrote a very
shrewdly worded letter in which he im-
plied, but did not state, that Bourbaki
did exist. The matter was finally cleared
up by a letter from the American Mathe-
matical Society in which they told the
whole story about Bourbaki. Incidentally,
the letter was written by the same secre-
tary who had refused Bourbaki member-
ship. But in the end, Bourbaki got the
last laugh. He gathered together all of
his international resources and colleagues
and circulated a rumor that Boas did not
exist and that he was actually a group
of young American mathematicians that
acted jointly as the editors of the Mathe-
matical Reviews.
Whether the stories about him are true
or not, is known only by the members
and certainly they will not divulge the
truth. Stories about him are concocted
daily and old stories are stretched. Most
of them are amusing and add a little
spice to the rigorous world of mathe-
matics. One thing is not fiction, and that
is his tremendous influence on mathe-
matics. His work has brought unity for
the first time to many scattered branches.
For the first time general topology and
multilinear algebra have been put in
systematic form, which is easily available.
Many of his concepts and inventions
have had a powerful effect on the mathe-
matical world. If it weren't for him,
mathematics would be vastly different
from the way we find it today.

AND
RESEARCH
by MURRAY PATTERSON, '60E
The successful firing of a five-stage
rocket designed and built by University
of Michigan engineering personnel, a pro-
posal on moon exploration, and some
views on international control of radio-
active wastes, all by U of M staff and
faculty, are reported this month on the
local education and research scene.
Five-Stage Rocket
The Army successfully fired a five-
stage rocket, built by The University of
Michigan, on November 10 from the
National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration launching facility at Wallops
Island, Va.

Based on "quick look" data, the rocket
went an altitude of 1,050 miles, the
highest ever reach from this facility.
The rocket—dubbed the "Strong Arm"
by the Army—landed in the Atlantic
Ocean some 800 miles from the launch-
ing pad.
It obtained measurements beginning at
875 miles. The rocket was designed to
obtain measurements of electron density
in the ionosphere above 500 miles, at
which altitude Russia's Sputnik III made
measurements. The project was sponsored
and directed by the Army's Ballistic Re-
search Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving
Ground, Md. It was conducted through
the U-M Research Institute.
Instruments carried by the rocket to
make the measurements were designed
by Dr. Lyman Orr of the U-M Electronic
Defense Group.
"Signals lasted 1500 seconds (25 min-
utes) here," reported William H. Hansen.
U-M aeronautical research engineer who

feet long five-stage rockets fired by
University of Michigan engineers. The

five-stage rocket. The signals lasted an
additional 15 or 20 seconds at Aberdeen
Proving Ground.
"Everything right from the start right
through the finish was good," Hansen
said.
Observations made with stop watches
indicated all stages fired as programmed,
he said. The first radar "workings" gave
the predicted velocity at 300,000 feet
altitude as 17,250 feet per second, the
U-M engineer said.
It will take several weeks to get an
accurate trajectory, Hansen continued,
"but indications are pretty sound that all
worked well."
Asked how the Michigan engineers
felt about the firing, he said: "We feel
fine. There were no rude surprises."
Assisting in design and construction of
the rocket were Prof. Robert Howe and
engineer Fred F. Fischbach of the U-M
Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineer-
ing Department. Helping in the design
of the instruments was Pieter Cath of
the U-M Electronics Defense Group.
Moon Surface
One of the things man wants to know
before he lands an exploring expedition
on the moon is whether the moon's sur-
face dust will support the ship and
crew, or swallow them up.
It's generally conceded that the moon's
surface consists of dust but little is
known about its depth and weight-sup-
porting ability.
One method of finding out more about
the moon's surface is suggested by three
University of Michigan engineers in an
article in the November issue of the
technical magazine Aero-Space Engineer-
ing.

Engineer William H. Hansen stands next
to the fourth and fifth stages of the
rocket prepared at U. of M. It was fired
from Wallops Island, Virginia.
The three are Keeve M. Siegel, pro-
fessor of electrical engineering and head
of the U-M's Radiation Laboratory;
Thomas B. A. Senior and William E.
Fensler, research engineers of the U-M
Research Institute.
They suggest that a radar-equipped
satellite be placed in orbit around the
moon and that data from the radar sig-
nals bounced off the moon's surface be
telemetered back to earth.
By determining from this data how
"reflective" the moon's surface is to radar
signals, an accurate estimate of its den-
sity and consistency may be made, the
U-M men say. Such radar investigation
cannot now be made from earth because
the earth's ionosphere blocks that part of
an earth-originated radar signal needed
for such an investigation.
Siegel, Fensler and Senior say that
space equipment now under development
could be used for the experiment they
suggest.
Radioactive Waste
Establishing international controls over
radioactive contamination of the high
seas should be considered soon, two Uni-
versity of Michigan legal researchers be-
lieve.
Lee M. Hydeman and William H.
Berman outline their views in a paper
prepared for an International Confer-
ence on Disposal of Radioactive wastes,
which was held in November. They are
co-directors of the U-M Law School's
Atomic Energy Research Project.
Attempts to develop this kind of inter-
national control should not be postponed
until a serious threat is posed or even
until national approaches to the sea dis-
Professor K. M. Siegel of the Electrical
Engineering Department and head of
the U. of M. Radiation Laboratory in
collaboration with his colleagues has
made a proposal for exploring the sur-
face layer of the moon by radar obser-
vations. They say that space equipment
now under development could be used
for this experiment.

posal of radioactive wastes become too
fixed," they declare.
Hydeman and Berman suggest the
International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) could administer and enforce
any appropriate agreement to insure
nuclear disposal practices at sea.
At present, the U-M exports note, the
U.S. and other nations cannot protect
themselves legally from the effects of
radioactive pollution outside their bound-
aries. Pollution can occur from upstream
use of rivers, radioactive waste disposal
inside the territorial waters of other
countries, and even from release of wastes
on the high seas.

The field has never been broader
The challenge has never been greater
Engineers at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft today are concerned
with the development of all forms of flight propulsion
systems—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and other advanced
types for propulsion in space. Many of these systems are so
entirely new in concept that their design and development,
and allied research programs, require technical personnel
not previously associated with the development of aircraft
engines. Where the company was once primarily interested
in graduates with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical
engineering, it now also requires men with degrees in
electrical, chemical, and nuclear engineering, and in physics,
chemistry, and metallurgy.
Included in a wide range of engineering activities open to
technically trained graduates at all levels are these four
basic fields:
ANALYTICAL ENGINEERING Men engaged in this
activity are concerned with fundamental investigations in
the fields of science or engineering related to the conception
of new products. They carry out detailed analyses of ad-
vanced flight and space systems and interpret results in
terms of practical design applications. They provide basic
information which is essential in determining the types of
systems that have development potential.
DESIGN ENGINEERING The prime requisite here is an
active interest in the application of aerodynamics, thermo-
dynamics, stress analysis, and principles of machine design
to the creation of new flight propulsion systems. Men en-
gaged in this activity at P&amp;WA establish the specific per-
formance and structural requirements of the new product
and design it as a complete working mechanism.
EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING Here men supervise
and coordinate fabrication, assembly and laboratory testing
of experimental apparatus, system components, and devel-
opment engines. They devise test rigs and laboratory setups,
specify instrumentation and direct execution of the actual
test programs. Responsibility in this phase of the develop-
ment program also includes analysis of test data, reporting
of results and recommendations for future effort
MATERIALS ENGINEERING Men active in this field
at P&amp;WA investigate metals, alloys and other materials
under various environmental conditions to determine their
usefulness as applied to advanced flight propulsion systems.
They devise material testing methods and design special
test equipment. They are also responsible for the determina-
tion of new fabrication techniques and causes of failures or
manufacturing difficulties.

Interest in Electric Car
Revives
The electric car, which passed from
the American scene in the 1920's, may be
on its way back, modernized and trans-
formed into the "car-of-the-future."
The possible renaissance of the battery-
driven automobile has nothing to do with
nostalgia for the good old days. It's
simply a matter of economics. The elec-
tric car of tomorrow, as visualized by
visionaries in automotive and engineering
circles, will be cheaper to operate than
today's gasoline-powered automobiles.
What's more, it will be practically
trouble-free, eliminating costly service
bills.
Key to the successful development of
this economical electric "dream car'' may
well be the sintered-plate, nickel-cadium
battery which is already widely used in
jet aircraft, missiles, merchant ships and
scores of industrial and household appli-
cations.
Research is in the early, exploratory
stage at this point. But if the engineers
come up with the right answers as to
vehicle size, cost, etc. indicating the
practicality of modern electric cars, man-
ufacturers expect the nickel-cadmium bat-
tery to be the heart of the proposed
power plant.
The short life of conventional batter
ies doomed earlier attempts to build i
practical, low-cost electric car. The sin-
tered-plate, nickel-cadium battery does
not have this drawback; it can be ex-
pected to last the life of the car. At the
same time, it can be charged considerably
more quickly than other batteries. Each
cell is made up of plates of carbonyl nick-
el powder, sintered on a foundation of
nickel wire mesh. The resulting rugged,
but porous, structure reliably retains the
active material, giving long life, and pro-
vides the large effective plate area
needed to permit high charge and dis-
charge rates.
The biggest hurdle on the road to a
feasible, economical electric car is to
find a way to extend the range of the
power plant and still keep the vehicle
small and light. At the present time,
batteries need recharging after less than
100 miles of travel. To overcome this
problem, engineers are exploring the
feasibility of employing a generator driv-
en by a small auxiliary gasoline engine
to constantly recharge the battery during
operation. The one- or two-cylinder en-
gine would use only a small amount of
gas to keep the battery on constant charge
during operation of the car.
Besides saving on gas and maintenance
the electric car visualized by the research-
ers would be simplicity itself as far as
operation is concerned. The speed of the
electric motor propelling the car would
be controlled by a foot accelerator. Even
operation of the gasoline motor-generator
would be automatic, requiring no action
by the driver. Controls on the car would
consist of a steering wheel, the acceler-
ator, the brake and a lever to put the
car in reverse.
Nickel oxide is the active material in
the positive plate of the nickel-cadmium
battery; metallic cadmium in the negative.
The electrolyte is a 30-percent-by-weight
solution of potassium hydroxide in dis-
tilled water. The battery requires only a
few drops of water a year. It can hold
its charge and be charged and discharged
under the most extreme temperature
changes, ranging from desert heat to sub-
zero cold. Thus, a car equipped with the
battery would start immediately in any
kind of weather.
Glycerine Has Role in I.G.Y.
Detailed information just released on
the famous "gasoline bricks" carried by
the Russians on their International Geo-
physical Year Expedition to Antarctica
shows glycerine to be one of the ingred-
ients in their formulation. Developed at
the Institute of Fuels of the U S.S.R.'s
Academy of Sciences, the bricks, bright
yellow in color, are a highly concentrated
solid emulsion consisting of 95% gaso-
line trapped in honeycomb-like cells. The
emulsion material, a distilled water solu-
tion of glycerine, ammonium chloride,
casein and polyvinyl alcohol, is combined
with the gasoline by mechanical and
ultrasonic-wave agitation for 5-6 minutes.
After addition of a 2Qr/r formaldehyde
solution to further increase the viscosity,
the mixture is allowed to thicken. It is
then pressed into long strands, cut to the
desired briquet shapes and dried. Before
use, the bricks are transformed back to

that breaks up the solid and squeezes the
gasoline from the honeycomb cells of the
emulsion. The Russians report that gaso-
line losses are less than three per cent.
Super-small Light Bulb
The smallest incandescent lamp ever
produced on an assembly line is small
enough to pass through the eye of a
darning needle.
The new microminiature lamp, called
the Sylvania Mite-T-Lite, has immediate
applications in transistorized circuits in
missiles, computers and electronic systems.
O. Howard Biggs, divisional Vice
President-Research and Engineering, said
"the development of techniques making
mass production of the lamp possible
represents a significant step forward in
the trend towards microminiaturization."
It is expected the immediate additional
applications will be found in airborne-
electronic systems, high speed punch-card
and tape readout devices, compact matrix-
displays, photoelectric logic systems, oth-
er microminiature circuits and in the
jewelry and decorative arts fields.
The body of the lamp is cylindrical
with a nominal diameter of .040 inches.
Nominal body length is 0.125 inches.
The lamp leads are platinum in a diam-
eter of 0.005 inches. The filament is
0.00025 inch tungsten wire of approxi-
mately 30 turns.
The diminutive lamp can be seen in a
normally illuminated room. Its light out-
put is in the order of 100 millilumens
at 1.5 volts input. The efficiency of the
lamp is approximately 1.5 lumens per
watt.
The very low current and voltage re-
quirements of the lamp immediately sug-
gest uses in indicating devices in port-
able equipment operating from batteries,
Mr. Biggs said.
"Because it can be operated directly
from the output of a transistor, the Mite-
T-Lite will be used in many display de-
vices consisting of a matrix of many
lamps for such purposes as computer
readout displays and arrays for anima-
tion," he added.
Eliminates Torn Streets
Sewer pipe now can be placed under
streets without digging a trench in the
street. An engineer developed a glorified
screwdriver to dig a hole beneath the
street, when Klamath Falls, Ore., resi-
dents became annoyed with the tearing
up of roads. Drilling time for pipe cross-
ing underneath a 25-foot street averages
3 minutes.
Picture Freezer for TV Editing
A video picture freezer which instant-
ly stops TV picture action and holds the
frozen image on its screen for as long
as ten minutes is now available.
The new Hughes storage monitor is
equipped with a five-inch Hughes Tono-
tron tube, which can display a continuous
television picture, and "freeze" the action
at any desired time.
The Hughes storage monitor has a
varied range of applications, including:
1. Video tape editing. The monitor
can be used as a key unit in the design
of advanced video tape editing systems.
2. Surveillance. Closed-circuit TV sur-
veillance in industrial plant protection,
as a deterrent against shoplifting, and as
an aid in general law enforcement.
3. Sports. Quick determination of per-
tinent actions in sporting events by pro-
viding an instant frozen picture of race
finishes, winners, accidents and rules in-
fractions.
4. Teaching. Closed-circuit "on the
scene" TV classroom instruction. Ideal
for capturing pertinent moments in
demonstrations, thus permitting elabo-

24 hours, becomes dangerous. The sub-
ject suffers from hallucinations and other
symptoms due to it and the accompany-
ing boredom.
When a work-rest cycle was adopted
in conjunction with the isolation test,
the hallucinations were completely elimi-
nated, and the subjects were able to
stay in for a week or more at a time.
The cycle didn't combat fatigue very
well, because while the subject's effi-
ciency remained high in such things as
adding simple number combinations, hi:
proficiency in solving problems decreased
as time went on. The optimum dura-
tions for work and rest have yet to be
decided. While induced hibernation,
would reduce difficulties due to confine-
ment, loneliness and boredom, it would
also reduce his usefulness in space.
In the weightless state, it is believed
that man needs some "gravity" to re-
main happy. This may be in the form
of magnetic shoes, or straps on his chair
or bed so that there is at least some
restraint, and a feeling of being at rest
in relation to other objects.
The psychologists say that a man in
orbit around the earth should face in the
direction of travel with his feet toward
the earth to maintain some orientational
reference with the earth. The satellite
should not rotate more than a few de-
grees.
Due to darkness and silence, a pilot
will experience a sharply decreased sens-
ory input. It has been suggested thai
neurological stimuli received from the
viscera and skin which are too weak to
be heeded by the brain ordinarily would
compensate for the lack of the stronger
stimuli (sights, sounds) in space. Any
other undesirable psychological effect wi'I
be amplified and intensified by that often
uncontrollable human emotion, fear.
Some conclusions drawn from psycho-
logical research are:
1. Some physical activity is desirable—
ability to flex extremities, to change posi-
tion, to sit vertically seems to be a basic
requirement. A person feels content
knowing he has this ability, even if he
does not take continuous advantage of it.
2. A visual reference is needed, both
inside the vehicle and exterior to it.
Another requirement—ability to control
illumination.
3. A two-way voice communication
between the pilot and people on earth
who are as vitally interested in the suc-
cessful completion of the project as he
is would be very helpful.
4. Time orientation, time goals are
very important in space.
"). Ability to eat, sleep, carry out tasks
in a quasi-normal pattern will help a
space traveler stave off boredom and the
effects of it such as general mental
eccentricity.
Instrumentation
Scientists and doctors find it not too
difficult to interpret data, except when
there is none to interpret. The challenge
of space medicine is to devise possible
ways to get that information.

What's For You?
Reflections.
The field of instrumentation is ad-
vancing rapidly due in part to relatively
new skills of miniaturization using
printed circuits, transistors and the like.
Thus, it is easier to attach several in-
struments to a small animal such as a
monkey without injuring it.
The effects of radiation above the
earth will have to be investigated before
we risk a human life. We should:
1. Measure the flux density and the
energy distribution of heavy primary
particles (nuclei of elements of atomic
number greater than six) above the
earth's atmosphere. Some of this in-
formation has been received from bal-
loon flights and the radio-equipped satel-
lites.
2. Devise a physical way to monitor
primary cosmic hits in biological material.
3. Measure the Van Allen radiation
using more elaborate pulse scintillator
discriminator combinations.
4. Determine the type, quality and in-
tensity of the secondary radiation within
the space vehicle.
5. Relate intensities of the Van Allen
radiation more closely to time, latitude,
longitude.
The study of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
survivors, victims of nuclear accidents
and cancer patients undergoing X-ray
treatment provides some information on
hyperradiation. This can be supple-
mented by more general study of the
consequences of radiation applied to
plant and lower animal life.
Much of the data pertaining to the
X-15 flights will ultimately be used for
space travel. The effects of cosmic radia-
tion on X-15 pilots can be determined by
measuring what is called "whole bociv
radiation", the method consisting of a
gamma counter which records the amount
of radioactive potassium in striated mus-
cle tissue. The examination takes only
three minutes; then preflight and post-
flight levels are simply compared to ob-
tain a reading. The half-life of radio-
active potassium is 12.8 hours. A pilot's
radioactivity would normalize in about
three days.
A current data-gathering package in-
troduced by Wright Air Development
Center contains the following instru-
ments to transmit information from *
pilot's body to the ground: four differ-
ential electrocardiograph amplifiers, four
thermistor bridge circuits (temperature
gauges), one bridge circuit with tempera-
ture compensation for a heated-thermistor
type pneumotachometer (a respiration
counter), and two pressure transducer
bridges. Nine channels convey physiolog-
ical information and the other two con-
cern the environment. The eleven oscillo
graphs are continuously and simultane-
ously telemetered to the groung during
test flights.

This plastic bubble protects the antenna of a
radically new aerial three-dimensional radar
defense system.
Sensitive to the inadequacies of conventional radar
systems, engineers at Hughes in Fullerton devised
a radar antenna whose pointing direction is made
sensitive to the frequency of the electromagnetic
energy applied to the antenna. This advanced tech-
nique allows simultaneous detection of range, bear-
ing and altitude...with a single antenna.
Hughes engineers combined this radar antenna with
"vest-pocket sized" data processors to co-ordinate
antiaircraft missile firing. These unique data proc-
essing systems provide:
1. Speed —Complex electronic missile firing data was
designed to travel through the system in milli-
seconds, assuring "up-to-date" pinpoint position-
ing of hostile aircraft.
2. Mobility —Hughes engineers "ruggedized" and
miniaturized the system so that it could be mounted
into standard army trucks which could be de-
ployed to meet almost any combat problem—even
in rugged terrain.
3. Reliability — By using digital data transmission
techniques, Hughes engineers have greatly re-
duced any possibility of error.
Result: the most advanced electronics defense
system in operation!


Other Hughes projects provide similarly stimulating
outlets for creative talents. Current areas of Re-
search and Development include advanced airborne
electronics systems, advanced data processing
systems, electronic display systems, molecular elec-
tronics, space vehicles, nuclear electronics, electrolu-
minescence, ballistic missiles...and many more.

... as you consider your first professional job.
At Melpar, we believe that all young engineers
and scientists should develop the habit of looking
beyond the obvious.
First, what is the obvious? It's obvious that
you're in demand. You don't have to worry about
getting your material wants satisfied. And you
don't have to worry about getting opportunities
for professional growth. Since you are in demand,
you can expect to get the things you want from
any number of potential employers.
But, if you look beyond the obvious, you'll real-
ize now that you're going to want something more
than "want satisfaction" out of your career.
You're going to want pride—pride in your per-
sonal, individual contribution.
At Melpar, where we are now working on 120
advanced defense and space exploration projects,
we are interested only in young men who realize
that pride is a reward that extends much beyond
the obvious. Because Melpar is a proud Company.
We're proud of our IMAGINEERING approach
to the solution of electronic problems; we're proud
of our uninterrupted growth and controlled expan-
sion; we're proud of the communities that sur-
round our laboratories and plants in Northern
Virginia and Boston, and we're proud of our cre-
ation, design, and production of electronic prod-
ucts destined for universal application.
If you want an opportunity to be proud of your
contribution and your Company, we're interested
in hearing from you. Tell us about yourself.
Either ask your college's Placement Director to
arrange a personal interview with the Melpar
representative who will be visiting your campus, or
write to our Professional Employment Supervisor.
Tell him if you would like to hear from one of
your college's graduates who is now progressing

compared to the power devoted to the
intelligence bearing signals. The gener-
ation of the needed power for the carrier
requires heavy duty power supplies and
generally adds to the expense of the
transmitter. Keeping in mind that only
one fourth of the total output power of
an A.M. signal is contained in one side
band, it is seen that if the carrier and
one sideband is eliminated, the same
message-carrying capability is obtained
while using only one fourth of the orig-
inal power. In other words, the effective
power output of a S.S.B. transmitter is
four times as great as an A.M. trans-
mitter of the same power.
Interference Reduced
If an A.M. radio transmitter is broad-
casting a simple 1,000 cycle tone, the
minimum frequency spectrum which it
would occupy would be 2,000 cycles.
This, you will remember, can be seen
from our picture of an A.M. signal as
two signals occuring at frequencies
"alongside the carrier." This is actually
quite a "chunk" of the total frequency
band to be occupied by only one signal.
Furthermore, if two different carriers fall
near each other in the spectrum they will
"beat" against each other much as a
carrier "beats" against its sidebands. A
tone whose frequency is equal to the
difference in frequencies of the carriers
will be heard. This is called "heterodyn-


This single sideband receiver with CW and AM is typical of such amateur receivers.
It is capable of coverage of the entire spectrum between 3.5 and 30 megacycles.
ing" and is a very troublesome sort of
interference found wherever amplitude
modulation is employed. Since the carrier
and one sideband are not present in a
single-sideband signal, it occupies less
space in the spectrum. Also there are no
carriers to "heterodyne" each other if
the signals fall close together in the fre-
quency spectrum. Claims that some meth-
ods of A.M. result in narrower signals are
false. The basic theory of radiotelephony
refutes this assertion. All of these facts
point to the conclusion that S.S.B. sig-
nals are far less subject to interference
than are A.M. signals.
USAF Tests
Tests conducted by the United States
Air Force show that S.S.B. signals are
more intelligible at a distance than are
A.M. signals. Single words were sent by
both systems and copied at the receiving
station by trained listeners. Ninety per
cent of the S.S.B. signals were above
60% intelligible. Ninety percent of the
This self contained single sideband sta-
tion has an output of 100 watts on any
of four pretuned channels. It may be
operated by non-technical personnel.
A.M. signals were only above 30% in-
telligible. Maximum single word intel-
ligibility showed a score of 78% for
S.S.B. compared to 60% for AM. Be-
cause of this proven ability to resist in-
terference, almost every Strategic Air
Command plane is equipped with S.S.B.
The Strategic Air Command's command-
er, in explaining this installation, said,
"Communication is synonymous with
command. If I don't have communica-
tions, the only weapon I have is my
desk—and I can't throw it very far, and
it's not very lethal."
In spite of the decided advantages of
single-sideband, there are certain disad-
vantages which should be mentioned. In
general, the S.S.B. system is more compli-
cated than the standard A.M. system. As
a result, it takes more skill on the part
of the operator to maintain and operate
the equipment properly. The equipment
must also be manufactured to more rig-
orous specifications, since both the trans-
mitter and the receiver must have ex-
tremely good frequency stability charac-
teristics. However, the advantages seem
to far outweigh the disadvantages, and
perhaps someday single-sideband will be-
come the "standard" mode of commun-
ication.

At time (t) equals zero there lived in
a small cavity in a dielectric a poor strug-
gling dipole by the name of Eddy Cur-
rent. He was deeply in love with a
beauteous double layer by the name of
Anne Ion, the daughter of an influential
force in the town, Cat Ion. Anne was
the center of attraction of the young
dipoles of the town; her golden curls,
her symmetric line integrals, and her
harmonic motion affected the suscepti-
bilities of all the gay sparks. Howevei,
her father, a rich magnet and power
factor, had laid down a strict set of
boundary conditions for her future hus-
band. Eddy's first contact with her came
at tiiiv" (t) equals a. As he passed by
a beauty parlor on his periodic orbit,
he saw her have a standing wave in-
duced in her filaments. He made a tine
sight in his beautiful doublet and it was
a case of mutual polarization.

There on the Wheatstone Bridge the

be happy without you."
"O, Eddy don't be so obtuse," said
Anne. "Integrate out here in the alpha

"Anne, are you trying to damp my
oscillations? Can't you see I'm in a state
of hysteresis over you?"
"Now Eddy, be a discreet particle.
What will father say?"
Eddy did not allow her reluctance to
phase him, for he knew it was only a

surface charge. "I admit I only get paid
a low calorie in my present position but
I have potentialities and I'm sure money
can't BTU of any importance compared
to my love."
Alas, there was also in this cavity a
mean dipole who was resolved to marry
Anne, using coercive force if necessary.

The word space commonly represents the outer, airless regions of the universe.
But there is quite another kind of "space" close at hand, a kind that will always
challenge the genius of man.
This space can easily be measured. It is the space-dimension of cities and the
distance between them ... the kind of space found between mainland and off-
shore oil rig, between a tiny, otherwise inaccessible clearing and its supply
base, between the site of a mountain crash and a waiting ambulance—above all,
Sikorsky is concerned with the precious "spaceway" that currently exists be-
tween all earthbound places.
Our engineering efforts are directed toward a variety of VTOL and STOL
aircraft configurations. Among earlier Sikorsky designs are some of the most
versatile airborne vehicles now in existence; on our boards today are the ve-

'eane Keuch, one of 136 Dunham-Bush sales
engineers, knows the advantages of being associated with a
dynamic young company with extensive product lines.
Following his engineering studies at Purdue, Deane joined
Dunham-Bush as a trainee and soon became an application
engineer. After a relatively short time he was assigned his own
territory, working out of the Cleveland area sales office.
In calling on consulting engineers, architects, plant engineers,
wholesalers, contractors and building owners, Deane (like all
Dunham-Bush sales engineers) finds it reassuring to be backed by
his area office and the facilities of Dunham-Bush laboratories.
Equally reassuring is the availability of complete lines. The range
of Dunham-Bush refrigeration products runs from compressors
to complete systems; the range of air conditioning products
extends from motel room conditioners to a hospital's entire air
conditioning plant. The heating line is equally complete: from a
radiator valve to zone heating control for an entire apartment
housing project. The Dunham-Bush product family even includes
specialized heat transfer products applicable to missile use.

photo-electric plethysmograph (a device
that registers the change in size of an
organ or a limb and hence, the amount
of blood occurring there), a polarograph-
ic element sensing the partial pressure
of oxygen in respiratory gases, and 3
one-transistor recorder of transient skin
response. The latter would eliminate the
confusion of slow changes or normal
changes in skin resistance and woulc
record only those physiological responses
to discrete stimuli.
Simulation
AH the conditions of space flight ex-
cept zero gravity and ionizing radiation
can be simulated on earth. Those of
take-off and re-entry, acceleration, oscilla-
tion, spinning or tumbling, noise, heat,
and hypobaria can be approximated by
a centrifuge, cabin on three free axes
gimbals, vibrator under seat, tape re-
cording, heat elements in the walls, and
vacuum pumps. Conditions in space:
heat, cold, hypobaria, rotation, darkness,
confinement, low sensory inputs, and in-
finite heat sink can be simulated by an
artificial sun, air conditioners, turntable,
vacuum pumps, insulation, refrigeration,
and blackened walls. Some work has
been done on acceleration using the
high-speed rocket sled. Col. John Stapp
endured 42g's when the sled in which
he was traveling at 632 miles an hour
stopped in 1.5 seconds.
The psychologist, for his part, must
make up tests for the pilot which lie
will be interested enough in to perform
during the flight, whether it is simulated,
test or actual orbiting. The classic per-
formance tests would probably be ig-
nored under those circumstances.
Researchers hope not to be taken by
surprise by anything a venture into space
will hold. They hope that they will have
prepared for every contingency when
the count-down begins. But it will be
impossible to be absolutely sure until
the first man successfully completes a
flight into space . . . and lives to tell
about it.

lost sight of the UFO and later received
word that Mantell had crashed and was
dead.*
Professor Menzel's explanation of the
encounter declared that Mantell was
chasing a "mock sun," caused by ice
crystals in cirrus clouds higher than Man-
tell's plane could safely reach. Since the
aircraft was not equipped with oxygen,
Menzel theorized that Mantell went above
his limit, blacked out, lost control of the
F-51, and subsequently crashed.
The interplanetary advocates reported
that a few of Mantell's plane fragments
had strange grooves in the metal, and
more revealing, a high measure of radio-
activity caused perhaps by an intense
wake of discharging atom-forced radia-
tion energy from the huge object.5 The
Air Force strongly denied these reports.
At the time of the Mantell incident,
the ATIC UFO project was involved in
a series of shifts in policy because of
changes in leadership. First, the group
adopted an "explain them all away"
attitude and later returned to an honest
attempt at reaching unbiased conclusions.
For example, it was first announced by
the Air Force that Mantell was killed
while chasing the planet Venus. At cer-
tain times of the year, this particular
planet becomes bright enough to be mis-
taken as a foreign object approaching
the earth. The Air Force stated that
Mantell had climbed toward Venus until
he became unconscious from insufficient
oxygen. Later, after a more thorough
investigation, it was determined that
Venus could not have been bright enough
to confuse an experienced pilot. It was
also learned that a giant 100-foot diame-
ter "skyhood" balloon, sent aloft in
Minnesota for gathering weather data,
might possibly have been in the Godman
field area on that day and that it may
have been the huge object. This was the
solution finally decided upon by Project
Blue Book.
Chasing "Saucers" Over the Capital
It was in July of 1952, that the "flying
saucer" report, which won more world
attention than any other, hit the head-
lines in our nation's capital. At 11:40
p.m., July 19, the two radar sets at Wash
ington Nationl Airport picked up eight
unidentified targets. They were not ordi-
nary aircraft because they would loaf at
100 to 130 miles per hour and then
suddenly accelerate to fantastically high
speeds and leave the area. During the
night, crews of several airliners saw
mysterious lights in the same locations
that the radar pin-pointed the targets.
Tower operators also saw lights, and jet
fighters were dispatched, but the uncanny
lights seemed to be able to anticipate
the fighters' every movement and the ob-
jects were always gone before the jets
could "close."
The morning's headlines were "Inter-
ceptors Chase Flying Saucers Over Wash-
ington, D. C!" The two radar sets at
Washington National Airport were
checked and found in perfect working
order. One set was located in the con-
trol tower and the other, a long-range
radar set controlling the air lanes for
miles around, was located in the Air
Route Traffic Control Center.
A week later, the mysterious objects
again appeared. One UFO was clocked
at 7,000 miles per hour; other objects
flew through the prohibited flying are;-
over the White House and Capitol. Air-
liners were followed to within a few
miles of touchdown on the runways.
Ninety degree turns at high speeds were
executed repeatedly. Interceptors were
again called and just as the jets ap-
proached the area, the targets disappeared
off the scopes. The jets flew around for
awhile, saw nothing, and left the Wash-
ington area. In a few minutes, the un-
identified objects were back on the radar
scopes. Another jet was contacted and
this time the pilot saw a light and
started toward it, but suddenly it went
out, "as though a light bulb had been
turned off." The pilot and his radar ob-
server continued the run and a radar
lockon was established, but it was soon
broken. Two more lockons were ob-
tained but also broken after a few sec-
onds. During this time, people all over
the area were calling in that weird,
bright lights were being seen.'"'
It was not easy to find a reasonable
solution. Those who felt there was a
solution finally based their arguments on
temperature inversions. An inversion
occurs when the layer of air nearest the
surface of the earth becomes warmer
with increasing height. During such an
abnormal situation, this warmer air may
occur up to a height of 100 meters or
so. Above this height the temperature
decreases with higher altitudes. These
conflicting masses of air may cause radar
waves to be reflected resulting in a false
indication of positions of objects either
in the air or on the ground.
The believers in alien space travelers
did not buy this theory. It was easily
proved that in Washington, D.C. through
the months of June, July, and August
there was hardly a day that passed with-
out a temperature inversion. Therefore,
they reasoned, why did not fake targets
show up more often instead of just on
these very few occasions? And, if true,
how could these fake targets so shrewdly
maneuver when about to be pursued?
Project Blue Book was, of course,
pushed very hard for an answer in its
investigation of the Capitol incident.
This incident had probably aroused more
people in high governmental positions
than previous sightings, people who
had once laughed off the whole saucer
affair. The inversion theory was thor-
oughly investigated, but the one im-
pressive factor was the high caliber of
the people involved in the Washington
incident. Radar men in positions of air-
50
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


craft control deal with human lives and
are assigned accordingly. There can be
no error in their work and they are
chosen after rigorous training, supervi-
sion, and investigation. These men were
well qualified, experienced radar men
who brought thousands of people into
Washington National Airport every day.
Such responsible men could be expected
to know the difference between a real
target and a weather target. ATIC still
considers the Washington, D.C. sight-
ings as unknowns.
The Future Probability
These were only a few of the many
hundreds of qualified UFO reports. The
people who saw these strange occurrences,
who investigated the reports and who
engaged in the controversy in explaining
them were of the highest caliber. Airline
pilots, scientists, professors and many
others of the utmost reliability saw and
reported UFO sightings. The number of
unexplained sightings is great enough
to cause much speculation. There is no
tangible proof that space ships from
other planets exist, but the possibilities
are fascinating, and as time passes, their
existence becomes more and more proba-
ble. Perhaps some day we will know the
true answer to the '"flying saucer" ques-
tion. And as some believe, it may be one
of the greatest events that has happened
to man.

Karl Pearson... on mystery versus ignorance
"Does science leave no mystery? On the contrary,
it proclaims mystery where others profess knowl-
edge. There is mystery enough in the universe
of sensation and in its capacity for containing
those little corners of consciousness which project
their own products, of order and law and reason,
into an unknown and unknowable w7orId. There
is mystery enough here, only let us clearly distin-
guish it from ignorance within the field of possible
knowledge. The one is impenetrable, the other
we are daily subduing."

Take advantage of the
MECHANICAL
ADVANTAGE
The screw is a combination of two
mechanical principles: the lever,
and the inclined plane in helical
form. The leverage applied to the
nut combines with motion of the nut
around the bolt to exert tremendous
clamping force between the two.
One of the greatest design errors
today, in fact, is failure to realize
the mechanical advantages that
exist in standard nuts and bolts.
Smaller diameters and less costly
grades of fasteners tightened to
their full capacity will create far
stronger joints than those utilizing
bigger and stronger fasteners tight-
ened to only a fraction of their
capacity. Last year, one of our engi-
neers showed a manufacturer how
he could save $97,000 a year simply
by using all the mechanical advan-
tages of a less expensive grade.
When you graduate, make sure
you consider the mechanical advan-
tages that RBaW fasteners provide.
And make sure, too, that you con-
sider the career advantages RBaW
offers mechanical engineers-in the

of mechanical fasteners. If you're

TECHNIC TEASERS
(1) A psychologist places a white
rat in a box. On each of the opposite
wails of the box there is a hole just
large enough for the rat to stick his head
through. The rat is taught to run from
one wall to the other. As soon as it
reaches one wall, it sticks its head
through the hole, then runs to the op-
posite wall and sticks his head through
the second hole. At the start, it takes
the rat one minute to get from one wall
to the opposite one. The return trip,
however, consumes half a minute. The
next trip requires only one-fourth ot
a minute, the next one-eighth of a min-
ute, and so on. Every time the rat make^
a trip, the following trip requires half
the time consumed for the previous trip.
This goes on indefinitely. Theoretically,
how long will it take the rat to have it»
head sticking out of both holes at the
same time?
(2) Three men, A, B, and C, evenly
spaced on a circular track in that order,
start walking around the track in the
same direction. A walking toward B,
etc. A overtakes B in 15 minutes and
requires an additional 5 minutes to over-
take C. How soon does B overtake C?
(3) A lottery sells ten tickets and
offers three prizes. What is the chance
of winning a prize with three tickets?
(4) Professor Matthews was asked
by a student, "How old are you?"
"Well," he replied, "how old are
you?"
When the student gave his age, Mat-
thews said, "When I was as old as you
are now, I was nine times as old as you
were. However, in seven years our com-
bined ages will be 92."
How old were the professoor and his
student?
(5) A car is traveling at 60 miles
per hour before going up an inclined
plane which rises at the rate of 10 feer
per 100 feet. The driver keeps the gas
pedal in a constant position. At the top
of the incline the car shoots into space.
The incline is 1000 feet long (horizon-
tally) and the car is a 1926 Buick. This
model of Buick has a weight equal to
20 times its horsepower which is equal
to one-half its displacement which, when
divided by the number of wheels (in-
cluding the spare and steering wheel)
equals 1200. The ground, starting at the
end of the incline and at a level equal
to that at the beginning of the incline,
drops at the rate of 10 feet per 100 feet
of horizontal distance.
How far from the end of the incline
will the car travel before it hits the
ground?
(6) A young lady who taught math
in a high school was supplementing her
income by helping to take the census.
As she came to a certain house, she rang
the bell, and, as she did so, noted the
house number and wrote it in her book.
An old man came to the door.
"What do you want?" he asked.
"I am the census taker, sir. Please
answer some questions."
"Go away!"
"Well, at least please tell me your
age," she persuaded.
He told her and she wrote the figure
in her book.
'"Now, sir, how many other people
live here besides yourself?"
"Three others. Now go away!"
"What are the ages of the three other
people?"
"Enough of this foolishness. You fig-
ure it out. The three ages added to-
gether make the house number. Multi-
ply them together, and you get 1296."
The census taker pondered this for a
moment and wrote some figures in the
back of the book.
"Tell me," she asked, "are any of
the other three people older than you?"
"Yes."
"Thank you very much, sir. That will
be all. Goodbye," she said as she wrote
the ages in her book.
"Go away!" the man responded
pleasantly as he slammed the door.
Now assuming that the ages are in-
tegral, and not in excess of 100 years,
can you figure out what they are, and
also the house number? You should also
find the approximate age of the person
giving the information.

(1) We do not know how many
trips will be required to accomplish the
feat of sticking one head out of the
holes in the opposite walls at the same
time, but it is a safe assumption that the
number, say N, will be large. The sum
of the N terms of the geometric pro-
gression: 1, 1/2* ^4» Va&gt; etc- 's
i x (y2)N - i
i/2 - i
For N sufficiently large, the quantity
(V2.)N becomes small enough to be the-
oretically dropped from the expression,
which then becomes 1/(1 — y2), or ex-
actly two minutes.
(2) Since the circumference of the
circle is ird, the distance between A and
B, B and C, and so on, is tt/3. If X
represents the distance B travels in 15
minutes, then A travels X X v/3 in
the same time. The rates (in units per
minute) of A and B are therefore X/15
-)-7r/45 and X/15, respectively. In 20
minutes A will go a distance of 4X. 3-)-
4tt/9, and in this same amount of time
C will go a distance of 4X 3-f 4:rd9—
2,rd/3, or 4X/3+4,rd/9 — 2,rd/3, or
4X/3 — 2 Vd9, which gives C the rate
of X/15 — ^d/90. Since the rate of B
is rrd/90 greater than the rate of C. B
will overtake C in (jrd/3)/(rrd/90), or
30 minutes.
(3) The favorable cases are: 1 prize
and two blanks: 2 prizes and 1 blank;
and 3 prizes and no blanks. 1 prize and
2 blanks can be drawn in 3 X (7 X 6)
/2 = 63 ways; 2 prizes and one blank
can be drawn in (3 X 2)/2 X 7 =
21 ways; and 3 prizes and no blanks
can be drawn in one way. Then the
total number of ways of drawing one
or more prizes is 63 + 21 -\- 1, or 85.
The total number of ways of drawing
3 tickets out of 10 tickets is (10 X 9
X 8)/3 X 2 X 1). or 120. Then
the chance of winning a prize is 85/120,
or 17/24.

From this we obtain the equation

(5) The car traveled approximately
94 feet from the foot of the incline be-
fore it struck the ground.

battles (eg. World War III). Even
today, in this country, the courts have
had cases brought before them because
weather modification in one area caused
supposed negligent damage in another
area. To see why a Third World War
might start over weather modification,
one must look back at the projects men-
tioned.
Suppose Russia did build dams and
artificial lakes in Siberia and also started
to melt the polar icecap. This would
raise the temperature in the Arctic area
to an extent that winds blowing across
the central United States, coming from
that region, would be much warmer than
usual. Since part of the icecap would be
melted, a proportional rise in the level
of the sea must be expected and the
lower level of New York's skyscrapers,
most of Florida and the Mississippi Val-
ley would be flooded. If these things
happened, one can be sure of strong
protests from this country. If Russia were
allowed to build the dam across the Ber-
ing Straits and the Japanese Current were
diverted, then the Pacific coast of this
country would have an even warmer
climate than it now enjoys.
A problem involving the whole world
in a different respect than mentioned be-
fore is the melting of the polar icecap.
This would leave an ice-free open arctic
and warm Atlantic currents moving
steadily through the 1,100-mile gap be-
tween Greenland and Norway, would
contribute immense masses of water vapor
to the polar atmosphere. This in turn
would lead to great snowstorms on the
Eurasian and North American shores ol
the Arctic, and to the formation of con
tinent blanketing ice sheets. Thus man,
rather than nature, would be the cause
of the next ice age.
Thus one can see that changing the
weather in any one place might be dis-
astrous to the whole world. That is why
the author mentioned in the second para-
graph of this article that man may be
capable of controlling the weather in the
future . . . but might not want to do so.
Until that time that man can control the
weather safely, hold on to your um-
brellas!!!

Cover Story
"Special Issue" on the cover means
just that. The "Michigan Technic" has
devoted this entire issue to "Our Chang-
ing Cities." Such problems as city plan-
ning, downtown blight, slum clearance,
traffic congestion, and the mushrooming
suburbs are all considered. This month's
cover artist, Jim Berson, has attempted
to convey some of these aspects through
his cover sketch depicting the transition
from the busy downtown district through
the dreary slum areas and finally to the
growing suburbs.

Waltz Mill Experimental Reactor helps
Westinghouse engineers solve problems
The new Westinghouse Testing Reactor at Waltz Mill,
Pa., provides engineers with complete facilities for an-
alyzing the effect of nuclear radiation on various mate-
rials, processes and designs. If a Westinghouse engineer
is working on development of atomic fuels or the design
of reactor components for an atomic power plant, he
can count on help from the men at Waltz Mill.
The Westinghouse Testing Reactor is one of only two
such privately owned reactors in the country. It pro-
vides a high radiation field comparable to that of a
working reactor, and in addition has special controlled
environment loops for the study of radiation effects at
high temperatures and pressures. Work presently being
carried out here for other departments of the company
includes studies of thermionics, crystal structure, and
thermoelectric effects as well as the work on atomic
reactor designs and fuels.
The young engineer at Westinghouse isn't expected
to know all the answers . . . our work is often too ad-
vanced for that. Instead, his abilities and knowledge are
backed up by specialists like those at Waltz Mill.
If you have ambition and ability, you can have a
rewarding career with Westinghouse. Our broad product
line, decentralized operations, and diversified technical
assistance provide hundreds of challenging opportuni-
ties for talented engineers.

DOW" is tomorrow-minded
product
Publishing a complete list of Dow products—all 700
odd of them—is an elusive project. By the time such
a list was off the press, new names would have to be
added to bring the list up to date. The reason: develop-
ment of new products is the order of the day at Dow,
every day of the working year.
These new products are developed to meet the needs
of the many industries Dow serves. Today's problems
in manufacturing and processing must be solved, and,
as these industries advance, new chemicals and materials
will be needed to implement tomorrow's technology. At
Dow, research and development aim at anticipating
these future needs . . . thus a "tomorrow-minded"
attitude toward products is always evident.
The product group of Dow Agricultural Chemicals, for
example, has expanded manyfold in recent years
through a vigorous research and developmental pro-
gram. In the early '50's it consisted of two or three
products. Today it includes many varieties of weed
killers, fertilizers, fumigants, insecticides, feed additives
and animal health aids. A new crab grass killer has
recently made its debut, first in a series of new "ag
chem" products slated for the homeowner market.
Dow's work in automotive chemistry is typical of the
"tomorrow-minded" attitude. Dow currently supplies
a number of chemicals and plastics materials to auto
makers—latex-based metal primers, antifreeze, uphol-
stery materials and brake fluids, to name a few. But a
quick tour through Dow's two Automotive Chemicals
Laboratories would reveal that Dow will be ready with
the right chemicals and plastics for the job, no matter
which way future automotive design goes! One under
development, for example, is a chemical that cools the
engine by continuous boiling.
One of the most outstanding success stories at Dow is
that of Separan10, a product developed to fit into
industry's future. This chemical is a flocculant, or
"settler" of solids in solution. Perhaps "super floc-
culant" would be a better description because Separan
takes minutes to do jobs that formerly took days.
Introduced in 1955, it has gained widespread recognition
in mining, pulp and paper and other industries.
In such a climate of creativity and tomorrow-minded-
ness, new opportunities at Dow are constantly opening
up for people who have their eyes—and their thoughts
—on the future. If you'd like to know more about the
Dow opportunity, please write: Director of College
Relations, Department 2426FW, the dow chemical
company, Midland, Michigan.

"Every student must take at least half bis courses in liberal
arts. Required of all are stiff, one-year courses in English literature
and rhetoric, history and development of Western civilization, his-
tory and philosophy of science, and a study of contemporary non-
western cultures. . . .
Students in engineering science will get a broad background of
mathematics, chemistry and physics and some specialties sucb as
mechanics and electronics. With the heavy schedule in liberal arts,
they will be prepared as broadly trained men able to direct massive
combinations of men and materials in engineering and scientific
problems not even dreamed of today."
(Michigan Daily, February 14, I960)
The above statement is the result of a series of unique dis-
cussions—the Meadow Brook Seminars—between twenty-eight
authorities in the fields of liberal arts, engineering, business, and
teacher education. The purpose of these seminars was the creation
of a new institution of higher learning—Michigan State University-
Oakland.
Of particular interest is a seminar that took place in Meadow
Brook Hall on the site of the new campus on August 16, 1958. Six
of the nation's leading engineering educator's were present to answer
the following question:1
"With your knowledge and experience in the field of
engineering education, how would you organize a program
in engineering science at this new institution to train en-
gineers for the half century ahead of us?"-
The answer the panel gave to this question, along with the
answers given by other panels in liberal arts, business, and teacher
education resulted in MSU-O as typified by the opening paragraph.
Of special interest to us, as engineers, is the result of the seminar
on engineering, not because we are suggesting that Michigan adopt
a similar plan, but because of the insight it gives us into the role
of engineers and engineering in the last half of the twentieth cen-
tury.
First the group concluded that engineering schools have been
doing a good job in general and must continue to do so, but that in
the future "there needs to be added new dimensions (in engineer-
ing education) if the challenge of the future is to be met with
success." Today engineers are working on large and complicated
"projects" compared with the "jobs" of years ago. This and other
changes in our society mean that engineers more frequently will
have to "have some knowledge of, and be able to communicate
with, the practitioners of law, of finance, and of politics." In other
words, while the engineer must be increasingly adept in his field,
he must be broad enough to handle himself in other elements of
society.
The Meadow Brook group felt that not one, but three types
of "engineers" will be needed to meet the challenge of the future.
The first group comprises the majority of engineering graduates,
the ones who take an idea in rough form and apply it to produce
the cars, planes and missies of today. Second is the "technician," a

type being graduated in greater numbers each year from technical
institutions and junior colleges. Third is the group termed the
"innovators and directors" which is what MSU-O hopes to produce
three years hence. According to the experts it is this group—which
will get a background of 35% natural sciences and math, 20%
social-humanities, and 45% engineering at MSU-O—who will
direct and initiate the complex engineering projects in the years
to come. But even if this category includes only a small group, it
is still true that the majority of engineers will find their jobs be-
coming increasingly complex as they relinquish many of their
duties to the technician and move on to higher intellectual planes.
As pointed out before, we are not suggesting, nor was the
Meadow Brook group, that Michigan or any other school adopt the
MSU-O plan or a similar one. Yet the conclusions and recom-
mendations made by these educators remain important to us, for
they preview the responsibilities and limitations of the engineer in
the next half-century.
According to the Meadow Brook conclusions, if our role is
to be an integral significant part of the future, we must be "extreme-
ly able men who are well educated liberally, scientifically, math-
ematically, and as engineering scientists."
Will we be able to meet this criterion?

Of more than passing interest on campus recently has been
the fine job being done by the Institute of Science and Technology
to stimulate and raise the level of scientific thinking at Michigan.
Although only in its first year of operation, 1ST has sponsored, or
is sponsoring, lecture series on Space Astrophysics, Guidance and
Control Vehicles, and the Molecular Control of Cellular Activity.
Through the efforts of 1ST nearly 50 distinquished authorities
—including at least two Nobel prize winners—from all parts of the
United States as well as Sweden, England, West Germany, and the
Netherlands, will have spoken here by the end of the year.
A glance at the titles of the various lectures indicates that they
should go a long way in stimulating scientific thought among facul-
ty, grad students and upperclassmen. If these lectures are indica-
tions of things to come we can be sure 1ST is going to be around for
a long time to come.

Reading Bernard Stollman's article in this issue on transpor-
tation problems in today's cities brings to mind the transportation
problem in the Fishbowl and the surrounding "passageways" in
Angell Hall. For an engineer on his first venture past West Engine,
it is quite a shock to battle his way through this "Lit School para-
dise," hopefully trying to make it in ten minutes. It seems that a
little bit of thought somewhere could eliminate this bottleneck.
A recent report from the Engineering Manpower Commission
brings some bad news—or good, depending on your viewpoint. If
you are graduating in the next couple of years it is probably good
news to hear that engineering enrollment dropped 11% in 1958
and 4% in 1959. But from a broader point of view these statistics
may be a bad omen for the country as a whole, especially in the
light of the 'missle gap" that apparently is widening.

WHY THIS SPECIAL ISSUE?
If we may define engineering as the
art which renders the truth of science useful
to the happiness of men, then the American
City and her future are of vital concern to
the engineer ... herein are found machines
and men en masse ... we achieve our goals
as engineers only when they are in har-
mony.
Will the city become a battlefield in
the struggle between man and his works:
his roads, machines ... or can the master
tame his serving-men? This is the question
that this special issue seeks to probe . . .

FACE
TOMORROW
Home to millions, center of commerce, focal
point of industry, the city is one of the bastions
of our social and economic life. But all is not
well with our metropolitan areas. Old age,
malignant suburban growth, and hardening of
the traffic arteries are but a few of the many
ills with which they are afflicted. Will these
maladies be fatal? It will be largely up to the
engineers to be "urban surgeons" and restore
the patient's vigor.
by BERNARD STOLLMAN
Next to language, Lewis Mumford
has pointed out, man's greatest
work of art is the city. Compared with
the city, the other forms of art are mere-
ly subsidiary. The city represents "the
point of maximum concentration for the
power and culture of a community." As
such, it represents the human condition
in a fuller sense than does any other of
man's varied achievements. Small wonder,
then, that city planners, sociologists,
economists, and occasionally even busi-
nessmen, recently have begun clamoring
for greater progress in rectifying the
city's rapidly worsening problems. The
tremendous population expansion within
the last fifteen years, combined with the
almost inhuman progress in technology,
has put America's cities in the most
dangerous situation they have yet en-
countered.
The great cities of America are dis-
integrating; they are being dismantled
and reassembled in a fashion contrary to
human needs and desires. Though city
planning agencies have been in operation
for twenty to thirty years in some of the
largest metropolitan centers in the United
States, only in the last few years has it
become obvious that the basic assump-
tions of city planners have been, to a
large extent, incorrect. The central core
of the city is being destroyed—that area
which has always been the crux or focus
of the city. It may well be asserted that
the destruction of that focus is synony-
mous with the destruction of the city
itself, no matter how great the popula-
tion of the surrounding suburbs.
Today, the city is becoming the home
of the very poor or the very wealthy; it
has little to attract the middle-income
group. This is essentially where the city
fails. Public housing is being provided
for the lower-income group; the wealthy
class have fashionable downtown apart-
ments. It is in the suburbs, in the giant
subdivisions of anonymous rows of
houses, that the middle-income group
has found what it desires. The city can-
not continue to exist as a healthy, vigor-
ous, democratic institution if it cannot
sustain a middle class. Some type of sub-
sidy or other inducement must close this
gap in the in-city sociological pattern if
the middle class is to be brought back
from the suburbs.

do not qualify for public housing and
cannot afford suburban housing. These
people remain in the city, or on the
fringes of the city, always one step ahead
of the slums. Some form of subsidized
housing again seems to be the answer
Modern rehabilitation projects are be-
ing planned or are under way all across
the nation. Unfortunately, most of these
projects are an outgrowth of a theory
formulated in the late nineteenth century,
one which has long been misunderstood.
The "garden city" idea was presented
in England in 1899 by Ebenezer Howard.
It represented an attempt to break up the
large city into a group of smaller com-
munities, providing a life close to nature
but retaining the industrial and social
amenities of the large cities. In the 1920's
and 1930s Clarence Stein carried these
ideas even further. He built communities
such as Radburn, New Jersey, based on
the ideas of Howard. Le Corbusier, the
great French architect, changed the "gar-
den city" by replacing the small buildings
»ilh skyscrapers. This increased the popu-
lation density sufficiently so that the
'garden city" concept became adaptable
to the city itself, not only the suburban
fringes.
By far the best solution to high-den-
sity urban housing is a mixture ot high-
rise and low-rise buildings, a combination
of the ideas of Howard and Le Corbusier.
Yet these plans do not solve the city's
problem. Planners have forgotten that
planning, like architecture, is a matter
of shaping space. In rural areas the space
surrounds the building; in urban loca-
tions the building should surround the
space. The "garden city" concept tends
to encourage urban buildings that are
surrounded by space, making it difficult
to achieve sucessfully the high densities
required for the core of the city. Besides,
these projects are usually out of the hu-
man scale. Public housing tends to be
made up of monolithic slabs that compare
more closely with prison blocks than
with living quarters for free individuals.
Housing developments of this sort
are doing more harm than good. They
are destroying the core of the city, the
vital center of cultural and social oppor-
tunities. Nathan Glazer, co-author with
David Riesmann of "The Lonely Crowd"
pertinently observes that this destruction
occurs when planners are planning for
suburbs, not cities. By replacing slums
with public housing, planners have also
destroyed what value these slums had. The
stimulus for poets and politicians, of
coffee houses, grocery stores, store-front
churches, radical political headquarters,
etc., has been removed. "The greater the
suburbanization of the city, the weaker
the city's core has grown."
The value of the core of the city lies
chiefly in its heterogeneity. The variety
of stores, of types of housing, and most
of all, the variety of people, makes the
city the most interesting and easily the
most rewarding place to live. Suburbia,
as it has evolved, is a place of tiresome
repetition. Subdivisions consisting of hun-
dreds of identical homes have produced
neighborhoods of identical people—peo-
ple with the same income, number of
children, interests, and values. At the
same time, suburbia has separated itself
from the cultural centers. It may require
onl) half an hour to drive to the center
of the city, yet suburbanites tend to feel
cut off from the city and make little use
of the amenities offered there. Because
of its very nature, suburbia can never
attain the cultural and social advantages
that are offered by the city. Once they
are not available in the city, they will
nr&gt;t be available anywhere.
A look at the layouts of streets and
homes in Riverside, a suburb of Chicago,
indicates how little original thinking has
been done in subdivision planning in the
last hundred years. Riverside was de-
signed in 1869 with a gracefully curving
pattern of streets, carefully alternating
parks, open spaces and housing. Today's
subdivisions are no improvement over
Riverside. If anything, the streets are far
less graceful, the parks missing. Subdi-
viders have no desire to let the natural
contours of the land determine the final
topography of the subdivision. Usually
the land is reduced to a level plain be-
fore construction is begun.
What can planners do to save the
city? Mixed high- and low-rise housing
is only part of the answer. Planners must
realize that the city needs a core and
that this core must be the most densely-
populated area in the city. Existing facil-
ities that retain the historic, cultural, and
social characteristics of the city must not
be replaced by parks that resemble ceme-
teries. Pedestrian, not automobile, scale is
necessary. The core must be a place for
walking, not driving. If necessary, the
area may be turned into a pedestrian mall.
Chain stores must not be entirely substi-
tuted for independently-owned ones.
More light and space is needed, but not
at the expense of building monotonous
glass and steel cages.
Transportation facilities are becom-
ing outmoded faster than cities are re-
placing them. The number of cars that
is predicted to be in use by 1975 is stag-
gering. The downtown area will never
become any sort of magnet for people
if the highway system leading to the
city's center is inadequate. Any plans for
renewal or development in the downtown
area must include a solution to the city's
snarled traffic system.
Sir Christopher Wren's plan for Lon-
don in the seventeenth century is still
applicable; planners must create civic
centers that will be "multiple, manage-
able, centers of civic life." Middle-income
housing should be subsidized. The dirt
and decay of slums must be replaced but
the individuality and the spontaniety of
these areas should by some means be re-
tained. Landscape architects, not engin-
eers, should be encouraged to do subdi-
vision design. If necessary, acreage zon-
ing might be resorted to in order to
preserve "greenbelts" or areas of natural
countryside, on the outskirts of the
heavily-urbanized area.
These goals can never be accomplished
by planners alone, no matter how skilled.
The public must take an interest in civic
design if cities are to be reshaped ac-
cording to human needs. Only through
an understanding of its fundamental
advantages can we find hope for the
strong and secure future of the Ameri-
can city, and an increase in the delights
and benefits of urban life. "Designing a
dream city is easy," as one planner has
pointed out, "rebuilding a living one
takes imagination."

That deteriorating transportation facil-
ities within the city constitute one of
the most important problems in the
changing metropolitan scene is perhaps
well known to every citizen who has ever
been caught in rush-hour traffic. Yet the
manner in which our major American
cities may extricate themselves from this
rapidly worsening situation is a topic of
heated controversy among urban planners
and city officials.
In most of the larger cities in the
United States, the streetcar has almost
disappeared whereas subways, buses and
commuter trains are proving to be far
from adequate. Expressways are pouring
traffic into the downtown area while no
means of handling these cars, once they
arrive downtown, is yet apparent. Many-
early city planners assumed that the num-
ber of automobiles would increase very
slowly with time and that most people
would continue to travel by public transit.
The opposite has proved to be true. A
recent survey by Fortune Magazine found
that auto registrations have increased
from 25,800,000 in 1945 to 54,300,000
in 1956. "Transit riding on the other
hand, has continued to decline: streetcar
passengers down 78%; bus riders down
28%; subway-elevated down 17%. To-
day the average American uses public
transit less than half as much as he did
in the late Twenties."
Perhaps the most pressing question is
whether the city will continue to serve
as a unifying core for its surrounding
metropolitan region, or whether it will be
completely fragmented. If urban trans-
portation costs—not only in money but in
time and annoyance—rise any more, they
will cancel all the advantages of the city.
The vital central core of the city may be
replaced by an ugly business and cultural
center, surrounded by endless sprawl—
Los Angeles being an excellent example
of this type of inefficient arrangement.
Just how to relieve this congestion and
preserve the core of the city becomes
the central problem.
First we must realize that the auto-
mobile at present is the fastest way of
getting out of the downtown area (with
the exception of rail commuters). The
motorist's average speed is 20 mph com-
pared with 13 mph for the busiest transit
routes. Just how long this will continue
is the important question. Fortune reports
that the forecast is for over two new
vehicles on the road for every three ad-
ditional Americans, "by 1957 the U.S.
will have over 100 million vehicles for
a population of 220 million. Nearly half

KALAMAZOO SAYS "NO"
The Technic's roving reporter discovers that the
cornerstone for the city of tomorrow has been
laid a scant hundred miles west of Ann Arbor.
By BRYAN WHIPPLE
Associate Editor
"... Ann Arbor, Jackson, Battle
Creek, Kalamazoo, Niles . . . . " These
cities of Southern Michigan sprawl along
the tracks of the Michigan Central Rail-
road with monotony seldom relieved by
sights such as a fair university campus,
or an ugly prison. Yet one of these cities,
Kalamazoo, boasts something so unique
and intriguing that we decided to investi-
gate it personally. Kalamazoo has begun
to build the city of tomorrow—not in
the sticks, nor in the suburbs, but right
in the heart of downtown.
It all started back in 1956, when the
merchants of downtown Kalamazoo be-
gan to get edgy about business trends.
In their city of 75,000, one year (1955)
had seen a million-dollar drop in the
assessed valuation of the CBD (central
business district). Retail sales were be-
ginning to fall off, and the exodus of
retail business to outlying areas was mak-
ing empty stores an all-too-frequent
sight.
To make matters worse, downtown
streets were choked with traffic. Predic-
tions for future traffic, based on the
fast growth of the metropolitan area,
made a grim picture indeed. Widening
of streets, prohibition of certain turns
and of on-street parking, one-way streets,
and the other usual means of increasing
street capacity were cither impractical or
in use. City fathers were at their wits'
end.
Merchants usually feel the bite of ad-
vancing blight more rapidly than the
tax-supported instruments of government.
In Kalamazoo they responded to the
needs of their community with a vigor
and optimism seldom equalled by such
groups. Late in 1956 they incorporated
themselves as the Downtown Planning
Committee, Inc., and several leading con-
sulting firms were invited in to discuss
means by which the Kalamazoo CBD
might be revitalized.
By spring of 1957 the DPC had

$40,000 in subscriptions from its mem-
bers and retained Victor Gruen Associates
as a consulting firm, partly on the basis
of a downtown plan executed by that
firm for Fort Worth, Texas.
In March, 1958, the long-range plan,
which depicted an auto-free central busi-
ness district, was presented to the public.
The plan and report was entitled "Kala-
mazoo 1980" after its ultimate target
date, but this by no means implied that
its contents were only some beautiful
theory pertaining to the misty future.
The plan called for construction of the
new Kalamazoo in stages, with a maxi-
mum of flexibility consistent with ade-
quate planning and control. It is in this
respect that "Kalamazoo 1980" is an
unusual city plan; it is workable. Even
more important, the first stage of this total
downtown facelift is nearly complete.
Pedestrian Mall
Burdick Street is (or was) a heavily-
trafficked, although narrow, north-south
artery bisecting the downtown area. On
June 1, 1959, workmen from the city's
Parks Department removed all of the
fourteen inches of blacktop, brick, and
concrete that had served the busiest down-
town block of Burdick Street as a pave-
ment.
Following many months of careful
study by the city planning staff and other
municipal departments, a recommenda-
tion had been adopted to tie off this
artery permanently for two blocks, be-
tween Water and South Streets, and con-
vert it into an attractive pedestrian mall,
thus restoring to the citizenry the right
to stroll about and shop at ease in the
heart of a city for the first time since the
disappearance of the Greek agora, the
Roman forum, or perhaps the Algerian
market-place.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the legality of closing a street to vehicu-
lar traffic. Kalamazoo found several legal
justifications for its action: the City
Charter specifically grants the power to
"use, control, and regulate the use of its
streets, alleys, bridges, public places, and
the space above and beneath them." It
also grants to the City Commission the
authority "to exercise all of the powers
conferred on the City." These charter
provisions are implementations of like
express powers set out in the State's Home
Rule Act. It also was pointed out that the
pedestrian mall does not propose to
vacate or abandon the public rights in a
street, but merely to limit the use made
of the area.
"Who should pay for the mall?" Since
the merchants were eager for the imple-
mentation of the Gruen Plan, they agreed
to share the cost with the city, and were
duly assessed for half the estimated ex-
penditure, or $30,000. The city trans-
ferred the other half of the required
funds from accounts for other improve-
ment projects that had run under their
budget amounts.
In addition the city sold bonds worth
$625,000 to finance 250 additional off-
street parking spaces, all within two
blocks of the mall.
The actual construction of the mall
progressed rapidly. Two blocks have been
completed to date. The north block of
Burdick Street is 264 feet long and the
south block is 660 feet long. The street
proper was 40 feet wide and the total
right-of-way 66 feet wide. The shorter
block was converted first, to see whether
any bugs would develop; it was also
better from a traffic point of view. The

cross-street between the blocks has been
left open, as can be seen in the photos.
Features added to the north block to
enhance its appearance included flowers
and other plantings, which are changed
seasonally to remain attractive, and a re-
flecting pool. The street area is a check-
erboard pattern of multicolored concrete
tiles, surrounded by lawns and gardens.
Low evergreens and shrubs are now
growing.
In the longer block there is a small
children's playground which has proved
an immense success. There is also an
outdoor stage, designed to revolve with
special displays and exhibits. Pools with
fountains and colored lights, modern
benches, and gardens similar to those of

of the long block.
Snow removal and possible fire truck
passage have been planned for. The
necessary equipment is able to pick its
way across the flagstones to reach all areas
of the mall. Delivery of goods to the
retail stores was somewhat of a problem
in the north block, which is inadequately
served by rear alleyways. Presently goods
are being brought in by hand truck in
the early morning from the cross-streets.
Since the heaviest merchandise to be
moved in is cases of beer to a beer store,
the problem is not too severe, although it
may be critical in planning future exten-
sions of the mall.
Project Successful
This naturally leads us to ask, what
does Kalamazoo think of its mall, now
that it's irrevocably in place? Are the
merchants stuck with a lemon, or are the
off-mall stores eager to get on it? Well,
they certainly are eager, and the mall will
in all likelihood march south again this
summer, and possibly even start on an
adjacent street!
Mr. William A. Ripatte, Planning Di-
rector for the city of Kalamazoo and au-
thority on downtown malls, writes us as
follows on the subject of the practica-
bility of pedestrian streets, and adds some
particulars about the one that Kalamazoo
is pushing forward into 1980 . . .
1) "A pedestrian shopping mall in any
downtown is no cure-all for down-
town problems—it does not get at
problems of traffic congestion, park-
ing, obsolescent buildings, etc.

BLESSING
BLIGHT?


suburbs will soon become a blight on the American landscape,
unless drastic action is taken.
Map reproduced by permission of the American Automobile Association.
by BARRY L. PEEBLES
Editor-in-Chief
Suburbia represents a dreary blight
on the American landscape, the epitome
of American standardization and vulgar-
ization, with its row upon monotonous
row of mass-produced cheerfulness, mas-
querading as home.
—American (Oct. 17, 1959)
"Dreary blight" and "epitome of vul-
garization"—these are strong words to
direct at modern man's beloved suburbs.
Are we to accept them at face value? Do
they prophesy the beginning of the end
of suburbia as we know it today? Is sub-
urbia a blessing .... or a blight?
Today the suburbs are mainly a bless-
ing— but they won't be tomorrow un-
less drastic action is taken. The reason:
in only forty years over 85% of our
population will live in urbania, megalo-
polis, subtopia, or whatever you want
to call our huge metropolitan areas. At
the same time nearly 35% of our popu-
lation will be jammed into only ten giant
supercities. Just to bring facts closer to
home, can you imagine the Detroit area's
3.4 million residents expanded to 9.5
million? Well, that's what the Urban
Land Institute says will happen by the
year 2000. But this is not just a long-
range problem—Newsweek reports that
today's 100 million metropolitan popu-
lation will jump 40 million in just ten
short years.
If these facts are true, and there seems
no reason to doubt them, the big ques-
tion is: "Can we handle this urban ex-
plosion without ending up with a massive
urban slum?" The answer is yes, if we
start now with intelligent planning and
control. "Now" is the important word
because already the "wolf is at the door"
—blight has set in and is beginning to
spread. For this reason let us examine
the situation today for both a glimpse
at things to come and clues to a solu-
tion.
First of all, there can be no doubt that
there exists a mass exodus to suburbs—
large enough to consume 3000 acres a
day in new home sites, according to the
editors of Fortune. With each passing
month the pressure from city dwellers
for new homes in the suburbs builds up.
Naturally the developers respond by
moving their bulldozers onto more and
more untouched land.
At first, it might be assumed that the
problem is a shortage of land near the
metropolitan areas. Examination reveals
this to be the result, but the underlying
cause is in the way land is used. Five or
ten acres are used where one would work,
and worse results are obtained. Accord-
ing to William H. Whyte, Jr., author of
the 1957 best seller. The Organization
Man, the big lot and helter-skelter de-
velopments, while at first attractive, are
the real troublemakers. In his words "...
a few casually placed developments rob
the community of scores of choices that
would be important to it five or ten
years from now—for parks, industrial
districts, reservoirs, .md just plain breath-
ing space." Whyte, assistant managing
editor of Fortune, recently proposed "a
plan to save the vanishing U. S. coun-
tryside" while still providing enjoyable
suburban living. We will return to
his plan later, but first several other
critical areas of concern to suburbia and
its residents need mention.
Not the least of these other problems
is who pays—the newcomers or the older
residents? With each new development,
someone must accept the financial burden
for schools, water and sewage, as well
as police and fire protection. Generally,
the greatest burden has fallen, not on
the newcomers, but on the residents of
nearby existing communities. This prob-
lem is especially acute with respect to
schools. For instance, Business Week re-
ports that if 100 acres were developed
in a typical community at four houses
per acre, there would be $175,000 of
additional school costs with an increase
in tax return of $80,000. Because of the
equal taxation principle, both old and
new residents would share the difference
in costs—a fact that displeases the old
residents considerably.
To make matters worse, the political
system and government organization in
these areas is generally inadequate. The
cause of this problem can be traced to
the lack of area-wide authority and re-
sponsibility. According to a report made
at an annual Governors' Conference, in
metropolitan areas where several local
governments operate, "metropolitan needs
have outmoded substantial parts of the
local government system." However,
metro super-governments may not be the
complete answer to this problem either,
unless they are given the power they
need. This is brought out in the Gov-
ernors' report when it states that, even
in areas where the local government en-
compasses most of the metropolitan area,
its powers are inadequate.
To sum up the situation, it can be said
that an ever-increasing tide is rolling out
from the cities, while the people from
the existing suburbs, under financial and
political pressure, are trying to hold back
the tide—but to no avail. Before going
into the plans suggested by the experts
to keep megalopolis from becoming
"mess-opolis," let us see just wnat has
been done or attempted in the past, both
by the builders and by the communities
themselves.
In general, the outlying areas have
done little planning or study in the past,
and there is little likelihood of this
attitude changing. That is, little plan-
ning until after one or two hit-and-run
developers have slapped up hundreds of
look-alike houses. Then the town fathers
go into action with zoning laws and
other restrictive procedures, most of
which are useless at this late date.
The most common way of "closing
the gate after the horse is out" is to start
"upzoning" the land—decreasing the
number of houses that can be built per
acre. For instance, if the minimum size
lot is upped from 7,500 square feet to

The solution to the slum problem lies in low-cost
housing and urban redevelopment.

Lurking in the shadows of every
middle-aged, run-down neighbor-
hood is that cesspool of wretched human-
ity called a slum.
"A slum is most simply defined as
housing (on whatever scale) so inade-
quate or so deteriorated as to endanger
the health, safety or morals of its inhabi-
tants. A blighted residential area is one
on the downgrade, which has not reached
the slum stage." (Edith Elmer Wood)
"A blighted area is defined as one that
has become an economic liability to the
community, that is, one on which the
taxes do not pay for public service."
(Architects Club of Chicago)
While the full-blown slum is a social
problem, blight, the progenitor of slums,
is largely an economic one. The heart
of the matter appears to be the discrep-
ancy between the value an owner places
on his property and the amount that
can be paid for appropriate develop-
ment. When land prices fall, the owner
holds on to his property in the hope
that he can still sell for a good price. He
becomes increasingly unwilling to im-
prove or even to repair the buildings
which he may own, and less able to
afford it as he waits for the value of his
holdings to go up. So the buildings rot
while the poorest classes live in them.
Ironically, such a situation can some-
times be quite profitable to the owner
who manages to crowd five or six families
into space intended for only one. This
can happen in cities where housing laws
are weak or are poorly enforced. It is

ical center.
just as bad for a landlord to rent sub-
standard housing as it is for a butcher to
sell wormy meat.
A second basic cause of blight is the
fact that business has not expanded into
the spaces left by people who moved out
of the central region of the city, as it
was expected to do. Reasons why it has
not include the following: the skyscraper
lets business grow upward ■ rather than
outward; technological improvement in
methods of manufacturing causes indus-
try to require less space; an increasing
tendency is for companies to locate on the
outskirts of the city; and finally, numer-
ous shopping centers have been built
in the suburbs to relieve the parking
difficulty in the center of town.

living in those areas, proud, dedicated
homeowners, careful of property values.
But the prosperous move on to more de-
sirable housing as a matter of course, and
the others moved because something
happened to lower property values.
How Blight Starts
One of the things that can start
blight is a change in land use within a
neighborhood. If a family converts its
house to a grocery store, or builds a mul-
tiple-family structure on a single-family
lot, while the value to the owner him-
self may increase, the desirability, and
hence the value of the neighborhood, is
lessened to other residents, encouraging
them to move elsewhere.
Another cause is change of occupancy;
that is, if a family that moves sells to a
family of lower "standards" or of less
means, the latter's unwillingness or in-
ability to keep up or improve the proper-
ty becomes a blight promoter. Other fac-
tors are racial discrimination, unfavor-
able geography and city planning, and
unwise zoning.
Sometimes a residential area is un-
wittingly laid out in a potentially smoggy
or swampy region. When those who can
do so move out, poorer people move in
because they cannot afford to live any-
where else. Poverty is not always syn-
onymous with blight and slums, but it
is an aggravating factor. The cost to the
city of police and fire protection and
public health goes up as blight progress-
es, even as the residents become less
able to pay the city taxes. It actually
costs a city more to keep a slum than
to clear it.
The automobile and rapid transit de-
serve some blame for the situation
because they make it easier for people
to live in the suburbs and work in the
city. Expressways do not increase the
value of bordering property because ex-
pressway users are not potential customers
to someone who owns or builds a store
along one.
Of course, if enough suitable housing
close to jobs was provided which the
poorer classes could afford, they wouldn't
have to occupy substandard housing. But
private investors could not break even
on such an undertaking, so the people
who are least able to change their lot

are put into the worst circumstances.
These, then, are the major causes of
slums and blight. To prevent this shame-
ful scarring of our cities would entail
consideration of every facet and mobiliz-
ing for positive action, even before the
city plan is drawn up. Slum prevention
is an extremely complex problem involv-
ing intangible human factors; indeed,
some have declared slums unavoidable.
Presently the major emphasis is not on
prevention, but cure.
Enter F.D.R.
American awakening to the fact that
substandard housing is a serious problem
dates largely from 1933, the year in
which Franklin D. Roosevelt first took
office. Because Roosevelt was an advo-
cate of slum clearance and low-cost hous-
ing, he included funds for such projects
in the budget of his Federal Adminis-
tration of Public Works.
The first project of this kind in the
country was Techwood Homes in Atlanta,
Georgia, dedicated in November, 1935.
Since then, public housing and urban
renewal programs have been set up in
cities across the country. These are con-
tinuous programs, for blight became so
well established that much work has to
be done in extermination, even as un-
affected sections of the city must be
guarded against the danger.
A city's Local Public Agency is the
community agency designated to work
closely with the federal government's
Urban Renewal Administration on its
plans for city improvement. This is its
foremost function. In Detroit, the L.P.A.
is the Detroit Housing Commission, es-
tablished in 1934. Its first public housing
projects were Parkside Homes and Brew-
ster Homes, both now over twenty years
old, the latter bc-ing built on land cleared
of slums.
Since then, several public housing
projects have been completed in Detroit:
Frederick Douglass Homes, the most re-
cent, finished in 1955; Charles Terrace
on the East Side; Herman Gardens and
John W. Smith Homes in the northwest
section; Sojourner Truth Homes, the
smallest development with 200 apart-
ments, and Edward J. Jeffries Homes
with 2,170 apartments, the largest one
to date.
Public housing differs from urban re-
newal in that it is financed by a federal
loan which is paid back by the city. It
provides housing for those who cannot
pay for private housing. In Detroit, at
least, rent is based on individual income
and it ranges from 28 to 88 dollars,
including all utilities. The maximum
monthly rental is S70 for a one-bedroom
unit, $76 for a two-bedroom unit, $82
for a three-bedroom unit and $88 for a
four-bedroom unit.
Eligibility to live in public housing is
based on income, too. To be admitted,
the net annual income after exemptions
of a family of one or two must not ex-
ceed $4,200, $4,300 for three or four,
and $4,700 for five or more. For con-
tinued occupancy, a family's income may
rise several hundred dollars before it is
asked to leave. Specifically, the limit for
continued occupancy for one or two is
$4,700, for three or four, $5,000, and
for five or more, $5,500. Families may
add $100 for each child in the last
category.
These figures became effective last Ek-
cember when the old limits were raised
to represent more accurately the lower
economic class incomes. The incomes of

all residents must be checked at least
once yearly, and if residents exceed the
maximum continued-occupancy income,
they are given notice of six months in
which to find another place to live. The
family doesn't have to move if, before
the six months are up, its income drops
back to within the limit. Other reasons
for eviction are nonpayment of rent and
lease violations. Residents must maintain
high standards of cleanliness, which they
are generally glad to do.
To help fill the needs of two groups
which often can't afford decent quarters
in private housing, the Detroit Housing
Commission plans to set aside one four-
teen-story building at Jeffries Homes
solely for elderly couples and another for
families of students attending Wayne
State University and the other colleges
and universities in the vicinity. These
families will meet the regular admission
requirements.
Urban renewal is the result of the
Housing Act of 1949, through which the
government provides funds for the re-
development of certain areas which are
designated by the city as blighted. That
is, the city buys up parcels of blighted
property—in Detroit, the amounts range
from 35 to 150 acres. Then it puts in
sewers and utilities and resells it to pri-
vate redevelopers at a marked-down
price. The federal government pays two
thirds of the difference between the sell-
ing price and the cost of acquiring and
improving the land, while the city pays
the remaining third. The developers must
follow the city's scheme for the property
and build whatever the project plans call
for, such as parks, private housing, stores,
office buildings, industrial plants and the
like. In this way, the property can be
improved and the investors can make
money, at relatively small cost to the city.
A different phase of urban renewal is
neighborhood conservation which stems
from the Housing Act of 1954. This act
finances the removal of substandard
homes from blighted areas and the im-
provement of the standard homes. This
procedure stops blight before it becomes
a social and economic problem.
Those persons who are displaced be-
cause of highways, redevelopment and
other public improvement become the
responsibility of the Housing Commis-
sion; it is required to find "decent, safe
and sanitary" housing for all such peo-
ple. Roughly one-third of them go into
public housing.
One of the more interesting projects
Detroit is currently engaged in is the
Mack-Concord Conservation Project, the
first of its kind in the country. Some of
the land has already been cleared for a
four-acre park and a condemnation case
has been filed for 32 lots opposite an
industrial belt, which will be redevel-
oped as a parking facility by the indus-
tries themselves. Fifty-one other middle-
aged neighborhoods will benefit from
the experience gained through Mack-
Concord.
Another is the Central Business Dis-
trict Project No. 1, which is designed to
clean out Skid Row, replace it by light
industry suitable to the location and re-
locate the 1,400 single persons, mostly
men, living there. A third is the Medical
Center, an area including Grace, Harper,
Women's and Children's Hospitals. To
these will be added more hospital and
related medical buildings and housing
for medical personnel. This program was
begun in 1957 and will extend over a
ten-year period.
The Local Public Agency's first func-
tion is to collaborate with the federal
government; the second is to enlist the
support of the various city departments
"in an effort to replace the City's hope-
lessly blighted sections with new devel-
opment, to preserve what is worth pre-
serving, to provide for improvements in
an orderly fashion."

AND
RESEARCH
by CHARLES MASSER
The average student does not realize
how much basic research is carried on at
U-M. Almost every day the Technic
receives information on research projects
that are being studied by U-M faculty
members. In this issue will be found such
topics as the appointment of Professor
Henry J. Gomberg as the head of the
Phoenix project, development and use of
scientific principles for the design of
better protective helmets, and the arrival
of a three pole magnet that has started
research on how magnetism affects mag-
netic materials.
New Helmet Design
Has Better Protection
Racing drivers and football players,
and the drive-to-work motorist too, soon
may risk their skulls and brains less in
these activities. A medical faculty mem-
ber and an engineer at The University of
Michigan have devised scientific princi-
ples for the design of better protective
helmets. Prof. Wilfred T. Dempster
(Sc.D.) of the Department of Anatomy
and Prof. Samuel K. Clark (Ph.D.) of
the Department of Engineering Mechan-
ics recently completed a report on the
subject for a headgear manufacturer. They
believe there are certain underlying prin-
ciples that can be developed for the de-
sign of many such protective accessories,
and suspect that participants in other
risk activities such as motorcycling, fire
fighting, boxing, skiing and hockey could
benefit too.
In their search for scientific guides for
helmet design, Professor Dempster ex-
amined the human skull's strong and
weak points, and Professor Clark tackled
energy absorption and distribution prob-
lems. Skull fractures and closed head
injuries (such as concussion) were main
considerations for protection, but they
pointed out that the face should be pro-
tected too. The upper and lower jaws
are particularly vulnerable parts of the
head. As yet, a suitable face protection,
which doesn't restrict vision hasn't been
developed. They recommend each helmet
have a hard, impenetrable outer shell, an
impact-energy absorbing liner, and web-
bing to distribute the force of blows to
the strong points of the skull. Dempster
says the skulls strongest points are the
forehead on either side and the very
back.
Best for the helmet's outershell seems
to be a glass-reinforced plastic, while the
best liner material may be a slow rebound
plastic similar in consistency to a dry
kitchen sponge. "We are looking for a
liner with the best acceleration reducing
characteristics," Clark explained, "as well
as the best energy absorbing character-
istics." Increasing the time it takes—
even by as little as a small fraction of a
second—for an object striking the head
to impart its energy of motion to the
skull (thus "accelerating" the skull)
would considerably reduce the force of
impact reaching the brain and skull. A
slow rebound type of plastic would
"crush" under impact relatively slowly
and thus would reduce acceleration more
than a "springier" material. "These en-
ergy absorbing liners, unless designed
properly, can flaw an otherwise protec-
tive helmet. In the past, too little atten-
tion has been paid to the acceleration
reducing characteristics of liners."
Their recommendations may encourage
wider application of scientific principles
to the design of other types of protec-
tive clothing.
"The technique involved in this oper-
ation is applicable to any such situation—
within limits," Dempster says. "The work
is representative of what can be done in
other areas of protection."

Dick Ernsdorff studies a microwave site-layout chart atop a moun-
tain near Orting, in western Washington state. On assignments like
this, he often carries $25,000 worth of equipment with him.
Here, Dick checks line-of-sight with a distant repeater station by
mirror-flashing and confirms reception by portable radio. Using this
technique, reflections of the sun's rays can be seen as far as 50 miles.
He wears two kinds of work togs
For engineer Richard A. Ernsdorff, the "uniform of the
day" changes frequently. A Monday might find him in a
checkered wool shirt on a Washington or Idaho mountain
top. Wednesday could be a collar-and-tie day.
Dick is a transmission engineer with the Pacific Tele-
phone and Telegraph Company in Seattle, Washington. He
joined the company in June, 1956. after getting his B.S.E.E.
degree from Washington State University. '"I wanted to
work in Washington," he says, "with an established, grow-
ing company where I could find a variety of engineering op-
portunities and could use some imagination in my work."
Dick spent iy» years in rotational, on-the-job training,
doing power and equipment engineering and "learning the
business." Since April, 1959, he has worked with micro-
wave radio relay systems in the Washington-Idaho area.
When Dick breaks out his checkered shirt, he's headed
for the mountains. He makes field studies involving micro-
wave systems and SAGE radars and trouble-shoots any
problem that arises. He also engineers "radar remoting"
facilities which provide a vital communications link be-
tween radar sites and Air Force Operations.
A current assignment is a new 11,000 mc radio route
from central Washington into Canada, utilizing reflectors
on mountains and repeaters (amplifiers) in valleys. It's a
million-dollar-plus project.
"I don't know where an engineer could find more inter-
esting work," says Dick.

The field has never been broader
The challenge has never been greater
Engineers at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft today are concerned
with the development of all forms of flight propulsion
systems—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and other advanced
types for propulsion in space. Many of these systems are so
entirely new in concept that their design and development,
and allied research programs, require technical personnel
not previously associated with the development of aircraft
engines. Where the company was once primarily interested
in graduates with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical
engineering, it now also requires men with degrees in
electrical, chemical, and nuclear engineering, and in physics,
chemistry, and metallurgy.
Included in a wide range of engineering activities open to
technically trained graduates at all levels are these four
basic fields:
ANALYTICAL ENGINEERING Men engaged in this
activity are concerned with fundamental investigations in
the fields of science or engineering related to the conception
of new products. They carry out detailed analyses of ad-
vanced flight and space systems and interpret results in
terms of practical design applications. They provide basic
information which is essential in determining the types of
systems that have development potential.
DESIGN ENGINEERING The prime requisite here is an
active interest in the application of aerodynamics, thermo-
dynamics, stress analysis, and principles of machine design
to the creation of new flight propulsion systems. Men en-
gaged in this activity at P&amp;WA establish the specific per-
formance and structural requirements of the new product
and design it as a complete working mechanism.
EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING Here men supervise
and coordinate fabrication, assembly and laboratory testing
of experimental apparatus, system components, and devel-
opment engines. They devise test rigs and laboratory setups,
specify instrumentation and direct execution of the actual
test programs. Responsibility in this phase of the develop-
ment program also includes analysis of test data, reporting
of results and recommendations for future effort.
MATERIALS ENGINEERING Men active in this field
at P&amp;WA investigate metals, alloys and other materials
under various environmental conditions to determine their
usefulness as applied to advanced flight propulsion systems.
They devise material testing methods and design special
test equipment. They are also responsible for the determina-
tion of new fabrication techniques and causes of failures or
manufacturing difficulties.

COMPLEX VARIABLES AND APPLICATIONS
New Second Edition
By RUEL V. CHURCHILL, University of Michigan
A thorough revision of a fine textbook for juniors, seniors, and graduate students in mathematics and
engineering who have completed one semester of advanced calculus. The book deals with the theory
of functions of a complex variable and its applications. The theory is noted for its elegance in logical
structure and powerful results.
The first aim of the book is to give a sound and straightforward presentation of theory through the
differential and integral calculus of analytic functions, residues, and conformal transformations and the con-
nections between analytic and harmonic functions. The second aim is to give a full introduction to some
of the important applications in applied mathematics, engineering, and physics, and to link these applica-
tions carefully to the theory.

New Three-Pole Magnet
Magnets with three poles are almost as
scarce as men on the moon. But not
quite. The University of Michigan has
one, believed to be unique. One of a
pair of magnets on campus is being used
for research for the armed services. It's
designed for basic research on how mag-
netism affects magnetic materials which
in turn affect microwaves (ultra-short
radio waves). The research is part of a
project undertaken by Associate Prof.
Dale M. Grimes (Ph.D.), of the Elec-
trical Engineering Department, under the
direction of the U-M Research Institute
(UMRI).
The three-pole magnet is being applied
particularly to lining up crystals of mag-
netic materials used as microwave cir-
cuit elements. (These are ceramic ma-
terials like those used in telephone equip-
ment, and in radio and television sets).
The crystals are really tiny magnets, but
the magnetic north-south axis of each is
not parallel to its crystalline axis. If the
crystals were compass needles, for ex-
ample, the crystalline axis would not line
EDUCATION AND RESEARCH

itself up north and south, but instead
would point somewhere between east and
west (in a vertical plane). The crystal-
line axis cannot therefore be lined up in
a normal magnetic field. The tri-polar
magnet gets around this "discrepancy" by
aligning the crystals in a single direc-
tion—straight up. It can do this because,
besides having an odd number of poles,
it rotates the poles at 120 cycles per sec-
ond. Thus, in effect, forces of both poles
are created all around the crystals so
there is only one direction of least resist-
ance for them to point in. That direction
is up. The three-pole magnet is about
the size of a ten-pound wheel of cheese,
about a foot and a half in diameter. It
was custom built in California for about
$800.
The second magnet, supplied with
funds from the Air Force and UMRI.
is not uncommon. It is much larger, and
looks like two solid black discs about
four feet in diameter which face each
other a foot or so apart. The poles are
twin silver-colored discs centered in the
larger discs. The purpose of this magnet,
Professor Grimes explains, is to form a
strong yet highly accurate and control-
lable magnetic field, also for research on
micro-waves and magnetic materials.
This magnet, he says, is equipped with a
voltage regulator that will hold the mag-
netic force accurate to one part to 10
million over a 10 per cent change in in-
put voltage. Its maximum power is about
18,000 gauss. (This means that the pull-
ing force between the pole faces is equal
to about four tons).
Three main uses for this magnet, ac-
cording to Professor Grimes, are:
1. To determine how microwaves be-
have in certain magnetic materials;
2. To measure the strength of pole-
seeking properties of oxygen-containing
magnetic ceramics at temperatures near
absolute zero; and,
3. To measure magnetic anisotropy—
or how much force it takes to turn the
polar axis within the crystals.
Professor Grimes expects to have these:
experiments well underway within six
months.

Brazil will realize a 152-year-old
dream early this spring when her new
inland capital city is dedicated. Brasilia
is unique among cities in that it will be-
come the only major city to have been
built entirely according to a single mag-
nificent plan. Ultramodern in every re-
spect, Brasilia will be home to a half
million citizens as well as the govern-
ment of the largest South American re-
public.

Designed by Brazilian architect Lucio
Costa, the initial plan for major arteries
and centers within the city consists of
two intersecting axes, one straight and
one curved, giving the appearance of a
giant bird in flight. At the head of the
bird is a triangular plaza at whose corners
lie the buildings housing the three
branches of government. Beyond these
buildings will rise other governmental
and commercial buildings. The curved
axis is to become a residential area. An
artificial lake has been created surround-
ing the new city on three sides.
Only a glimpse of these pictures
will convince one that this is to be one
of the truly outstanding cities of the
world. Both beautiful and functional,
Brasilia should serve as an inspiration
to men of all lands, for here is proof
that overgrowth and decay need not
doom the city. Here is a manifest exam-
ple of the exalted beauty in which man
may live, and through which he might
at last discover peace and dignity for his
own life and for his race.

of all motor-vehicle mileage is accumu-
lated on the 373,000 miles of streets
that are within city limits. All the vehic-
les registered since 1945 would stretch
more than 125,000 miles bumper to
bumper. In this same period the amount
of city-street mileage has increased by
only about 60,000."
Some recent events and pronounce-
ments by railroad officials and transpor-
tation experts have brought city officials
the specter of a day when commuter
trains might be forced to stop running.
The chaos of present traffic jams would
then pale by comparison.
To alleviate the situation somewhat,
the greatest public-works program in
modern history has begun. Under the
new Federal-Aid Highway Act, a 41,000
mile superhighway network that will
crisscross the U.S. will be built. The na-
tion will spend $100 billion on roads
in the next 10 years. About half of the
Federal-Aid Act money will be used to
build some 5,500 miles of high-capacity
urban expressway. Some officials feel that
new expressways will relieve downtown
congestion. It is difficult to believe, how-
ever, that enabling more cars to enter
the downtown area will relieve down-
town congestion.
Obviously, the measures so far taken
are mere stop-gaps. Some experts esti-
mate that some form of rapid transit is
needed by all metropolitan areas over
750,000 population, which means that
some 20 U.S. communities are, or should,
be in the market for modernized rapid
transit.
The most persistently proposed new
transit system, and thus far the most
radical, is monorail. One of the most
ambitious proposals put forth recently
came from Detroit's Rapid Transit Com-
mission. They recommended a 54-mile,
$250 million monorail system, with a
later 240-mile extension into the sub-
urbs. According to Architectural Forum
(January 1959), the reason is simple:
"monorail is lighter, faster; less obstruc-
tive of right of way, light, and air, and
cheaper (cost $4 to $5 million per mile),
than subways ($12 to $15 million per
mile), rails on expressway malls ($8
to $9 million per mile), or modern ele-
vated ($6 million per mile). With top
speeds of 80 mph and average trip speeds
of 30 to 40 mph, monorail would be 3
to 4 times faster, than Detroit's present
(Continued from page 19)
bus service, and up to twice as fast as
private automobiles. One rapid transit
track can move up to 40,000 people past
a given point in an hour, the equivalent
of 16 lanes of modern expressway."
Meanwhile developments in more con-
ventional commuter systems have not
been lacking though they are only slight-
ly more successful in sales than monorail.
Even subways are being planned. Archi-
tectural Forum (January, 1959), claims
that the program is going to be of
longer range than many planners realize:
". . . if rapid transit is to be
financially feasible and serve the
future, the cities are faced with
the problem of building new transit
systems, specialized for really rapid
service, from the ground up, a situ-
ation hardly met within a half a
century."
Yet these are far from being solutions
to the crisis. Recently many job oppor-
tunities have been occurring at the fringes
of the metropolitan area and in the sub-
urbs. Mass transit would seem to be an
in adquate solution for the present home-
to-work pattern of traffic. The commuter
railroad was perfect for traffic between
low-density housing and high-density
working areas. The subway has been
adequate for high-density to high-density
movements within the city. However,
efficient mass transit for low-density to
low-density movement is impossible.
Imaginative Redevelopment
This brings us back to the automobile
as the cheapest and most rational way to
circulate people in and around tomor-
row's low-density metropolis. But our
cities need not become as fragmented as
Los Angeles; the core can be preserved
by intelligent, imaginative redevelop-
ment.
One fact must be faced. No matter
how numerous the expressways, parking
space must be provided for cars entering
the metropolitan area. Statistics point
toward more cars arriving in areas where
parking is insufficient even at the present
time. This might prompt some thought
about pedestrian malls to replace certain
congested areas as in the Gruen plan for
Fort Worth. Few realize that Gruen's
proposal is based on the assumption that
half of the people traveling to the center
of town will travel by rapid public tran-
sit. Thus we are still in need of a re-
vival of mass transit.
Similarly, the proposed building of
double-level streets and parking garages
will only add to the congrestion. What
is needed is to convince people not to
bring their cars. The answer to this, of
course, is mass transit.
Thus a realistic approach to the prob-
lem of future transportation needs must
be one in which rapid transport is seen
as inevitable. The car will no doubt be
used more and more, but an effort must
be made to avoid monstrous "auto-cities",
grotesque nightmares which have no
human scale. If this major problem is
to be solved a new and dynamic balance
must be struck between rapid transit,
automobile and pedestrian traffic.

RCA SERVES

ELECTRONICS

One of the sharpest photos ever taken of
sun's surface. It, and hundreds of others
taken by stratoscope, may answer mystery
of violent magnetic disturbances on earth.
Exact position of photograph in relation
to the total sun surface is shown here. Plotting
and photography of precise areas was made
possible by airborne RCA television.
RCA REPORTS TO THE NATION:
Going up for "good seeing." Un-
manned balloon-observatory starts its
ascent to take sunspot photos. "Project
Stratoscope" is a continuing program
of the Office of Naval Research and
the National Science Foundation.
REMARKABLE NEW PHOTOS UNLOCK
MYSTERIES OF SUN'S SURFACE
Special RCA Television, operating from stratosphere,
helps get sharpest photos of sun's surface ever taken
Scientists recently took the first,
sharp, searching look into the center of
our solar system. It was achieved not
by a missile, but by a balloon posted
in quiet reaches of the stratosphere.
The idea was conceived by astrono-
mers at the Princeton University Ob-
servatory. They decided that a floating
observatory — equipped with a tele-
scope-camera— would offer a stable
"work platform" from which sunspots
could be photographed free of the distor-
tion caused by the earth's atmosphere.
But "Project Stratoscope" encoun-
tered an unforeseen and major obstacle
on its initial flight. A foolproof method
was needed for aiming and focusing
the telescope of the unmanned observ-
atory. Princeton asked RCA to help.
A special RCA television system was
devised which enabled observers on the
ground to view exactly what the tele-
scope was seeing aloft. This accom-
plished, it was a simple matter to
achieve precise photography—directed
from the ground by means of a separate
RCA radio control system.
The resulting pictures reveal sun-
spot activities in unprecedented detail.
They provide the world with important
information regarding the magnetic
disturbances which affect navigation
and long-range communications.
The success of "Project Stratoscope"
is another example of RCA leadership
in advanced electronics. This leader-
ship, achieved through quality and
dependability in performance, has al-
ready made RCA Victor the most trusted
name in television. Today, RCA Victor
television sets are in far more homes
than any other make.

except for a gift to the local hospital. He
had a mathematical turn of mind, and
after the will was made, he had worked
the matter out and found that if he made
the hospital gift to his eldest son, he
would then have as much as the other
two sons. But if he had given it to the
second son, he would then have twice
as much as the other two, while if he
had given it to the youngest son, he
would have three times as much as the
other two. Now, if the man left a total
of SI800, can you calculate how much
each son and the hospital received as
their share?

A fellow was pretty sick and the
doctor ordered him to take a long vaca-
tion in Arizona. He went there and at
the end of two months he died.
They brought the corpse back and
his wife and her brothers were review-
ing the remains.
She said: "Oh, Joe, doesn't he look
nice.
And Joe replied: "He sure does.
Those two months in Arizona certainly
did him a lot of good."

I came over to help."
"Thanks, but I already got it upstairs."

up two flights of stairs? How could a
cat pull a heavy piano?"
"Used a whip."

A fraternity man promised his girl
he would cut down on his drinking.
About to call for his femme on a date
he found himself a bit looped.
"I'll sit down in the living room and
read," he thought. "Whoever heard of a
drunk reading a book?"
His date came down the stairs and
heard a noise from the living room.
"What in the world are you trying to
do?" she asked.
"Just reading, sweetie," he replied
happily.
"You drunken bum!" she yelled, as
she looked into the room. "Close that
suitcase and get out of here!"
During mock maneuvers an army com-
mander ordered a notice to be displayed
on a bridge stating: "This bridge has
been destroyed by air attack." But to his
chagrin, he noticed through his field
glasses that a foot regiment was crossing
the bridge despite his orders. He sent his
adjutant to the officer in charge post-
haste to find out how he dared to defy
his orders. An hour later the adjutant
was back. "It's all right, sir," he re-
ported. "The troops are wearing signs

Two duck hunters were sitting behind
their blind, one drinking from a thermos
bottle of coffee, the other from a jug
of whiskey. After some hours of sip-

through the sky. Taking quick aim, the
coffee drinker rose, let fire, and missed.
The whiskey drinker rose, let fire, and
brought the duck down. His companion,
properly amazed, complimented him on

smoked constantly. I did everything bad.
But I was saved, and now I don't dance,
I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't
sin anymore at all. In fact, I don't do
a darn thing but hang around here and

A mother, trying to keep her little
girl from sucking her thumb, told her
that if she didn't stop, she would blow
up and burst. A few days later, they
were riding on a bus, sitting opposite
a woman who was well on her way to
becoming a mother. There was a sudden
hush as the little girl looking at the

A new inmate checked in at an insane
asylum. Whereas most arrivals have a
sullen, non-cooperative attitude, this fel-
low was all smiles. In fact, he was laugh-
ing uproariously.
"Nearest kin?" queried the examining
physician.
"Twin brother," responded the other.
"We were identical twins. Couldn't tell
us apart. In school he'd throw spitballs
and the teacher would blame me. Once
he was arrested for speeding but the

(Continued from page 21)
must be, an integral part of an over-
all redevelopment plan—a continu-
ous, long-range plan. (Some people
fail to realize this about the Kalama-
zoo Mall.)
3) To convert a main traffic artery into
a pedestrian mall would be impossi-
ble for some cities until new alter-
native arteries were built—other cities
could reroute traffic with no loss of
flow or inconvenience. We were ac-
tually able to reroute traffic from our
main shopping street to two parallel
streets and gained better traffic flow.
"What has been the result of our Mall?
1) Pedestrian traffic on the 3 block mall
area has increased 30% according to
police department estimates and sam-
ple traffic counts;
2) downtown parking lot patronage has
increased approximately 10% over
the same period last year;
3) cars stay slightly longer in parking
lots than previously;
4) sample surveys indicate a 7 to 10%
increase in number of out-of-town
customers using downtown store
charge accounts;
5) rental rates have increased in some
sectors of downtown, especially near
or on the mall;
6) the number of vacant first floor stores
in the heart of downtown has de-
creased from 8 to 3;
7) surveys indicate some other interest-
ing factors—people tend to walk
more slowly on the mall than on ad-
jacent and similar streets and 37%
of the people walking on the mal!
will cross from one side to the other
at least once while going one block;
8) fourteen of the 40 stores on the mall
have done some remodeling of their
store fronts, two others have done
extensive remodeling and 3 more are
planning extensive remodeling. All
but one of these stores attribute their
decision to remodel primarily to the
development of the mall;
9) chain store real estate offices now
maintain that the previous 100%
location (on east side of street) now
applies to both sides of the mall;
10) our compilation of changes in gross
sales for all the downtown stores
show that for the 5 months since the

mall was completed, downtown sales
have increased 12.5% over the last
year, yet retail sales for the county
have increased only 5%. (Only one-
store on the mall showed a decrease
and only 5% in the entire down-
town.) Stores both on and off the mall
have increased more, on the average,
than the county average. On the mall
stores showed a somewhat higher in-
crease, however. This increase is
also significant because the last quar-
ter of 1958 was a very good year for
the Kalamazoo area retailwise—the
recession was apparently over here
by June of that year. December 1958
was, for example, a record month in
many respects.
11) In addition, we have upwards of
$30,000,000 in new office and retail
buildings in preliminary stages of
planning. One is an 18 story office
building with retail space on the
first floors."
Plan for 1980
By 1980 downtown Kalamazoo will be
unrecognizable. All private motor vehicles
will be banished to the peripheral ex-
pressways. Vast new parking areas will
sprout from the stumps of ancient fac-
tories and warehouses. The architecture
will have the look of science fiction
about it. Such a plan is so fabulous that
it seems fantastic, but then we have con-
crete proof of Kalamazoo's sincerity and
determination in the present mall.
What sort of a city is Kalamazoo,
that it boasts the nation's first perma-
nent (Toledo had a temporary mall)
installation of this type? Well, with
three colleges (Western Michigan Uni-
versity, Kalamazoo, Nazareth), substan-
tial industrial development (Upjohn,
several large paper mills, Shakespeare)
the city has a healthy economic base,
supported by a highly productive hin-
terland and a relatively large trading area.
Kalamazoo, in revitalizing its downtown,
was not striking back at suburban shop-
ping centers, but at loss of trade to
Grand Rapids, Battle Creek, and South
Bend. A pre-mall inquiry revealed that
500 Kalamazoo families had charge ac-
counts at a single large Grand Rapids
department store.
In a recent month (October 1959)
Kalamazoo posted the following eco-
nomic statistics: bank clearings, $200,-
000,000; postal receipts, 5200,000;
KWH consumption, 33,000,000; non-
farm labor force 63,000; 1,100 unem-
ployed; consumer price index, 125.5;
county retail sales, $21,000,000; railroad
freight carloads, 3,200 in, 1,400 out.
However, the most unusual Kalama-
zoo fact is not a statistic, nor is it history.
It is the remarkable future that this re-
markable city is forging for itself.

HE GETS COMPUTERS TO
DIAGNOSE THEIR OWN FAULTS
With the increasing size and complexity of modern computers, one
of the most interesting problems that engineers face is the rapid
and efficient location of failures within the system.
The method which they have found most practical is to use the
speed and logical abilities of the computer itself to make the
diagnosis. Programming computers to perform this function is the
job of Robert M. King.
The Diagnostic Technique
He prepares programs for the computer which actually simulate
the deductive processes of a man investigating the faults of the
machine. Each program instructs the computer to exercise various
segments of its circuitry in a logical order.
The result of each test is checked against the correct result, stored
in the computer memory, of previous tests of the same circuitry
when in proper working order. If the results do not agree, a mes-
sage is automatically typed which indicates the failure and which
component caused it.
A computer is particularly adept at this job. It can take into con-
sideration simultaneously a large number of factors. It can also
work at very high speeds. Once a program is properly written, the
computer makes no errors. Appropriately enough, diagnostic pro-
gramming often aids in designing better computers.
A Programmer's Background
Computer programs are the result of ingenious applications of
many intellectual qualities. Computer design and language are
based on sound laws of logic. Therefore an important prerequisite
is the ability to analyze complex problems and to deduce from them
useful methods of solution consistent with machine requirements.
If you think you might be interested in working in one of the many
fascinating areas of computer programming, you are invited to
talk it over with an IBM representative. The future can be as un-
limited as the future of the computer itself.

20,000, the value of the house to be
built on the land will jump from $17,500
to $27,500. The result of this procedure
is to decrease the gap between new ex-
penses and new taxes. Before, we men-
tioned that subdividing 100 acres at four
houses per acre resulted in $175,000 of
expenses and $80,000 in taxes. By up-
zoning the land so that only one house
per acre can be built, the result is $28,000
in new taxes but only $44,000 in ex-
penses. This can make a big difference
in a growing community's pocketbook.
A second plan used by some commu-
nities is to increase building-permit fees
to a high enough level to pay most of
the extra costs. However, this method
seems to be of dubious value, both
legally and financially. For example, the
Michigan Supreme Court recently tossed
out a building permit fee increase from
$26 to $91.50 by St. Clair Shores.
A third idea that has been tried is to
force the developers to set aside land
in the development for parks, schools
and other public areas. Most of the de-
velopers are against this plan and feel
they should be fairly compensated for
the land. The developers already provide
curbs, streets, water mains, etc., and
will almost certainly take the "land do-
nation" issue to court.
Admittedly these three methods of at-
tack are generally of dubious value and
are put into effect with little thought
or planning. Probably they would slow
up any urban blight but, in the long
run, they might make the mess-opolis
worse.
What then do we have to look for-
ward to? With a massive population
growth now in process, the answer is
almost certain to be an unhappy one,
unless some concentrated thought and
planning is done. Already we can see the
forerunners of what is to come in the
New York-Philadelphia area, the Balti-
more-Washington area, and mess-opolis
in its most advanced state, the Ios An-
geles area. And this is just the start. The
worst is yet to come. The situation de-
mands ACTION, not by the city planners
alone, but by citizens from all wdks of
life as well.
What action should be taken? It
seems that three important areas need
urgent consideration. The first is a re-
evaluation of metropolitan goveinment
with the aim of establishing super-gov-
ernments or at least super-agencies or
authorities to handle area-wide problems,
including overall planning. The second
is serious consideration of Whyte's "open-
spaces" proposal, which is discussed be-
low. The third is the assuming of an
active role in this realm by professional,
political and service organizations as well
as by individuals.
As far as super-governments are con-
cerned, we are not likely to go too far
in this direction. Most people feel they
can "reach and control" local government
Barry Peebles, a graduate of
Blissfield (Michigan) High School,
is the editor-in-chief of the Tech-
nic. He assumed the duties of this
office after serving as associate
editor and articles editor. A senior

to do graduate work in Business
Administration and eventually get

and don't want it removed from their
reach. On the other hand, people in
general seem willing to accept regional
government for such things as flood con-
trol, traffic systems, sewage systems, and
smog control. For this reason it seems
that any trend toward regional authoiity
will be in the area of special-purpose
agencies.
Several times William Whyte's "open
space" proposal has been mentioned but
never really defined. As discussed before,
it is his feelings that we have plenty of
land if we intelligently plan its use so
that the "urban sprawl" effect is mini-
mized and the original natural beauty
is maintained. He cites as an example,
maintaining a stream and its valley as the
logical centerpiece of an area, while still
allowing developments on the fringes
and in the surrounding hills—a plan
beneficial to farmers, conservation and
watershed groups, and even the devel-
opers.
Of course, the big problem is how to
keep, the open-space area from being de-
veloped. Whyte suggests the use of a
nearly-forgotten legal tool—the easement.
Seldom used in the East, the easement-
buying rights to a property—is gaining
wide acceptance on the West Coast. For
instance, in the example of the valley
mentioned, the neighboring owners might
buy up the rights to subdivide the valley
and thus prevent an eyesore development
or an industrial invasion. The easement
means that the valley property owner is
free to sell or do as he pleases with the
land, except that he and subsequent own-
ers will not be able to subdivide the
land into a development.
Whyte points out that careful plan-
ning by both professional groups and by
lay people can result in maintaining the
countryside and still provide room for
suburbs without giving them a crowded,
helter-skelter look.
This group of suggestions—govern-
mental re-evaluation, the open-space
plan, and widespread thought, is not in-
tended to be complete nor is it certain
to be the best way of attacking the prob-
lem. Nevertheless, the fact remains that
the events of today are shaping the results
of tomorrow. Similarly, the action and
planning that we, the people, take today
will largely determine if suburbia is to
be a blessing .... or a blight.

The answer to this teaser involves the
use of two equations with three un-
knowns. The student therefore must
guess one of the unknowns.
Let A equal the number of clubs to
be bought.
Let B equal the number of club covers
to be bought.
Let C equal the number of golf balls
to be bought.
Two equations are found to be:
A plus B plus C = 100
10A plus 3B plus l/2C = 100
Now you can buy 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 golf
clubs, since you must buy at least one
and buying six would not give you
enough money to buy up to 100 pieces
of equipment. Substituting these values
into the equations and solving them for
the covers and balls, only gives you an
answer which is in whole numbers for
the cover and balls. Therefore you should
buy 5 clubs, 1 cover, and 94 balls.

Take advantage of the
MECHANICAL
ADVANTAGE
The screw is a combination of two
mechanical principles: the lever,
and the inclined plane in helical
form. The leverage applied to the
nut combines with motion of the nut
around the bolt to exert tremendous
clamping force between the two.
One of the greatest design errors
today, in fact, is failure to realize
the mechanical advantages that
exist in standard nuts and bolts.
Smaller diameters and less costly
grades of fasteners tightened to
their full capacity will create far
stronger joints than those utilizing
bigger and stronger fasteners tight-
ened to only a fraction of their
capacity. Last year, one of our engi-
neers showed a manufacturer how
he could save $97,000 a year simply
by using all the mechanical advan-
tages of a less expensive grade.
When you graduate, make sure
you consider the mechanical advan-
tages that RB&amp;W fasteners provide.
And make sure, too, that you con-
sider the career advantages RB&amp;W
offers mechanical engineers—in the

of mechanical fasteners. If you're

HONORARIES: An
Each spring not long after the species Collegium StuAtnth
and other forms of wildlife return to the Northland from a Florida
sojourn, campus life is momentarily disrupted as red-faced, black-
gowned, or tree-bearing bands of students come forth from their
inner sanctums on moonless nights to pull quivering, half-dad
undergrads from their beds. Thus with ringing bells, secret chants,
and symbolic campfires the tapping of new members for the
activity honoraries is in full swing.
One or two days later the Diag erupts with more red bodies,
dunce-capped heads, or soot and grease-covered bodies, all proclaim-
in no uncertain words their allegiance to this or that and the fact
that they can drink forty beers. Then with honor fully bestowed
upon their humble souls the neophytes, now full grown blood
bothers, retire to the secret chambers and once again quiet returns
to the campus.
And so it has been since 1904 or some other year long, long
ago.
Quite likely, this year will be no different. The next several
weeks should see this annual spring rite come and go as it has
down through the ages. But as underclassmen wait hopefully and
upperclassmen look forward to their revenge it might be beneficial
to pause briefly to consider the activity honoraries and ask a few
questions that probably haven't been asked for a good many years.
First of all, why should we have activity honoraries? Are they
desirable? Necessary? It seems impossible to deny that honoraries
have become a part of our campus culture and, baring something
unforseen, are here to stay. Yet, one wonders at times why they
were started and for what purpose. The logical answer to this
seems to be "to honor those students who have excelled in extra-
curricular activities." Similarly, the scholastic honoraries honor
those students who have excelled academically.
There can be little argument with the idea of honoring those
who excel in a particular area. In fact, much of our society is
based on this idea of reward and honor for our achievements. Grant-
ing this, it will probably be generally agreed that the activity hon-
oraries are desirable and do fulfill an objective but there may be
some doubt whether or not they are necessary. They certainly aren't
necessary for the functioning of the University nor would the
activities themselves cease to flourish without the honoraries. The
"necessity" of these groups seems to be put in further doubt if
there only purpose is to perpetuate themselves.
This fact leads us to a second question—should honoraries
have any purpose other than the self perpetuation of the organ-
ization? Do they, as a group of student leaders, have any obli-
gation to the University and the College? Some honoraries con-
stitutions state that they do, others allude to this idea? But how
many of these groups ever show any interest outside of the "inner
circle" (except to make money)? Of course, there are instances
of sincere interest and service but they are few and far between. It
seems that the honoraries, as the "chosen few" do have an obligation
of service to their college (and the student body) and that they
should have some purpose other than just to perpetuate themselves.
Without some more basic purpose than self-glorification of the
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


members the whole idea seems too much like a childish waste of
time.
Finally, it might be asked if the traditional tapping and
initiation ceremonies are a fitting method for a college-educated
professional group of men to honor their successors? Certainly
it will be agreed that the various ceremonies are traditional and
have become an intergal part of some groups but one wonders some-
times just how much honor is added by these ceremonies? Are
they really consistent with the behavior and attitudes of college
seniors?
In the preceding paragraphs a number of questions have been
asked, some of which may appear to be anti-honorary. This is not
the intent—they are not anti-honorary. It is hoped, however, that
the)- will provoke some serious thinking among students, faculty,
and among the honoraries themselves about the honoraries: their
purpose, their reason for existance, and the role they should play on
our campus in the mid-twentieth century.

Once again this spring the SGC election turnout hit a new
low for the umpteenth time. We wonder how much longer this must
go on before the people connected with "Stu G" realize that this
is a direct reflection of student dissatisfaction with the results of
SGC's efforts in the last couple of years. Most people agree with
the concept of a student government but it seems that few agree that
SGC is a good implementation of this concept. We've urged before,
and we will again, that engineers and engineering organizations
take an active hand in making student government a useful and
worthwhile organization.

Congratulations are in order to several people for election or
appointment to positions in campus activities, including Roger
Barnes who was recently elected President of the Senior Class for
the coming year. Rog has been President of the Engineering Council
during the present semester.
Also deserving of credit is Tom Dejonghe for making the Arch
an up-and-coming publication. Tom took over as Editor after the
Arch had been "defunct" for a semester and, along with an ener-
getic staff, has made it into a worthwhile paper.

Don't forget to be on the lookout for Engineers Weekend on
May 13-15. All indications point to a fine and rewarding schedule
of events and group of exhibits.

We wonder how many of the engineering groups and societies
have been having trouble getting announcements and news items
in the Daily lately. At least two groups we know have been getting
the cold shoulder while almost identical items from Lit school
groups have been published. It seems like it's about time for the
engineering groups to voice, in no uncertain terms, our dissatis-
faction with this "discrimination."

New hairlike metal crystals are showing re-
searchers how to extract maximum strength
from metal structues. One result could be inter-
planetary vehicles whose weight is reduced by
eighty per cent.

Metallurgists are continually striv-
ing to achieve the highest possible
strength in metallic structural materials.
The usual approach, of course, has been
the experimentation with alloys and pro-
cessing methods. The newest approach,
however, has excited considerable in-
terest because it deals with the atomic
cohesion within a pure metal.
Experimentation on atomic cohesion
in metals is focused today on tiny, single
crystal filaments called whiskers. It is
within these hair-like strands of metal
that atomic cohesion has been found to
be nearly perfect, that is, nearly as strong
as has been theoretically calculated. So
enthusiastic are researchers about whis-
kers that they are predicting the utili-
zation of whisker composites for struc-
tural purposes (sheeting, cables, etc.)
with possible reductions in weight to
one-fifth of that found in today's modern
designs. One can readily see the advan-
tage of their inclusion in aircraft and
missiles.
But why is atomic cohesion the key
to great strength? This can best be
answered by a look at the atomic struc-
ture of metals, called a lattice. Referring
to the diagram of a crystal lattice, picture
an atom at every line intersection. The
lattice then is seen to be a three dimen-
sional stacking of cubes (or cells) in this
most simple structure of metal. Obvious-
ly these cubes must be held together to
form the metal. This is what atomic co-
hesion is—the bonding force between
atoms within a cell, and cells within a
lattice.
In the usual forms of metal (beams,
sheets, etc.,) this bonding force between
atom-cell-lattice is imperfect. This faulty
bonding, and thus weakness in the entire
metal structure, is a result of lattice
imperfections such as missing atoms, de-
formed lattices due to crystal crowding
during solidification, or dislocations—
more atoms in one row than in the ad-
joining row.
Due to their methods of growth or
formation, whiskers, on the other hand,
have lattice structures which are nearly
perfect, permitting the full value of
atomic cohesion to be realized. This re-
sulting strength can be one thousand
times that found in ordinary metals.
That whiskers are single crystals elim-
inates the crowding and subsequent
deformation of their lattice. The single
crystal structure of whiskers can be
shown by x-ray inspection as well as by
the fact that the electrical conductivity
in most cases equals that found in single
crystals of ordinary metal structures. To
demonstrate the size of these tiny metal
hairs, a sapphire whisker might meas-
ure one to three millimeters in length
and from three to fifty microns in

When the crystal lattice is imperfect, there is weakness in the entire metal
structure. Here the imperfection is due to missing atoms.
width.4 (Consider the period at the end
of this sentence to be about one thousand
microns in diameter.)
With this general idea of just what a
whisker is, and why it is comparatively
stronger than metals of other forms, let
us study their mechanical formation. Let
us begin by assuming we have just one
of the cells (cubes) of a future lattice.
Due to their growth from a vapor, the
new cells which will pile up to form
the crystals, can align themselves with-
out interference from solid material.
Now, like anything else which is easier
to do because it is already partly done,
these new cells will form where there
might already be part of a cell. And if
the one cell we are starting with has a
slight dislocation, this will provide an
excellent position for the new cell to
grow. Let us also assume that as these
cells add on to the original cell, they
more greatly correct the dislocation the
farther from it they grow. As new cells
continue to build where dislocations are
more predominant, the resulting struc-
ture will surround the original disloca-
tion, spiraling upward from the first
layer of cells. This causes a spiraling
growth at the whisker tip around one
screw dislocation (called screw probably
because of the resulting spiral, or screw-
ing growth). This type of growth elim-
inates the weakening edge dislocations
found in ordinary crystals.
Turning now to the chemistry of their
production we find that whiskers of var-
ious metals, silicon, and germanium, are
grown from their own vapor by chemical
reactions which occur, at least partially,
in the vapor phase. A foreign gas is also
usually introduced into the reactions. Let
us consider the growth of sapphire
whiskers: small amounts of aluminum
are heated to 1300-1450 C, in a stream
of hydrogen for from two to twenty-four
hours, and the formation of relatively
large, downy deposits of transparent and
translucent crystals surrounding the
charge for about 2 cm. is observed. These
crystals, needle-like in appearance, are
sapphire whiskers. This reaction is es-
sentially an oxidation of aluminum, in-
volving the volatile molecule Aeo. The
stability of their chemical composition
was proven when the tip of one of these
crystals was melted with the electron
beam under the electron microscope. The
melted A1203 resolidified to a single
crystal. The crystallographic orientation
differed from that of the needle, how-
ever, due to the difference in formation,
or growth.1 Zinc and cadmium, plus
other metal whiskers, are grown from a
controlled supersaturation of the vapors
of these metals or their compounds in
the presence of a foreign gas. This is the
precipitation or vapor deposition meth-
od.3 Silver, iron, and copper whiskers
have been grown by electrolytic deposi-
tion from molten salt solutions of these
metals. The chemical reduction of metal
halides, chlorides, iodides, and bromides,
by means of the passage of hydrogen or
some other reducing agent such as zinc,
will also result in filamentary whisker
growth. A third method has been ob-
served: Some metals when subject to
extremely high stress will produce whis-
kers from their base, i.e., from the bulk
of the metal. This phenomenon was first
observed in tin, cadmium, zinc, and other
soft metals. A fourth possibility, though
not in use yet, is the hot drawing of fila-
ments from their liquid phase. Consid-
erable strength has been obtained in some
materials, such as fibers of glass com-
pounds, by this method.1
Strength in small crystals was rec-
ognized in the nineteenth century, but
not until the past decade has this strength
been observed to go up steeply as crystal
sizes were reduced to less than .0001
inches. (The probability of forming more
perfect crystals probably increases tre-
mendously with further reductions in
size.) Within the last three years whisk-
ers have been tested at levels near the
atomic cohesion strength.1 To gain an
idea of this progress, the following dia-
gram is presented:
The postulated theory that whiskers
have only screw dislocations along their
longitudinal axis, and almost no edge
faults, together with the restraining
forces on the crystal surfaces due to the
low incidence of edge dislocations, gives
rise to a method of predicting the
strength of whiskers. The method in-
volves the reflection of light from the
crystal surfaces. If this is irregular
it indicates the occurence of surface
fractures, thus reduucing the whisker's
strength. A prediction of strength can,
of course, be made from observing a uni-
form surface reflection of light. The
sapphire crystals mentioned earlier re-
tained their smooth appearance even
under great magnification, indicating
their capacity to withstand tremendous
tensile stresses. Of course, any condition
on the surface of the crystal, such as
pits, overgrowth, and whisker branches,
products of corrosion, or grain boun-
daries, if they should occur, would
greatly influence the whisker's strength.2
It should also be mentioned here that
the length of a whisker will affect its
strength. The smaller the whisker, the
greater will be its tensile strength some-
times by as much as a factor of four.
Before entering into some examples
of whisker strength, we should realize
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


field. Strength is defined as the maximum
stress the whisker sustained before frac-
ture occurred. Let us also examine the
method of comparing the strength of
whiskers to that of present structural
materials. This is usually done by taking
the ratio of the value of stress to the
value of the material's modulus of elas-
ticity. As an example, consider iron and
its present breaking strength, taken to
be around 60,000 psi. Its modulus is
30,000,000 psi. The above ratio becomes
1/500. Taking the same ratio, with re-
spect to an iron whisker having a tensile
strength of 1,900,000 psi, we have a
fraction of about 1/15, obviously depict-
ing a much higher strength.
Various theoretical calculations of the
upper strength limit of perfect materials
utilizing full atomic cohesion yield an
ultimate tensile stress anywhere from
1/10 to 1/40 of the modulus of elas-
ticity, depending upon the material in
question.
The following chart of some of the
strongest whiskers that have been ex-
perimentally tested includes this ratio of
stress to modulus, showing the degree of
strength to which these crystals have been
perfected.

Sapphire 74,000,000 1,700,000 1/43
(reference 1, p. 595)
In the above chart, it has been shown
that the strongest iron, copper, and silver
whiskers have exhibited tensile strengths
which are either close to or above the
lower estimate of the strength of perfect
crystals. This stress-strain behavior is
taken as a sign that the theoretical
strength of perfect whiskers has been
closely approached.
Other tests have shown a strength in
NaCl whiskers of 110 Kg/mm2, and a
silicone strength of 390 Kg/mm2, which
approximate the above table value.2 Re-
search is also being done at the National
Carbon Research Laboratories in Parma,
Ohio. Here a graphite whisker has been
stressed to 40,000 psi, by means of a
copper bead electroplated onto the whis-
ker. Other graphite whiskers have sus-
tained stresses of up to 500,000 psi.
These filamentary crystals had cross-sec-
tional dimensions of 4.5 by 0.55
In addition to strength in tensile stress,
many other notable properties of whis-
kers have been observed or inferred from
the assumed absence of edge dislocations.
Some of these follow:

have shown a much larger plastic de-
formation range, as opposed to the elas-
tic strains which most compounds are
able to withstand up to their point of
yielding.
2. The modulus of elasticity of a
whisker has, in some cases, been shown
to differ radically from that of larger
polycrystalline amounts of the same
material, due to the uniform orientation
of the whisker crystal axis. In various
instances the value of the modulus has
been halved or doubled.
3. A final and extremely important
property of whiskers is the absence of
creep below the normal recrystalization
temperature. This would imply the re-
tention of considerable strength at ele-
vated temperatures, even close to the
melting point.1
As might be indicated by the tremen-
dous stresses which whiskers are able
to sustain, together with the other prop-
erties just mentioned, the future possi-
bilities of whiskers, or structural com-
posites of whiskers, are unlimited.
George A. Hoffman, aeronautical engi-
neer at the Rand Corporation, refers to
whiskers as the possible "building blocks
of the astronauts."1 There is of course
much more interest in weight reduction
in the fields of aviation and space travel
than elsewhere. The properties of whis-
kers, included in supposed material to be
made from them in the future, permit a
comparison of the weights of tension
structures made from them, and that of
structures made from conventional ma-
terials. The possibility of a reduction to
one-fifth of today's normal structural
weight seems feasible, and is of great
interest in the design and construction
of astronautical vehicles, where weight
reduction can mean a considerable per-
formance improvement.
Furthering this idea, the loading of
space ships and planes results in struc-
tures designed from tension criteria.
Whisker tensile strength could well be
utilized in the construction of tanks,
cabins, and other items which are or
might be tension loaded as the result of
pressurization and other factors. If each
of these structures could be reduced to
one-fifth of its present design weight,
the saved four-fifths might be reinstated
as fuel, or payload of the last stage in
the case of rockets. This would increase
the payload, or the range, without

Whiskers exhibit a perfect crystal lattice, allowing the full value of atomic co-
hesion to be realized. The resulting strength can be as much as one thousand
times that found in ordinary metals.

Experiments have shown empirically that ESP
is not just a creation of the science fiction writ-
er: it's a startling reality.

Out of reach of man's conscious
mind lie strange and mysterious
forces of the mind. For centuries people
have tried to use these forces, the sorcer-
ers of Medieval times, the gypsy fortune
tellers, even the great philosophers of
ancient Greece toyed with the idea of
putting them to use. It was thought that
only a few selected people could posses
these powers of the mind. These forces
are what psychologists of today call psi
phenomena. Until the beginning of the
great scientific revolution, most people
would not think of questioning the
existence of psi, but the great advances
in science made during the nineteenth
century caused people to change this
attitude. Science could offer no proof or
explanation for the phenomena, there-
fore it was assumed that they did not
exist.
Despite this negative attitude, case
upon case of strange experiences were
reported by people from all over the
world. Someone would dream of a dis-
aster and pass it off as a bad dream,
only to have it occur exactly as he saw it
in the dream. Everyday occurences, such
as two people saying exactly the same
thing at the same time or the woman
who goes to call her neighbor on the
phone only to have the friend call her
just as she reaches for the phone, were
all passed off as mere coincidence. But
were they coincidence? From a highly
reputable source comes the story of the
mother who was at a bridge party, when
she was seized by an uncontrollable urge
to call her maid to see if her baby was
all right. She felt that she could not
continue the game until she called. After
struggling through the hand, she dashed
to the telephone and called the maid
who assured her that everything was
okay. Two hours later, when she arrived
home, there was a small gathering of
people in the front of her home. Apolo-
getically the maid explained that about
two hours before (at approximately the
same time the mother had the strong urge
to call) the baby had fallen from the
carriage and had caught his feet so that
he was hanging head down from the
carriage. The baby had been there for
quite a while when a policeman came
along and released the crying child from
his precarious position. A few more min-
utes in that position would have meant
death for the child. Because the baby
was not seriously injured, the maid with-
held the information from the mother
at the time of the call to avoid spoiling
the party. Can this nearly exact coinci-
dence of time be due to chance?
The vast majority of people preferred
to call these events coincidence. How-
ever, to a few undaunted psychologists
and other interested men the question
lingered: were there really such forces
as these psi phenomena? Man's behavior
had always been associated with the
physical world. All of his actions were
thought to be responses to physical stim-
uli such as sound, sight, smell and touch.
But one thing could not be explained by
such stimuli—the thinking process. What
was the mind? What brought about the
thinking process? Was it possible that
the mind was not a physical thing? Was
there a means of contact between men
without a physical awareness? Within
the last 75 years man has finally started
to seek answers to these questions. Final-
ly, after centuries, an explanation is being
sought.
In answer to these questions, a new
branch of psychology has developed,
known as parapsychology, which is de-
voted to the study of psi, or psychic,
phenomena. Psi has two main aspects:
mental and physical. The mental effects
are those which are scientifically known
as extra-sensory perception, or ESP, and
include: telepathy, which is the aware-
ness of the thoughts or the mental state
of another person, clairvoyance, or ESP

of an object or event, and precognition,
or the prediction of events which have
not happened. The physical effects are
known as psychokinesis or PK and are
concerned with the influence of mind
on matter.
Early Experiments
The first attempt to experimentally ver-
ify the existence of ESP was made by a
non-academic society which was founded
with the intent purpose of conducting
experiments on various psi phenomena.
This society, known as the Society for
Psychical Research, was founded in 1882
in England and became one of the first
organized groups to investigate ESP.
Their experiments were concerned with
telepathy; they did not try to explain it,
but rather, prove its existence thereby
showing that the mind was more than a
physical thing. At the time of their ex-
periments, the common idea was that
telepathy was associated with hypnotism;
hence the tests were carried out on sub-
jects placed under mild hypnosis.
One of the more well known experi-
menters was a French physician, Dr. E.
Azam, whose experiments were con-
cerned with the identification of sug-
gested physical things while the subject
was under the influence of hypnosis. It
was known that a person in such a state
was very susceptible to the power of
suggestion. For example, if the scent
of perfume were passed under a sub-
ject's nose and the experimenter told the
subject he could smell nothing, then
the subject would not respond to the
stimulus. This is what Dr. Azam's ex-
periments consisted of, but instead of
telling the subject he would think about
it and test the subject's reaction to his
transmitted thoughts. He would place
a subject under hypnosis and then think
of a smell. The subject was told to
respond when he was aware of the stim-
ulus. He also tried the experiment
thinking of a pain in a certain part of the
subject's body. The subject would re-
spond by attempting to relieve the dis-
comfort. The results, though not con-
clusive, indicated that it was possible,
in many cases, to transmit thoughts with-
out physical means. He succeeded in a
large number of trials in getting positive
responses to his thoughts.
One of the most dramatic of the
early experiments which pointed toward
the existence of ESP was an early telep-
athy test carried out by Dr. Pierre Janet
or Sorbonne University in Paris. Dur-
ing this experiment he succeeded in
hypnotizing a number of subjects at a
long distance and in separate rooms.
Again the results were not sufficient to
build a solid case for ESP, but they did
indicate that the existence of ESP was a
very strong possibility.
Later experimenters, working with the
identification of random numbers and
cards, discovered that hypnotism was
not necessary. Experiments were carried
out where subjects were to identify cards
and numbers that the experimenters were
thinking of. The number of correct
identifications far exceeded the number
that would have been accepted if identi-
fication were governed only by chance.
Despite this evidence in favor of ESP,
public opinion was still negative. It was
too far fetched for the people of the
time. Some contended that the experi-
ments were fixed and others said they
weren't accurately controlled, but the
men who conducted them had little to
gain from fraud, and all were highly
respectable and reputable men of the
academic world.
The attitude of indifference and skep-
ticism held until the early 1920's. The
pinnacle of American gaiety during the
Roaring 20's brought a sudden rise in
such things as spiritualism and seances.

Ion exchange is making possible many new
chemical processes, and bettering existing
ones.
By DON WITHERS
Ion exchange, although recognized for
several hundred years, has recently
become one of the major processes of
chemistry and chemical engineering. Ele-
ments can be industrially separated more
conveniently than by other chemical
means, water can be desalted and made
extremely pure, rare earths and radio-
active elements can be recovered from
low-grade ores, and many processes arc-
made possible which previously were
too expensive. Even unwanted excesses
in the body can be controlled to an
extent by means of ion exchange.
History
The ion exchange properties of the
natural zeolite minerals have been known
for several hundred years. In the Mid-
dle Ages it was known that when hard
water, i.e. containing magnesium, iron,
calcium, etc., was run through a bed
of zeolite these hardness-producing ions
were removed from the water and "soft"
sodium ions put in the water in their
place by the zeolite. Eventually the zeolite
would give up all its sodium ions and
become saturated with the hard ones,
becoming useless.
Eventually it was discovered that the
zeolite could be regenerated by running
a strong salt solution through the ex-
hausted bed. The excess of sodium ions
forced out the hard ones and took their
place, thus making the bed ready for
another cycle. This process, with several
refinements was first proposed for in-
dustrial use back in 1905 on a large
scale for industrial water purification.
Many other minerals and soils were
studied for their exchange properties in
the 1800's. But these materials were
limited in usefulness and practical appli-
cations, usually serving in specific pro-
cesses.
The big breakthrough in the use of ion
exchange came with the synthesis of
resins of controllable exchange properties.
The large amount of research into these
synthetic resins has resulted in many
new applications as well as allowing a
higher purity than found in the natural
minerals. Some of the more interesting
applications will be discussed later on
in this paper.
Ion Exchange Mechanism
As the name implies, ion exchange
resins exchange ions, trading certain
exchangeables resin ion groups for ions
of like charge in a solution passing
through the resin. During manufacture
a polymer, or plastic, is saturated with
many easily exchanged ion groups (in
this case, H'). When a solution con-
taining ions to be removed is passed
through a resin column the new ions,
being more strongly attracted to the
resin than the H" groups, trade places
with them on the resin. The H' ions
are washed out of the resin as an acid
solution. (Ex. — NaCl solution +
HRESIN = HC1 solution + NaTesin).
Refer to Figure 1. On elution, or regener-
ation of the resin, a solution of surplus
H* ions is passed through the resin

leaving the original solution and the
original resin. Note that the above ex-
planation makes no mention of the con-
ditions for one ion to be attracted to
the resin in preference to another. pH, or
concentration of the H' solution, choice
of eluting solution and many other fac-
tors must be considered.
The above example considers a cation
exchange resin (positively charged ions).
The resin exchanges positive ions and
can be considered to be a large negative
resin with an equilibrium number of
positive H' ions attached. Similarly, an-
ion exchange resins exchange negatively
charged ions and radicals. (Ex—OH-
resin + H'acid = acidic resin + H20).
Cation exchange resins mostly ex-
change the oxidized forms of metals and
earths while the anion forms exchange
negative acid radicals and metal com-
plexes. Cation resins are usually regen-
erated by acids while anion resin re-
quire bases.
Of what use is such a phenomenon?
One common use is the concentrating of
solutions, especially when the desired
ion is present in only a few parts per
million. This is often the case in the
preparation of radioactive elements in
an atomic reactor, where the very rare
elements are produced in minute amounts.
A resin is chosen to absorb the desired
ion directly from the working solution.
As the volumes of solution are run
through the column, the ion will be
stockpiled on the resin. When eluted
with only a few bed volumes of the
proper solution the ion will be washed
out in a concentration usually over a
hundred times greater than in the orig-

inal solution. Chemical precipitation is
usually now economical to complete the
recovery.
Separation of Elements
The following is an example of how
three solutions can be separated from
each other by controlling the HC1 con-
tent of the solutions. Consider a solution
of cobalt, nickel, and iron chlorides.
It is desired to separate them into three
chloride solutions.
Let us first use chemical means to
obtain the desired results. One element
must first be precipitated out of solution
selectively and filtered out. A second
element must be similarly removed
from the third element. The three ele-
ments are now separated, but they are
not in the form desired. Proper chem-

ical reactions must be chosen to put the
three elements in chloride solutions and
prevent other chemicals from contam-
inating the selution. The separation has
taken at least seven steps and most like-
ly several more.
Now let us use an ion exchange resin
for this purpose. The three graphs below
show the percent absorption of the three
elements as a function of the percent
HCI in the solution. Add HCI to the
solution until about 4 to 5 molar. As
can be seen from the graphs, Iron (III)
will be absorbed while the nickel and
cobalt will pass on through the column.
Now elute the iron with a very weak
solution of HCI. The iron is in the
form desired. When the remaining solu-
tion is made more than six molar and
passed through the column, the nickel
comes out as the desired solution while
the cobalt is retained on the resin. An-
other elution with very weak HCI re-
moves the cobalt as the desired solution.
Note that seven steps were also required,
but the solutions are in the form desired.
This process itself is not economically
feasible since precipitation is cheaper,
but it serves to illustrate separations by
ion exchange. But when a solution of
rare earths is to be separated, as many
as several hundred precipitation and
crystallization steps may be required. In
such a case, ion exchange is often the
only means of large scale production at
a reasonable cost.
Water Softening and Deionizing
Ion exchange finds much use in
water treatment, especially in the deion-
ization of water to very high purities. As
has been stated before, the use of zeolites

PROBABILITY
All day long! . . . yes? . . . no? . . . cross the
street? ... go to class? ... hamburger or grilled
cheese? . . But how do we do it?
By RICHARD KARPINSKI
Decisions are said to be the results
of rational logical thinking pro-
esses. But thinking processes are notori-
ous for sometimes being neither rational
nor logical. However, recently, some
revealing studies have been made on the
topic, notably Theory of Games and
Economic Behavior by John von Neu-
mann and Oskar Morgenstern. After
the field became a reputable area of study,
many others entered and added their
discoveries, sometimes contradictory,
sometimes useless, but often meaning-
ful, adding insights into the nature of
man.
Perhaps the easiest and most instruc-
tive area to begin with is gambling: One
might assume that a person would enter
into a wager only when he had a rea-
sonable chance of winning. Thus if I
were to stake $1.00 that I would turn
up the Ace of Spades on one cut of a
standard deck, 1 would require my
opponent to stake $51.00 or more that
I would not. However, there are several
types of cases where this does not happen.
Richard Karpinski, a transfer
student from Michigan Tech, is a
sophomore majoring in math.
While at Tech he was named to
Phi Eta Sigma, a freshman honor
society.
As a student at Mumford High
School in Detroit, he was active
in the Math and Chess Clubs.
Among his interests he includes
coin collecting, archery, science
fiction, and cycling.

In fact, the exceptions include the great
majority of the events in question. Let
us consider these exceptions to appar-
ently rational thinking.
First, suppose I am a very rich man
(so that $50 or $100 means little to
me), but at the moment I have only
$1.00 in my wallet which I intend to
use as cab fare for the two mile trip
home. A man approaches me and offers
to pay me $100 if I can call a card and
then turn it over correctly, on the con-
dition that if I lose I pay him $1.00.
Obviously, on a purely logical level I
should accept the wager immediately. I
think, however, "if I win, it will mean
little to me, but if I lose, I shall have
to walk home. Under these conditions
I do not accept the wager.
On the other hand, if I have only one
dollar to my name and it is important
to me that I get to Milwaukee as soon
as possible, (by air: $25.00), I accept
the wager even at $25 or $30 when
statistics and probabilities say I get the
worst of the deal.
A third type, which might be called
a limited information situation, is ex-
emplified by two men wagering over the
outcome of an election: the Democrat
thinks sincerely that Stevenson has a
60/40 chance of winning, while the
Republican feels that Eisenhower has a
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


cept bets slightly against their favor, each
thinking that he is more likely to win.
The New Development
Since in each of the three above cases,
simple mathematical probability theory
will not suffice to predict or even explain,
the actions of the people involved, we
need some other explanation. One the-
ory which has developed begins by
asserting that we can measure feelings in
units of pleasure and regret. Thus in the
first case above, $100 might be worth
ten units of pleasure to the rich man,
while having to walk home would cause
one unit of regret. Since the odds of win-
ning the wager are less than one in ten,
the decision not to enter is reasonable.
The second case is similar in that the
loss of the dollar is not important while
the chance to get to Milwaukee is.
It is only in the third case, however,
that the real use of the theory is dis-
played. Here, since we have no data to
the contrary, we may for the moment
suppose that dollars and pleasure-regret
units correspond to each other, at least
roughly. This is not the problem. Despite
the fact that one of the participants
(or both) must have been wrong in his
evaluation of the true probabilities in
the election, if indeed there were any
"true probabilities," that is not the
problem we are concerned with either.
At the moment, we are concerned with
how we do make decisions, not how we
should. Here, the pleasure-regret units
are of real value, since they allow us to
evaluate pertinent but non-numerical cir-
cumstances. Both participants of the
last example, by virtue of being party
members, have alliances to uphold. This
means that whether or not they really
believe that their respective candidates
will win, they have an unspoken obliga-
tion to support them. In other words,
conditions outside the wager itself, and
not affecting the value of the outcome
are an integral part of the decision. Each
participant must decide how much the
scorn of his party members and the dis-
approval of his opponent and associates
means to him (in terms of pleasure re-
gret units) before he can begin to con-
sider the mathematical probabilities.
Professional Gambling and the Gambler
In professional gambling, Las Vegas
and Monte Carlo, horse racing and the
numbers racket to mention a few, the
odds are always against you: in craps
or roulette, only by four or five per-
cent; in the numbers game it may run
two or even ten to one against you. But
people keep on betting! In many cases
this may be completely rational and ex-
plicable. As in case two above, n dollars
may be worth more in pleasure units
than n times one dollar expressed in
pleasure units. For instance, as so often
the case is with numbers players, a man
may have a very poor income and live
under slum conditions. In such a situa-
tion, one thousand dollars would be
considerably more valuable than the one
dollar he might bet each week for twenty
years ($1041). Also, in the case of once
in a lifetime or occasional gamblers, there
is the entertainment value. The thrill
of watching the little ball decide whether
you win or lose may be worth accepting
the odds against you once in a while.
Then there is the gambler; he is the
first, so far, whose rationality is ques-
tionable. He is prone to believe in sys-
tems, and while there are a few win-
ning systems, they require that you have
at least more cash than the casino and
an exceedingly great amount of time to
throw the odds in your favor. We can-
not reasonably charge it to recreation
since he spends entirely too much time
and money at it, and generally is very
guilt ridden after realizing what has
happened.
One of the most general delusions,
among normal people too, is a misinter-
pretation of probability theory. When
we say, that in the long run, a coin will
fall heads half of the time, many people
think that after a long series of tails, it
becomes more and more probable that
the next toss will result in a head. This
is not so—the odds remain the same,
50/50. If you started out with one hun-
dred tails in a row, eventually there
would be so many tosses that one hun-
dred would be a very insignificant part
of the total; that is the meaning of the
statement" in the long run . . . ."
Practical Applications
What we have said so far may be of
interest but it really isn't too useful to
the average person. We may then ask:
(Continued on page 42)
To card players, the element of chance is an extremely
important factor. In poker, there is one chance in 4,164
of getting four of a kind, but only one in 649,739 of
receiving a royal flush. These seem insignificant when it is
known that the odds against a perfect bridge hand are
635,599.599 to one.

James Elam (M.S., Purdue '59) is studying various techniques of speech analysis at IBM.
The objective of this work is voice-machine communication.


^y* nmmvmnM
He's breaking through
sound barriers to
find new applications
of human speech
It is believed that once clear, distinct signals can be obtained from
human speech sounds, the human voice can be used for direct com-
munication with machines. James Elam is working in this direction.
Voice-Machine Communication Problems
The problems involved are formidable. Machine "understanding"
of human speech will be limited by both the sensitivity and the
number of electronic "recognizers" of speech-sound patterns that
can be built into the machine. To further complicate matters, the
human voice is capable of making an almost infinite variety and
subtlety of sound patterns. Only in theory could a machine be built
that could recognize all of them.
A Solution in "Phonemes"?
To further this work on voice-machine communication, James
Elam is studying various techniques of speech analysis. In one
scheme, recordings are made of voices reading words. These are
then examined in their frequency spectrum, and a power within
discrete bands is plotted. The plots, or spectrograms, are used
to break down words into basic sounds called "phonemes." Each
phoneme has a separate and distinct pattern and is capable of giv-
ing a clear signal. It is hoped that these signals can be used to
communicate directly, through an audio input, with machines.
Fascinating Assignments
Because of its exciting future possibilities, James Elam finds his

changing the gross weight at take-off.
It is only natural to consider at this
point the feasibility of the mass produc-
tion of whiskers and their composite
materials, if they are to be utilized in
the manner suggested. There must be no
insurmountable obstacles in the manu-
facture of the quantity, quality, and
forms of whiskers necessary for struc-
tural purposes. Consider, then, their
growth, alignment and collection, and
final binding into usable shapes or forms.
It is presently thought by those in
the field that under sufficient economic-
incentives all the methods of growth pre-
viously discussed in this paper will be
adaptable for plant mass production.
Furthermore, it is possible to devise
means for making the growth of whis-
kers orderly, thereby improving their
collectibility. Such factors as align-
ment, thinness, and length, can all be
controlled by proper temperatures, sat-
uration composition, and magnetic or
electrostatic fields. The harvesting or col-
lection of whiskers might be accom-
plished by vibratory or mechanical scrap-
ing techniques.1 Up to this point, the
whiskers would simply be in loose
bundles, perhaps held by friction or
electrostatic forces.
The first step in deriving a usable
whisker form would possibly be spin-
ning them into longer strands much like
textiles or glass fibers. These in turn
would be woven into cables or sheets,
still weak, however, for the lack of a
shear bond between fibers. There seems
to be two possibilities for achieving this
bond:
The first is the pressing and heating
of the woven mats or cables, similar to
the powder and fiber metallurgy known
today. However, this process is not
without restrictions. The compacting
pressures must not reach a point where
the whisker's strength would be dam-
aged, and the temperature must be held
below some critical value, for like rea-
sons.
The second possibility is the impreg-
nation of the cables and sheets with a
binder or matrix, analogous to today's
fiber glass methods where plastics such
as phenolics, silicones, and polyesters
are used to impart good cohesion to fila-
ment composites. The maximum temper-
ature at which these can now be used is
around 600 F. Researchers are, however,
working with fibers in a metal matrix,
and hoping for boron polymer resins to
be used at 1000 to 1200 F. in the near
future. It must be realized that in this
latter process, the modulus and strength
of the resulting material has been re-
duced by as much as twenty percent.
This reduction is a penalty for the
weight of the non-load-carrying binder.
Thus the enclosed fibers will carry most
of the tension load, while the matrix
will be very lightly stressed in shear.1
Thus the production of structural ma-
terials possessing great strength due to
the whisker constituent can be accom-
plished if the necessity arises.
George Hoffman provides an interest-
ing comparison of the cost of these new
materials in relation to that used in pres-
ent structures. He derives their potential
value from the weight reduction to one-
fifth that of materials now in use. One
current estimate of the cost of whisker
material is from $200 to $400 per in-
stalled pound, as compared to $40 per
installed pound of aluminum. But since
one pound of whisker composite might
replace five pounds of conventional ma-
terial, the actual cost has been prac-
tically equalized. Hoffman tells us, how-
ever, that the value of saving one pound
of structural weight in aircraft, for in-
stance, is anywhere from $100 to $1000,
and, of course, much higher where mis-
siles and astranautical vehicles are con-
cerned. Thus the value of the utilization
of one pound of whisker material cost-
ing $400 might well approach $4000.
Throughout the latter part of this ar-
ticle, the potential value of the exploi-
tation of whiskers and their composite
materials has been discussed and shown
to be entirely feasible. Research in this
field is comparatively new and there are
still many topics and questions to be stud-
ied and answered. The economic value
of whiskers dictates that further research
be conducted, even though the fruits of
it may still be ten to twenty years in the
future. When man has extracted the full
strength value from the perfect arrange-
ment of the atoms within crystals the
increase in strength that he will achieve
in structural materials could easily sur-
pass that achieved with the development
of steel from iron.

Houdini and others tried to converse
with the dead using telepathy. This rise
in public interest prompted two univer-
sities to undertake experiments: The
University of Groningen in Holland and
Harvard University. The Dutch experi-
ments, under the direction of Dr. H. G.
F. W. Brugmans, consisted of the iden-
tification of squares by a subject while
he was blindfolded. The experimenter
would think of a square and the sub-
ject was to point to the corresponding
square on a board which was placed in
front of him. Precaution was taken to
avoid physical contact between subject
and experimenter, yet out of 187 trials,
60 successes were obtained. On the basis
of chance, four correct would have been
expected. Unlike the Dutch experiments,
the Harvard tests, under the direction of
Prof. William McDougall and carried
out by Dr. G. H. Estabrooks, were con-
cerned with the identification of cards.
The experimenter would think of a card
and the subject would write down the
name of the card he thought it was.
Tabulation of the percentage of success-
es showed that the odds were one mil-
lion to one against the results being due
to chance.
These first experiments served but
one purpose: they built a strong case
for telepathy and opened the way for
extended investigations into telepathy
and other psi phenomena. Unfortunately
these experiments by the universities
were short-lived. Members of the psy-
chology profession frowned upon the
investigation of ESP and discouraged
any further investigation. In spite of
this discouragement, however, the facts
remained: ESP was possible and the
mind was not purely physical.
First Duke Experiments
1930 brought the establishment of
one of the most famous laboratories for
parapsychology. Today it is the lead-
ing laboratory for research in psi phe-
nomena. This institute is the Parapsy-
chology Laboratory of Duke University-.
Here, the majority of modern work has
been done in attempting to understand
psi phenomena. The first investigations
were under the direction of Professor
William McDougall. Previous experi-
ments had been haphazard with little
standardization so the first project was
to set up a system of standardized pro-
cedures which could be easily duplicated
by other investigators. One result of this
was a special pack of cards designed to
facilitate investigation of clairvoyance,
telepathy, and precognition. The pack

consisted of 25 cards, each having one
of five various geometric designs. These
designs, a star, circle, wavy lines, square,
and a cross, were selected because of
their distinctiveness. Two ways were used
to make up a pack: first was an equal
number of each card and was known as
an open pack, the other was a random
selection of the cards and an uneven dis-
tribution of each. If these cards were
used properly, the odds were 5 to 1
against selecting the correct card.
In previous tests, the experimenters
had failed to take into account the pos-
sibility of interference of various other
psi phenomena with the particular one
they were testing for. This was espec-
ially true with the telepathy experiments
because the experimenters looked at i
card and it was possible, through clair-
voyance, for the subject to directly per-
ceive the correct answer from the card
instead of from the experimenter. In
the new experiments for telepathy, the
sender was not given any object and
did not even write down the symbol he-
was thinking of until after a signal in-
dicated that the receiver had written
down his response. A similar precaution
against telepathy entering into clair-
voyance experiments was taken. In these
tests the cards were placed face down
by the experimenter so that no one knew
the order of the pack until after the
test. It was the duty of the subject to
write down the order. Using these pre-
cautions and the standard ESP deck,
experimenters again verified that the
existence of telepathy and clairvoyance
were very strong possibilities.
The Final Test
Up to this point experimenters had
merely proven that laws of chance were
being violated in the tests. Of course the
logical assumption was that something
such as ESP assisted in identifying the
cards. However, no conclusive test had
been performed which eliminated every-
thing but ESP as an explanation for the
results. After satisfactorily standardizing
procedure, the next step was to design
an experiment which would prove beyond
a doubt that psi phenomena did exist.
This experiment took the form of the
now famous Pearce-Pratt series carried
out at Duke in 1933.
As in previous tests, the receiver was
to identify cards, but this time there was
a change in the procedure. First, since
the object of the test was to prove the
existence of ESP, it was inconsequential
whether or not various psi phenomena
interfered with each other, so no pre-
caution was taken to eliminate the possi-
bility of such interference. Second, this
experiment was performed with the
sender and receiver separated by several
buildings and about 100 yeards. The
cards were handled by J. G. Pratt, at that
time a graduate student in psychology at
Duke. In another building, located about
one hundred yards away, was stationed


were made. The number of correct identi-
fications, based on chance would have
been 60, but Pearce successfully identi-
fied 119. Such results would not be
expected once in more than one trillion
trials! Other experimenters, notably Dr.
S. G. Soal of Queen Mary College in
London, carried out a similar series with
far more elaborate controls. The results
corresponded very closely to those ob-
tained by the Pearce-Pratt tests.
ESP vs Time
With the existence of ESP now on
firm ground, new questions began to rise.


Cards similar to these are used in tests to facilitate investigation of clairvoyance,
telepathy, and precognition.
Hubert Pearce, a Divinity School student.
Pearce's duty was to identify the cards
as Pratt visualized them one by one. The
two had synchronized their watches and
one minute was allowed for each card.
Pratt would pick a card and Pearce would
attempt to identify it. Two runs through
the pack were made each day for six
days. During each run, they would make
two records of the sender's activities and
two records of the receiver's responses.
Before they got together to compare
notes, one record of each was sealed in
an envelope and handed to an observer.
During the series, a total of 300 runs
What about precognition, could ESP
traverse the time barrier? The Pearce-
Pratt series, besides showing the existence
of ESP, showed that ESP was apparently
independent of space, therefore by the
relative association of time-space set
forth by physics, it seemed logical that
ESP could be independent of time. A
great many of the spontaneous cases of
ESP involved dreams and premonitions
of coming events which proved true.
Consider a very recent case, that of Dr.
Thornton the dentist whose hobby is
ESP. He recently made national headlines

Successful Firing of
Nike Zeus Accomplished
A completely successful firing of the
Army's Nike Zeus has been accomplished
by Douglas crews at White Sands Mis-
sile Range.
The Army said the Zeus is the only
anti-missile missile currently under devel-
opment in the free world. The launching
was another in the series of firings
planned to perfect the development of
the U.S. defense against a possible enemy
ICBM.
Objective was to evaluate the aerody-
namic characteristics of the anti-inter-
continental ballistic weapon. The launch,
boost, separation and sustainer opera-
tions all were successful, the Army said.
The Nike Zeus travelled an unguided
ballistic course. To accomplish this, the
guidance fins were locked in zero-degree
position. Both the booster and the sus-
tainer motor were fired successfully.
Developing about 450,000 pounds of
thrust, the booster is the largest single-
grain solid propellant motor ever fired.
The Army Rocket and Guided Missile
Agency, Huntsville, Ala., is the develop-
ing agency for the Nike Zeus. ARGMA
is an agency of the Army Ordnance mis-
sile command.
Nike Zeus, when developed, will be an
anti-missile missile intended to intercept
enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles
—ICBM's—before they can reach their
targets.
Prime contractor for the system is
Western Electric Company. System de-
velopment is the responsibility of Bell
Telephone Laboratories, and responsibil-
ity for the missile and missile handling
equipment is in the hands of Douglas
Aircraft.
The rocket motors were produced by
Grand Central Rocket Company and Thi-
okol Chemical Corporation.

The Viewports for the National Aero-

through the heat and shock re-entry.
The rectangular panels are being pro-
duced by Corning Glass Works for

signer and builder of the nation's first
man-carrying space vehicle. The view-
ports will enable the pilot to determine
the vehicle's attitude and to take astro-
nomical photographs. The glass panes
must withstand the same environmental
stresses as the capsule's triple-layered
metal walls.
The windows will include two outer
panels of a 96 per cent silica glass and
two inner panes of heat resistant alumi-
nosilicate glass. Air spaces between the
panes will retard heat transfer to the in-
side of the space capsule. The two in-
nermost panels will be tempered for
greater strength. The outer pane of glass
will be curved to the outside contour of
the capsule.
The glass must survive re-entry tem-
peratures and remain water-tight in an
ocean landing. The multi-layered con-
struction of the window provides a high
safety margin during re-entry and land-
ing.

"Solar hydrogen bombs"—a term for
a phenomenon on the sun—are not use-
ful for predicting communications—dis-
rupting solar flares, report astronomers
at The University of Michigan McMath-
Hulbert Observatory.
Professors Robert R. McMath, Orren
C. Mohler, and Helen W. Dodson made
observations of the "bombs" in the hope
that they could find a way to predict
solar flares.
Using new techniques, they found the
"bombs'* occur more generally than had
been believed. Hence they don't foretell
flares. The findings are described in the
February Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.
Solar flares are immense gaseous re-
gions, brighter than the surrounding sur-
face of the sun, which "boil up" sud-
denly. They are important to us because
they shoot out streams of charged par-
ticles and radiation which can disrupt
radio, telephone, and telegraph commu-
nications on earth for periods varying
from an hour to several days.
Being able to forecast them obviously
would be advantageous.
The solar bombs, which the U-M as-
tronomers hoped might foretell solar
flares, also are disturbances on the sun—
but, in contrast to flares, extremely small
and local brightenings. They can be de-
tected in the solar spectrum, or the
breaking down of sunlight into its dif-
ferent wave lengths or colors. ("Solar
hydrogen bomb" was the name given to
the phenomenon in 1917 by the astron-
omer Perdinand Ellerman.)
Somewhat as a rainbow breaks sun-
light down into the various colors, solar
spectral analysis provides a method to
precisely divided sunlight so that it can
show a single "color" line characteristic
only of solar bombs.
The McMath-HuIbert astronomers ob-
served occurrences of bombs—and of
solar flares—from 1955 through last
year, looking for a correlation between
the two.
While they found there is no way to
use the "bombs" to forecast the commu-
nications disrupting solar flares, they did
find that the bombs are associated with
sunspots. In contrast to solar flares, sun-
spots are large areas of relative cooling
of the sun's surface.
They found further that the bombs
originate in what had been described by
the French astronomer Bernard Lyot as
the solar phenomenon called "petit
points." The so-called bombs and the
"petit points" describe the same physi-
cal feature on the sun, the U-M astron-
omers assert.
The trio also report that detecting El-
lerman's solar hydrogen bombs by spec-
tral analysis is not as difficult as had
been believed. Formerly it was thought
that ideal viewing conditions were neces-
sary to detect the phenomena.
But special spectroscopic techniques
discovered by the authors provide high
contrast "pictures" of the bombs. Con-
trast is increased, they report, by using
a special filter (showing the K-line of
calcium).

This is concrete pipe, poured by a new
continuous process in a freshly-cut
ditch. Lengths of 50 to 300 feet with
diameters ranging from 12 to 48 inches
have been successfully made. Develop-
ment of a machine to lay 60-inch pipe
is under way.
Instant Concrete Pipe
Construction machinery that builds
"instant concrete pipe" in a freshly-cut
ditch at a rate of eight to twelve feet a
minute has been developed by Fuller-
form Continuous Pipe Corp.
Currently being used to build con-
duits for irrigation water on farms near
Phoenix, the new construction process is
being adapted to build storm sewers and
other types of concrete pipe.
Inflatable rubber and fabric forms,
designed by Goodyear Aircraft Corp. en-
gineers from blimp-type materials, are
part of the continuous-operation system.
Using two 300-foot inflated forms
with only three pounds per square inch
of air pressure, one can pour as much as
600 feet of concrete pipe at a time with-
out interruption.
Developed over the past nine years,
the construction process consists mainly
of a double-hoppered forming machine
that is pulled along the rounded bottom
of a ditch, while enveloping an inflated
inner form.
The inflatable "inner" form is picked
up by the "outer" form so tamping de-
vices can literally tuck concrete under it.
Half of the double hopper, activated by
electrically driven tampers, shoves con-
crete into the bottom of the ditch, while
the other half is forming the top of the
pipe.
The hose-like, inflatable form, con-
structed of two plies of cotton fabric
coated with neoprene rubber at Good-
year's aircraft plant near Phoenix, is open
at both ends to hold airtight bulkheads
through which air pressure is applied
for strength.
Machinery containing the "outside"
form for concrete pipe is set in the
ditch and one end of the inflatable form
is passed through it with bulkheads at
both ends. As concrete is poured into the
machine's double-hopper, the forming
machine is drawn forward by a cable on
a winch. An electric motor on top of the
machine operates the tamping devices
that distribute concrete uniformly and
tightly around the inner form.
About 20 different machines were
built before the right combination was
hit. Experimental tests by the dozens
were made on Fuller's Arizona ranch.
The tests were pure trial and error. Pipe
was laid, then broken out to check for
uniformity and strength.
Finally, Arizona Testing Laboratories
found the system and the finished prod-
ucts would meet Bureau of Reclamation
standards for Arizonia. The concrete
conduit, made with the first inflatable-de-
flatable pipe form, exceeded bureau
weight-test requirements by four tons
and compression strength by 520 pounds
per square inch.
Although the first commercial instal-
lations have been limited to irrigation
pipes, Mr. Fuller is convinced the new
pipe-building process is not confined to
this field.
He is currently working with the city
of Phoenix on plans to lay storm sew-
ers with his new system and perfecting
methods to go after the vast sanitary
sewer and other concrete pipe markets.

The word space commonly represents the outer, airless regions of the universe.
But there is quite another kind of "space" close at hand, a kind that will always
challenge the genius of man.
This space can easily be measured. It is the space-dimension of cities and the
distance between them ... the kind of space found between mainland and off-
shore oil rig, between a tiny, otherwise inaccessible clearing and its supply
base, between the site of a mountain crash and a waiting ambulance—above all,
Sikorsky is concerned with the precious "spaceway" that currently exists be-
tween all earthbound places.
Our engineering efforts are directed toward a variety of VTOL and STOL
aircraft configurations. Among earlier Sikorsky designs are some of the most
versatile airborne vehicles now in existence; on our boards today are the ve-
hicles that can prove to be tomorrow's most versatile means of transportation.
Here, then, is a space age challenge to be met with the finest and most practical
engineering talent. Here, perhaps, is the kind of challenge you can meet.

NEW ELECTRONIC "BRAIN" CELLS
FIT IN THE EYE OF A NEEDLE
Basic building block for compact,
electronic "thought savers" will
serve you in your office, in
defense-someday, in your home
• Today, science not only is working on labor-saving
devices—but on thought-saving devices as well.
These "thought savers" are electronic computers
—wonder-workers that free us from tedious mental
work and are capable of astoundingly rapid compu-
tations. Naturally, the more compact these computers
can be made, the more applications they can have.
Not only in industry, defense and research—but in
the office and ultimately in the home.
"Squeezing" exacting components
A big advance has recently been made by RCA
research towards making these "thought savers"
smaller than ever before, for broader than ever use.
Take, for example, the new "logic" circuit which
actually fits in the eye of a needle. It is a new
computer component developed by RCA.
Today, the electronic /unctions oj this micro-
miniature device require a whole fistful oj wires,
resistors, transistors and condensers.
These tiny units will calculate, sort, "remember,"
and will control the flow of information in to-
morrow's computers. Yet they are so small that
100,000,000 of them will fit into one cubic foot!
Cutting computers down to home size
This extreme reduction in size may mean that some-
day cigar-box-size electronic brains may help you in
your home—programming your automatic appli-
ances, and keeping track of household accounts.
Remarkable progress in micro-miniaturization is
another step forward by RCA— leader in radio, tele-
vision, in communications and in all^ electronics—Jor

after he correctly predicted many news
events including the World Series out-
come.
These spontaneous cases were not any
proof of the existence of precognition,
therefore the first step in the investiga-
tion of it was to prove its existence. This
was first attempted using the standard
deck and asking the subject to predict
the order of the cards after they were
shuffled. At first the deck was shuffled
by hand, then mechanically, then cut
according to a pattern determined by
temperature readings published in a spe-
cific newspaper on a particular date. It
was found that the subjects scored at
about the same rate as they did on the
cards during the telepathy and clair-
voyance tests. Indications were, after sev-
eral repetitions of the test, that this psi
phenomenon did exist; however, the
Duke experiments were the only ones
ever conducted on precognition and as
yet the case for precognition is not on
sound ground. Before precognition can
be positively identified, new and differ-
ent experiments must be designed; until
that time, it will remain only as a strong
possibility.
PK
After studying the results of many of
the experiments, the question arose
whether or not the mind could influence
the shuffling of the cards. For the first
time, the question of PK, or psychoki-
nesis, seriously entered the picture. The
answer to this question was also sought in
experimentation. The idea for this test
was suggested by a gambler who con-

tended that the throw of the dice could
be influenced by direct action of will.
The test which was developed was de-
signed to see if the subject could control
the throw of dice. Mechanical methods
were devised to handle the dice so as to
eliminate the possibility of manipulation
by hand. The results of these first ex-
periments seemed to indicate that PK
was a factor.
After eight years of investigation by
many different experimenters, a report
was finally published by Duke Labora-
tories. The conclusion of this report was
based on an analysis of a large body of
experimental records which had been
gathered during the eight year period.
For each of these different experiments
different subjects were used, different
dice, and variations in the means of
handling the dice. The one thing in
common with each investigation was that
the subject attempted to control the fall
of the dice. Upon examination of the
data sheets it was observed that the per-
centage of successes of each page de-
clined as one went from the left to the
right and from the top to the bottom. To
compare the percentages, each page was
divided into quarters. It was observed
that the upper left corner had the high-
est percentages, while the lower right had
the lowest percentages. It was only ne-
cessary, therefore, to evaluate the total
difference in the percentage of these two
quarters for each sheet of each series, and
then to compare this percentage to the
one which would be expected by chance.
Final evaluation showed the results to
be one million to one against occuring
by chance!
This test appeared to be the crucial
one; the results seemed to be indisput-
able. To eliminate the possibility of error
in misinterpreting the data, another psy-
chologist, associated with Duke but not
with the experiment, re-evaluated the
data, and with the exception of two mi-
nor errors found it to be correct. The
conclusion drawn by the Duke Lab in
favor of PK has been verified in other
experiments with added refinements in
technique. In each case, the data seemed
to justify the fact that PK was a factor
in controlling the fall of the dice.

the new gas turbine car of tomorrow
It will be power-packed: the gas turbine
engine in your dream car of the future
and tomorrow's trucks and buses.
Only one spark plug-
runs on kerosene
This new engine is much lighter, smaller.
It has far fewer parts. No pistons. No water
system. Only one spark plug. Runs on
lower-grade fuels.
Not yet in production!
Before the car is a showroom reality, engi-
neers fare a number of problems.
One problem—the one Inco is helping with
- is metals. Strong and economical metals
to resist heat and corrosion.
Cas turbines operate at up to 1600°F. These
temperatures step up corrosion of metals,
promote troublesome distortions. So the
job is to develop practical alloys able to
carry the load—alloys that can, at the same
time, offset the corrosives, resist the distort-
ing forces found at jet-high temperatures.
How far has Inco research gone
in its search for practical alloys?
Difficult as they are, the problems of metal
performance at high temperature are a
familiar story at Inco. Inco research has
dealt with them for years. And come up
with solutions in the gas turbine and in
many other fields. In conventional, atomic,
and thermionic power. In petrochemistry.
In heat treating. In jet aviation. In mis-
silry. Even in Hollywood's 8000°F carbon-
arc "suns."

mation .. . over 300,000 indexed and cross-

tivities. Telepathy, clairvoyance, precog-
nition, and PK can no longer be dis-
carded as mere figments of the imagina-
tion. ESP and PK are apparently inde-
pendent of space, time, and matter, but
it is lawful and orderly in its operation
and affects each and every man, woman
and child.
Of course anything so radical and revo-
lutionary is slow to gain acceptance. But
people should not be so willing to dis-
card new ideas. Why is it not possible
for there to be new forces besides those
that are known? The practical applica-
tions of such forces are unlimited. They
range from predicting future events, find-
ing lost objects, communication, location
of underground deposits of minerals, to
obtaining military secrets of potential
enemies. Before such application can oc-
cur, however, the science of ESP must be
understood. The next step by parapsy-
chologists is an attempt to find out what
ESP and PK are and how they work. It
will be a long time before the infant
science grows up, but when it does man
will have answered one of the fundamen-
tal questions concerning himself: what is
his mind?

Asphalt pavements
If you're going into Civil Engineering, it will pay
you to keep a close eye on Asphalt design devel-
opments.
Here, for example, is the latest from Oklahoma
... one of the new, DEEP-STRENGTH Asphalt
pavements the state is using on Interstate 40.
This one is outstanding because its base is 8 inches
of hot-mixed—hot-laid sand-Asphalt ... no coarse
aggregate.
Why 8 inches? Why not 6 or 10? What did engi-
neers do to insure good drainage? What factors
set the design?
The Asphalt Institute answers questions like
these . . . keeps you abreast of all the latest in the
design of Asphalt Highways, the most durable
and economical pavements known. Would you

in water softening is a common process
familiar to most people. Hard water
containing magnesium, calcium, iron,
etc., is run through a bed of zeolite. The
resin gives off soft sodium ions as it
absorbs the hard ones. The conditions for
the zeolite to absorb the hard ions are
met by the raw water itself, and for-
tunately the zeolite may be regenerated
simply by passing a salt solution through
the bed. The excess concentration of
sodium is enough to force out the hard
ions.
Zeolite in the home is usually found
in replaceable tanks serviced by a water
softening company. When the tank is
exhausted, it is returned to the factory
for regeneration while a fresh tank is
put in its place. Also, synthetic resins
may be seen in the home in the form of
cartridges used to soften small amounts
of water for use in steam irons. These
can be regenerated in the home without
much trouble.
Not so well known is the use of ion
exchange resins to treat already softened
(Continued from page 19)
water to remove the last traces of im-
purities from water such as used in the
coating of television rubes, high press-
ure boilers and pharmaceutical products.
Both a cation and an anion column are
used in tandem. This procedure removes
the ions from the water and replaces
them with pure water. The use of a
zeolite would leave sodium ions in the
water. The two reactions below show
such an exchange process. Although cal-
cium has been chosen for the example,
the other ions are of similar reactions.
Ca'ions + H'resin =H*acid + Ca**resin
H'acid + OH-risin = H20-(- acid resin
Purity of several parts per billion of im-
purity can be obtained under special cir-
cumstances. Water at a continuous level
of several parts per million is now ob-
tained regularly in most elevated temper-
ature and pressure steam boiler systems,
where even a minute amount of impurity
could foul the tubes by forming scale.
Such a process would work very well
for the desalting of seawater but for the
fact that the ion exchange columns are
too expensive to run when the impurities
of the feed water are over 1000 parts
per million, a concentration extremely
less than that of sea water. A different
approach to ion exchange of seawater is
being studied, and shows much promise.
Ocean Wafer Survival Kits
Although ion exchange for sea water
conversion is at present completely un-
economical on a large scale, ion exchange
resin briquettes were developed during
the war for ocean survival. When such
a briquette was dropped in a container
holding ten times its volume of sea
water, it disintegrated and exchanged
the salts of the water, forming an insolu-
able precipitate easily removed. The
briquettes were fairly expensive and could
only be used once, but the important
consideration was furnishing fresh water
with little emphasis on the price.

of uranium from very low grade ores,
a process extremely costly by other means.
Uranium ore is put into solution, giving
a large volume of solution with a small
amount of uranium. The concentration
of the uranium may be as low as .1 per-
cent. In addition, the solution is rich
in impurities such as titanium and alum-
inum.
For this particular use an anion ex-
change resin is employed, since the
uranium can be put in an anion com-
plex form. A sample recovery operation
is described below.
A. The ore is leached with sulfuric
acid to put it into solution.
B. The solution is passed through a
resin column, chosen to absorb the uran-
ium only, until the first trace of uranium
appears at the outlet.
C. The column is washed with water
to remove the extraneous solution from
the column.
D. The uranium is eluted out of the
column with an appropriate salt solu-
tion.
E. The uranium, now in a concen-
trated state, is precipitated out and re-
covered.
Sometimes the ore is difficult to put in
a clear solution and filtering is too diffi-
cult to be practical. In such cases, the
resin is placed in porous baskets which
oscillate through the pulpy solution.
When the resin is saturated, the pulpy
solution is simply washed out with water
and the uranium eluted as before.
Gold Recovery
The ion exchange mechanism for re-
covering gold and silver is slightly differ-
ent from that of uranium, in that all im-
purities as well as gold are absorbed by
the resin. The impurities are then eluted
out, leaving the noble metals on the resin.
The following flow sheet shows the
process.
Since the concentration of the desired
metals are so slight, the gold and silver
from the first cycle are left in place and
another cycle repeated. This procedure
stockpiles the two on the resin. When
the concentration reaches about 9 percent
by weight of the resin they are eluted out
and recovered by precipitation.

urating the upper part of a resin column

perties and attraction to the resin. The
eluting solution is chosen to have an
attraction to the resin slightly greater
than the most tightly held of the ab-
sorbed ions. During elution the ion with
the least attraction is forced out of the
resin first, the other ions are successively
forced out in order of increasing attrac-
tion to the resin. This permits nearly one
hundred percent separation when the
column is of the proper length. The fol-
lowing graph is an example of a chro-
matographic separation of radioactive

Fafnir Ball Bearings help turbojets
set new performance records
A recent article in a leading newspaper quoted
airline executives to the effect that Pratt and
Whitney Aircraft jet engines are proving to be
the most reliable ever put into commercial
planes.
In designing these jet engines, Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft looked to The Fafnir Bearing
Company as a major source for main rotor
thrust bearings, generally regarded as among
the critical engine components, and one of the
most exacting to produce. Each ball bearing is
custom-built and rigorously tested. Tolerances
are held to the millionths-of-an-inch.
P&amp;WA turned to Fafnir because of Fafnir's
long experience in the design and development
of aircraft bearings. Fafnir established an air-
craft division thirty years ago, the first in the
industry, and through it, is keeping pace with
the revolutionary changes in aircraft design.
To help solve this and other ball bearing
problems, Fafnir maintains the most up-to-date
facilities for metallurgical research, and bear-
ing development and testing. Fafnir may be
able to help you some day. Worth bearing in

^HD DISBROW exemplifies the opportunity to grow with a young,
growing company. Now District Manager of the Dunham-Bush Minne-
apolis office, he supervises widespread engineering activities of a group
of sales engineers representing a multi-product technical line.
Engineering degree in hand, Ed went to work for Heat-X (a Dunham-
Bush subsidiary) as an Application Engineer. Successive steps in the
Dunham-Bush main office and as Sales Engineer in the New York
territory brought him to his present managerial capacity.
A member of Belle Aire Yacht Club, Ed leads a pleasant life afloat
and ashore with his wife and two boys.
Equally satisfying is Ed's job. In directing calls on consulting engi-
neers, architects, plant engineers, wholesalers, contractors and building
owners, he knows he's backed by the extensive facilities of Dunham-
Bush laboratories. You can see him pictured above on a typical call
inspecting a Minnesota shopping center Dunham-Bush air conditioning
installation.
Ed's success pattern is enhanced by the wide range of products he
represents. For Dunham-Bush refrigeration products run from com-
pressors to complete systems; the range of air conditioning products
extends from motel room conditioners to a hospital's entire air condi-
tioning plant. The heating line is equally complete: from a radiator
valve to zone heating control for an entire apartment housing project.
The Dunham-Bush product family even includes highly specialized heat
transfer products applicable to missile use.

ions may be very similar, a slow rate of
elution will greatly emphasize the differ-
ences and permit clean separations. Rare
earths and amino acids, because of their
similarity, are ideally suited to such i
process. As many as several hundred
precipitations and crystallizations were
needed to separate some of the rare
earths by other means.
Recovery of Photographic Silver
Each year the photographic industry
discards many thousands of dollars worth
of silver in solution because the very
low concentration makes recovery un-
economical. Ion exchange is being tried
out as a practical means of treating the
large volumes of solution to recover the
silver at a relatively low cost. Such a
process is expected to pay for itself in a
few short years.
Separation of Streptomycin
Before 1948 the cost of streptomycin
was very high. Separation from the cul-
ture broth could be accomplished only
after long and expensive chemical steps.
In 1948 the pharmaceutical industry tried
ion exchange. The results were success-
ful and the price correspondingly
dropped. Since that time the pharmaceu-
tical industry has been one of the major
advocates of ion exchange, using it in
many processes and separations.
Medical Applications
One of the most interesting applica-
tions of ion exchange is in the field of
internal medicine. Resins taken orally
are able to absorb excess stomach acids
without the usual side effects of anta-
cids, can remove excess pepsin from the
stomach thereby lessening irritation of
stomach ulcers, and can lower the body
supply of sodium or potassium. Also,
ion exchange resins have enabled arti-
ficial kidneys to become so efficient in
removing substances from the blood that
they may be used in place of a human
kidney for short periods of time. Many
new kidney operations are now possible.
Continuous Operations

tion of the resin column was batch, or
intermittant. The solution to be ex-
changed was shut off during the wash-

SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITY
(Continued from page 21)

Figures and drauing courtesy of Facit, Inc.
Statisticians have removed some of the guesswork from life expectancy figures.
The average man of 20 is odds-on to live 54 more years, while at 30 he can ex-
pect another 44 years. When he reaches 40 he can expect 35 more years, and
at 50 he can expect to live past 75.
How does this help me? The answer is
based on the theory that it is better to
consider what you are doing beforehand
than afterwards.
The process is this: First, consider all
the alternatives before you. It might be
simply yes or no as in the case of whether
or not to make the bet, or it might be
a multiple choice as in deciding where
to spend summer vacation. In any case,
try to examine all of the alternatives;
don't forget the possibility of doing
nothing, it could turn out to be the best
choice.
Next, consider the possible results of
each choice and their probability of
occurence to the best of your knowledge.
Not just perhaps it will rain or perhaps
it won't, rather there is a 30 percent
chance that it will rain, a twenty per-
cent chance that it will be cloudy and a
fifty percent chance that it will be clear.
You may wish to get more information,
but don't spend more time than it's
worth—a bad guess isn't generally fatal.
Third, evaluate your pleasure or dis-
pleasure with each result in pleasure-
regret units as closely as practicable and
multiply by the probability of it's occur-
ence.
Finally, add each set of results for
each choice. Generally one choice will
outshine all others; if, however, the
values are close to one another, you
might check to see if you did, in fact,
include all the alternatives.
For instance take the decision of
whether or not to cross the street, a rela-
tively simple decision.
Choice A: Do not cross:
Result Probability Pleasure
Get run down. None —10,000
Get to class. None + 3
Choice B: Cross here in the
middle of
the block:
Result Probability
Pleasure
Get run down. 1/100,000
—10,000
Get a J-walking
ticket 1/100
-10
Get to class. 99/100
-3
Choice C: Cross at the corner
Result Probability
Pleasure
Get run down. 1/500,000
—10,000
Get to class. 499,999/500
000 +3
The tally: A—0
B—2.8
C—2.98
Thus, we dicide to cross at the corner.
The beauty of this type of decision is
that it takes into account all the informa-
tion you have, how you would feel in
each instance, and your confidence, (not
a small factor.)

tinuous processes have been developed
to attempt to overcome the short time
lag between cycles.
The first of these incorporates the
resin in small packets woven into a belt.
The belt moves alternatively through the
solutions continuously. Similarly, a fab-
ric belt with interwoven resin particles
has been developed which is run con-
tinuously through the proper solutions.
Another process entails pumping the
resin up through one column and allow-
ing it to cascade down through a second
one. A resin of sufficient settling density
must be used.
One other process involves baskets of
resin equally spaced around the rim of
a wheel. The solutions are run in at the
top and out the bottom in a continuous
flow as the wheel slowly turns. The so-
lutions are kept separate by rubber dams
around the outside of the baskets.
Future of Ion Exchange
Although a comparatively new pro-
cess, ion exchange has opened the door
to many processes previously impractical
and has simplified many others. But the
field is by no means depleted of appli-
cations. A great breakthrough in the
purification of seawater is expected with
the use of ion exchange membranes, and
resins are being designed for more selec-
tive properties in the separation of
rare earths and radioactive elements. The
future may see a resin able to exchange
one element only, available for every
element! Much research is needed in de-
signing optimum resin columns. Yes,
the future looks promising for ion ex-
change, greatly increasing the chemical
industries' contribution to everyday life.

is the theme of this month's cover. Jim
Berson. our cover artist, has tried to de-
pict the beginning of life starting with
the energy of the sun and the basic
chemical building blocks of hydrogen,
ni-rogen, oxygen, and carbon symbolized
by the red, large blue, small blue, and
black mo'ecules seen on the cover. Sim-
ple molecules formed first and evolved,
fiinally reaching the state of a one-
celled animal. The process doesn't stop
here of course, but our cover space
does; a more complete explanation can
be obtained by reading the cover ar-
ticle, "Chance of a Lifetime."

APATHY: Don't
In the past month a great deal has been written in campus and
college publications about the apathetic student and his lack of
realization of the value of extra-curricular activities Nearly all of
these articles have harrangued the student for not running for, work-
ing with, or attending meetings of all or some of the more than 100
student organizations. The point was that students are apathetic and
don't realize the immense value of activities to the individual.
In our opinion, this is a false conclusion. Students are not
apathetic. College students are intelligent enough to realize, and
do realize, the value participation in activities can play in pre-
paring a person for life.
Upon hearng a statement such as this people who support the
student apathy viewpoint will be glad to cite statistcs to support
their position. For instance:
—The steady decline in the number of people voting in
the S.G.C. elections, culminating with a new low in
March.
—The lack of candidates and voters in the Senior class
elections (Engineering included).
—And on the engineering scene, the lack of interest the
Engineering Council and its projects (i.e.—Engineer's
Weekend); the spasmodic attendance at technical and
honorary society meetings.
From these and other statements comes the conclusion that students
are apathetic.
Once again we say this is a false conclusion. Admittedly, there
is a lack of interest in activities on the part of students. It is our
firm conviction, however, that the lack of interest is caused, not by
the students, but by the organizations themselves. Too many organi-
zations drift along with no real reason for existence, others spend
so much time trying to find something to do that they have no time
to accomplish anything, still others carry out some busy work job
that the administration has allowed them to do.
How then does this thesis apply to the College of Engineering
and the so-called engineering activities? First of all, it is generally
felt that a majority of engineering groups get little support from
the student body. A great deal of this lack of support stems direct-
ly from the fact that the organizations have little or no purpose for
existing. An example are the class boards (with one exception—
See Ink Spots) who spent so much time trying to decide what to
do that they ended up doing very little. This fact was reflected so
strongly by students failing to run or to vote in the elections that
two classes don't even have boards now.
The Engineering Council is another group that seems to have
great potential but has consistently failed to win the support of the
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Blame the Students
student body, and all too frequently, of its own members. Why has
this group, which has accomplished such concrete projects as the
Lounge and the Dean Brown Memorial Plaque, held in such low
esteem by the students? To find the answer to this question, and
thus the solution, the Council should determine for what purpose
it exists. Only when this purpose is justified in light of student's
needs and desires will the support, that has been lacking in the past,
be forthcoming in the future.
This leads us to an overall answer of how the thesis applies to
the College of Engineering. Just as with the Engineering Council,
the other organizations in the College—technical societies, honor-
aries, governing bodies, and publications—must justify their exist-
ence by the value of the functions that they fulfill. More basically
they must decide if they do fulfill any purpose, and if so, if this
purpose is contributing to the benefit of the students, the College,
or the profession.
It is hoped that the new officers of the engineering groups, most
of whom will be taking office in the near future, will face this
question in regard to their own organization. If the answers are
unsatisfactory it is time to reevaluate the reasons for the organiza-
tion's existence.
In any event, only when the answers are compatible with the
world of today can we expect "student apathy" to disappear.
3nk Spoti
Although class boards were singled out in the editorial as a
group that has been of little or no value, we are happy to say that
one exception does exist—the Executive Board of the Class of '6IE.
Earlier this year the Board compiled, distributed, and evaluated a
freshman questionnaire, making the results available to the Col-
lege's Freshman Counseling Committee.
More recently the Board sponsored the first of a projected
series of plant visits for undergraduates. The aim in the future is to
make it possible for undergrads to visit two or three plants in their
field of specialization.
To us this seems so beneficial and desirable that we would like
to see it be a required part of the sophomore or junior year. As it
is now many students never get into a plant until they are seniors
on plant interview visits. By this time the experience is too late
to be of any help in course work.

PLUTO
Recent developments have led many scientists
to believe that the discovery of Pluto was a
fantastic coincidence.
By CHARLES MASSER

This photograph is the one from
which the discovery of Pluto was
made. Pluto's image is shown be-
tween the two small dash marks
near the center of the picture.
As one entered the darkened room,
all that could be seen was a fig-
ure illuminated by an eerie light, which
blinked on and off. That light, caused
by a "blink microscope," was to find a
special 15th magnitude object located
somewhere in 170 square degrees of
sky. This was the final operation in.
searching for a new planet that had
been theoretically found by the use of
celestial mechanics.
The Discovery
In the first operation, photographs
were taken, each one covering a small
portion of the area in question. Then six
days later another-photograph was taken
of each area. If that special object was
in the area the movement of the Earth
would cause it to move from one posi-
tion in the first plate to a new position
in the second plate. In using the "blink
microscope" the two plates are precisely
aligned so that light can be beamed by
means of a mirror alternately to each
plate. The observer can pick out an ob-
ject in the first plate, flick the mirror and
observe the same object in the second
plate. If there has been a movement of
the object it would appear to jump to a
new position. And so the work contin-
ued, week after week,, month after
month; then after more than a year Clyde
Tombaugh was rewarded. He had lo-
cated an object far beyond the eighth
Planet Neptune, which had the charac-
teristic movements of a new planet. And
so on March 13, 1930, the discovery of
a new planet was announced to the
world. Many names were suggested for
the new planet, but the three most pop-
ular were Coroners, PJuto, and Minerva.
However, Pluto was better known be-
cause his two brothers Jupiter and Sat-
urn already had planets named after
them. So early in May the name Pluto
was given to the new planet. It revolves
about the sun at a mean distance of
3,675,000,000 miles. At aphelion Pluto
is 4,589,000,000 miles from the Sun,
while at perihelion it is only 2,761,000,-
000 miles from the Sun. This gives an
eccentricity value of 0.249, largest of all
the planets. Pluto wanders so much that
at perihelion it is 16,000,000 miles closer
to the Sun than Neptune ever comes, but
due to its eccentricity its closest approach
to Neptune is 240 million miles.
High Point for Celestial Mechanics
With the discovery of Pluto classical
celestial mechanics had reached its maxi-
mum glory. With the help of celestial
mechanics perturbations in the orbits of
Uranus and Neptune led to the mathe-
matical prediction of a new planet. In
fact, there calculations showed where to
look for the new planet. Astronomers

looked and found it, thereby fulfilling
the predictions that celestial mechanics
made. But as the years pass and more in-
formation is compiled on Pluto, doubt
enters the mind of leading astronomers
of the accuracy and effectiveness of celes-
tial mechanics at such great distances.
Many astronomers declare that the dis-
covery of Pluto was an accident and
back up their theory with convincing
data. In fact, many scientists believe
Pluto is not even a planet, but that it
is an escaped satellite of Neptune. Who
is right; what are the correct answers?
One can only present the facts now, but
the future may bring the answers.
First Triumph for Celestial Mechanics
It was Urbain Jean Joseph Leverrie
who studied the small irregularities in
the orbit of Uranus, and from his com-
putations pinpointed the position of Nep-
tune within a degree of where it was
found in the constellation Aquarius.
With the discovery of Neptune in Sep-
tember, 1846 hopes heightened that a new
planet beyond Neptune could be found
by using the same process. Even though
Uranus had been observed for two com-
plete revolutions around the Sun, time
had to pass in order to observe the
planet Neptune for irregularities in its
orbit. By 1900 celestial mechanicians
had acquired their data and a fresh at-
tack was launched in the search for the
ninth planet. W. H. Pickering of the
Harvard College Observatory, while work-
ing on his data and data of other ob-
servers, predicted a trans-Neptunian
planet near the foot of the constellation
Gemini in 1919. However, the planet
was not found when photographs taken
of the area were examined. At the same
time Pickering was working on his cal-
culations, Percival Lowell of the Lowell
Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz, was hard
at work on a new approach for pinpoint-
ing the ninth planet. Since the ninth
planet, if there was one, would be beyond
Neptune, it would disturb Neptune more
than it would disturb Uranus. Therefore
Lowell based his findings more on the
irregularities in Neptune's orbit. Using
this approach Lowell found two areas in
which the new planet should be located.
One of these areas was the same as pre-
scribed by Pickering in 1919. Then the
process of taking the photographs was
undertaken. Two pictures of each area
taken several days apart were obtained,
but the sensitivity of the film used proved
inadquate, for no planet was uncovered
in the search. Not until 1929 did Lowell
Observatory receive cameras of necessary
quality. The search was again taken up,
but this time by a young assistant named
Clyde Tombaugh. It was through him,
and his long hours of work, examining
over two million photographs ,that the
ninth planet was found.
Reinvestgation of Pickerinng
and Lowell's Work
Since the proper equipment was not
available until 1929, a reinvestigation
was conducted of Lowell's photographs
made from 1914 to 1916, and the Mount
Wilson plates made in 1919 by Picker-
ing. The new planet had been over-
looked because it appeared unexpectedly
faint, in fact it was 1,000 times fainter
than Neptune. The faintness of Pluto
was very strange, and astronomers were
at a loss for an answer. If Pluto were
so faint it would follow that Pluto would
be small in diameter. And if it was small
in diameter it would not likely be very
massive. But if this is all true, the dis-
turbances in the orbits of Uranus and
Neptune could not have been caused by
Pluto. On the other hand, if Pluto were
small and its mass high, its density would
be unreasonably high. Still another an-
swer is that Pluto is large in diameter
but its albedo reflectivity is unexpect-
edly low. The question now is which
answer is correct.
Determination of Pluto's Mass
The first thing was to determine the
mass of Pluto. In the case of the planets
Uranus and Neptune their satellites ac-
curately revealed their masses. With
Pluto, however, this was impossible be-
cause it apparently had no satellites. The
mass of Pluto was then measured by the
displacement of Uranus and Neptune
from their orbits. The displacement of
six seconds of arc in Neptune's celestial
longitude could be caused by Pluto if
its mass were about equal to that of the
Earth. The mass of Pluto would be small
compared to Uranus and Neptune, which
have masses of 14.5 and 17.2 Earth
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


mass led to the announcement by sever-
al astronomers that the discovery of Pluto
was an accident. But then why did Low-
ell and Pickering pick the same region
in the sky to look for the new planet?
An explanation of this came from Vladi-
mir Kourganoff. He found that both
Lowell and Pickering relied on a group
of observations in 1710 on Uranus be-
fore it was declared a planet. Unfortu-
nately these observations were crude and
much error was involved in the observed
displacement of Uranus's orbit. Recent
observations and use of computers, which
used the calculated positions of the
outer planets from 1653 to 2060, have
calculated the displacements in the orbits
of Urnus and Neptune and have given
Pluto a mass slightly less than that of
the Earth.
New Observavtions Bring a Change
Everyone seemed happy with the re-
sults until a set of observations made in
March 1950 by Gerard P. Kuiper were
published. At the Mount Palomar Ob-
savertory he used the 200 inch telescope
as a visual experiment. He was compar-
ing the si2e of Pluto's image with a stand-
ard set of disks. With the help of Mil-
ton Humason they agreed that Pluto had
an apparent diameter of 0.23 seconds of
arc. This corresponds to 3,600 miles or
about half the diameter of the Earth. If
Pluto's mass were about equal to that of
the Earth, the calculation using 3,600
miles as Pluto's diameter would cause it
to have a density five times that of lead.
This is highly unlikely. A point was then
made about the accuracy of Pluto's di-
ameter, which was determined by the
disk method. Dinsmore Alter of Grif-
fith Observatory, Los Angeles, stated that
if Pluto reflected light like a polished
ball, the observed diameter would only be
a portion of the true diameter. However,
this was thrown out because Pluto's sur-
face has surely undergone changes such
as erosion, evaporation, and bombard-
ment by cosmic material. Which theory
is right? Celestial mechanics states that
Pluto's mass is about equal that of the
Earth. The other theory given by Kui-
per, which is reinforced by visual data,
states the diameter of Pluto is 3,600
miles. The answer that was chosen was
Kuiper's because his measurements could
not be argued, whereas the determina-
tion of Pluto's mass by methods of celes-
tial mechanics was too weak. Using 3,600
as the value for Pluto's diameter, the
mass is calculated to be about 0.03 that
of the Earth. Such a small mass as this
could not have produced the perturba-
tions in Uranus in 1710 the Lowell and
Pickering so heavily relied on.
Escaped Satellite of Neptune
Now astronomers attacked the state-
ment that Pluto was a planet. This led
to many questions and new theories about
the origin of Pluto and of the universe.
The large eccentricity of Pluto's orbit,
and the fact that its orbit has an inclina-
tion of over 17 degrees to the plane of
the ecliptic, led Issei Yamomoto of the
Kyoto Observatory to speculate in 1933
that Pluto was originally a satellite of
Neptune. A little later, calculations by
R. A. Lyteleton of the University of
Cambridge showed that Pluto had a
close encounter with Triton, the largest
satellite of Neptune. This encounter
might have ejected Pluto from the gravi-
tational system of Neptune. The two
present known satellites of Neptune had
been recaptured. Triton's orbit is retro-
grading (The movement in its orbit is
opposite to that of the movement of
Neptune around the Sun.) and Nereid's
orbit is highly eccentric. Just recently
more proof has been obtained to sub-
stantiate the theory that Pluto was a sat-
ellite of Neptune. In 1956, Merle Walk-
er and Robert Hardie measured the
changes in light reflection by Pluto. The
small fluctuations in brightness occurred
in cycles of 6.39 days. This would indi-
cate that Pluto rotates in a period of 6.39
days. This value is much slower than the
other outer planets, which rotate once
in 10 to 15 hours. Kuiper stated that
Pluto could have been revolving around
Neptune in a period of 6.39 days, and
when it escaped from Neptune it kept
rotating with the same value.
Celestial Mechanics Useless
Since Lowell and Pickering could not
have theoretically located Pluto by celes-
tial mechanics the laws of celestial me-
chanics have become useless in searching
for other unknown bodies that lie be-
yond Neptune. In the future we must
turn to astrophotography and hope for
another fantastic, accidental discovery
using this method. A systematic search
covering three quarters of the sky on
each side of the ecliptic has been made
since the discovery of Pluto. Over 90
million star images have been examined
by Tombough, and although no trans-
Plutonian planet has been found nearly
9,000 asteroids have been plotted. Other
by-products of the search were 1,807
variable stars, and 29,548 galaxies, but
only one comet was discovered by the
search.
The escape of Pluto from Neptune,
however, raises the hopes that more ob-
jects, larger and more interesting than
Pluto will be found on the fringes of
our solar system. Several other Neptunian
satellites could have escaped and are
traveling at even higher elliptical orbits
than Pluto. If photography can uncover
some of these wandering bodies more
questions will be answered concerning
the origin of our solar system.

The nature of physical things is much more
easily conceived when they are beheld coming
gradually into existence, than when they are
only considered as produced at once in a fin-
ished and perfect state.

The blackness of night and the
brightness of day are joined by a
transient bridge called dawn. In a simi-
lar way, our world is divided into living
and nonliving parts, joined by a gray
area of life. Quantities on this life scale
such as living man at one extreme and
inert stone near the other, are well de-
fined. But inhabitants of the intervening
gray are as elusive as their dwelling place.
For example, a tobacco blight, known as
mosaic disease, is caused by a virus which
infects the plants, grows within them and
propagates throughout the crop like a
living pathogenic organism. Yet, in the
laboratory, this same living virus was
recently (1955) split into nonliving
parts, one consisting of a protein mole-
cule and the other of nucleic acids. These
parts were then recombined to form the
original active, infectious virus. The in-
determinate character of such substances
lends credence to the concept of a life-
'nonlife continuum and also points up
!,the difficulty of coining a rigorous defini-
Ition of life.
For that reason, let us confine our-
selves momentarily to a brief investiga-
tion of those things, which we intuitively
Consider alive, at the more extreme end
Of the scale. Here the term "living" can
be readily applied to organisms which
are able to grow, reproduce and be self-
sustained by a dynamic process involv-
ing the continuous influx and outflow
of matter and energy. Although they are
clearly defined by their living character-
istics, the true nature of these life forms
is still obscured by their complicated ar-
chitecture. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and
hydrogen are the chemical common de-
nominators of an enormous family of
substances known as organic compounds.
These compounds, in turn constitute the
brick and mortar of which living things
are made. In order to appreciate the
complexity of even the simplest living
structures, consider just one of the or-
ganic building blocks which they con-
tain. For example, a class of substances
called proteins is found in every living
cell. B-lactoglobulin, which is one of the
most elementary proteins, contains: 1,868
atoms of carbon, 3,010 atoms of hydro-
gen, 468 atoms of nitrogen, 583 atoms
of oxygen plus some thirty-odd atoms of
sulphur—all combined in a unique ar-
rangement. Complex as these proteins
are alone, it must be emphasized that in
a biological organism they are but one
small part of the living whole. Numerous
other compounds such as carbohydrates,

Obscure Origins
The origin of life has puzzled man for
ages. Until the middle of the 19th cen-
tury, there were two beliefs in vogue.
One traced life's beginning to an original
supernatural creative act; the other found
its expression in the theory of spontane-
ous creation. The latter was a product of
simple observations. For example, mag-
gots seemed to appear from nowhere on
exposed meat. Likewise, mice arose out
of garbage and refuse. The conclusion
drawn from these observations was that
the maggots and mice were spontaneous-
ly generated out of the nonliving sub-
stances of their surroundings. The idea
might be humorously summed up by the
old nursery rhyme, "Sugar and spice and
everything nice, that's what little girls
are made of." In spite of its long stand-
ing, the crude spontaneous theory faded
in the wake of careful observations. It
was discovered that covering fresh meat
with a net or screen, so that flies couldn't
by eggs on it, ended the appearance of
maggots. Similarly, sealed garbage con-
tainers ended the creation of mice. It
remained for Louis Pasteur, however,
to settle the matter decisively. He demon-
strated, in his laboratory, that even the
process of decay could be prevented, that
perishables could be preserved indefinite-
ly when protected from external con-
tamination. In short, he shattered any
beliefs that the nonliving could give rise
to the living. At about the same time, old
ideas and attitudes were further jarred
by the publication of Darwin's The Ori-
gin of Species. Aside from its loudly crit-
icized monkey-man implications, the evo-
lutionary theory carried with it a less
obvious but nonetheless important con-
cept. Its underlying thread was to evoke
in man a new awareness of the impor-
tance of time. Suddenly the effect of
millions and billions of years, upon the
world and life, became highly significant.
The period immediately following was
one in which scientific inquiry into the
origin of life essentially ceased. Pasteur
had left no paths to follow. The concept
of a primary supernatural act, though
possibly sound, was by its very nature
impossible to investigate scientifically.
Disregarding the issue entirely, science
surged ahead throughout the remainder
of the 19th and into the 20th century,

Few people realize the present and future
importance of graphite in modern industry.
By PAT SOROKIN
Have you any idea how many times
you daily come in contact with
products made of or processed by graph-
ite? Few people know that there are
well over a thousand such products.
Dishes, adding machines, lamps, cars,
concrete, pencils, glass, batteries, and
rubber are just a few of the countless
number of products which are processed
with or made of graphite.
Why does graphite serve such a wide
variety of uses? The reason why graphite
is so diversified is because of its unusual
and numerous physical and chemical
properties. Its physical properties alone
afford many uses for this ore. All natur-
al graphite occurs in crystalline forms,
but industrial nomenclature classifies it
into three groups: "amorphous," "crys-
talline," and "flake." The "crystalline"
and "flake" forms come under the gen-
eral term of "cryptocrystalline masses."
The distinguishing factor between these
two classifications is that crystalline forms
can be seen by the naked eye, whereas
the structure of amorphous graphite is
only visible by x-ray diffraction.
Combinations of these forms are com-
monly found in nature. Though these
forms differ in appearance, they have the
same chemical properties. The "flake"
and "crystalline" varieties retain their
fish-scale-like property even after being
pulverized. "Amorphous graphite" can
easily be ground into fine particles. In
industrial applications, the "flake" and
"crystaline" forms can be used for all
purposes while the "amorphous" form is
limited to applications in specific fields.
These forms are found in particular
parts of the world. "Amorphous graph-
ite" is chiefly found in Mexico and Cey-
lon, other sources include Korea, Cana-
da, and China. "Flake" forms occur
mainly in Madagascar but are also found
in Kenya and Germany. The "crystalline"
form is found in Ceylon, Germany, Ko-
rea, and Norway. The United States has
a fair supply of natural graphite. How-
ever, it is of a low grade and importing
it from a foreign country is cheaper
than mining and processing it here. Or-
dinarily, only high-grade graphite min-
eral which contains 70 to 90 percent
graphitic carbon is imported.
The mining and benefication of graph-
ite varies with its forms. The ore is
mined from underground mines and
open pits. Crushing, screening, flotation,
budding, winnowing, and air separators
are the means which are usuallly used to
remove impurities. Cheap labor in for-
eign countries also affords manual pro-
cessing. This work is usually done near
the mine for this main reason and then
shipped to be further processed and put
to use.
Properties
Before the use of graphite can be dis-
cussed, consideration of its chemical and
physical properties should be taken be-
cause certain products are dependent on
these properties.
Natural graphite is an allotropic form
of carbon which is usually found in a
mixture of clay, iron, oxide, mica, and
other minerals. When compared with
carbon's other allotropic forms, striking
contrasts are found. The diamond is
transparent and harder because of its
atomic stucture. The distance between
each carbon atom in a diamond molecule
is symmetrical throughout. On the other
hand, the unequal distances between the
atoms in graphite account for its physical
properties of being black and crumbly.
Diamond dust would scratch and gouge
machinery, whereas graphite is unctuous.
Graphite's plate-like microstructure can
also be attributed to its crystalline form.
In its valence-bond structure, graphite
has one double and two single bonds
between each carbon atom. Resonance
between the bonds results in the bonds
possessing a 1/3 double bond character
and a 2/3's single bond character. Cleav-
age between the layer of sheets in a
crystal occurs readily, for the sheets are
weakly held together by van der Waals
forces. This crystalline bondage is the
major reason why graphite is a good
lubricant.
The structural state of the crystals
also accounts for other properties. Graph-
ite burns slowly, marks readily, and is
almost chemically inert. Other proper-
ties of major importance are: the flexibil-
ity of its temperature range, its high
conductivity of heat and electricity, its
negative temperature coefficient for re-
sistivity, its excellent weathering proper-
ties, its tendency to produce water-in-oil
type emulsions, and the fact that it readi-
ly dissolves in iron.
Manufacturing
Natural graphite's major function is
in the manufacture of refractory crucibles
which are used for melting nonferrous
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The ore provides the following properties
which are necessary in a good refractory
crucible:
(1) high thermal conductivity
(2) high electrical conductivity
(3) low thermal expansion
(4) highly refractory
(5) high resistance to metal and flux
attacks
(6) thermal plastic properties at ele-
vated temperatures
Graphite is bonded with clay or pitch
by a dry or wet mixing of water. If
clay is used, so is the wet mixing and the
materials are usually mixed in a Mueller-
type mixer. It is important that the graph-
ite flakes do not crumble, and this
mixer does not tend to break them up.
Next the plastic material is aged for
several days. After that it is pressed,
spun, extruded, or hand-formed into
shape.
If pitch-bonded refractories are to be
made, the mixture is placed in a blade-
type mixer, which is heated. Both types
are fired under reducing conditions at
temperatures varying from 750 to 1350
degrees C. The product's ability to with-
stand low temperatures gives it resistance
to thermal shock. Its refractoriness al-
lows it to be continually used at elevated
temperatures with fusion.
There are many other refractory graph-
ite products. Graphite is used in stoppers
and nozzles to be used in metal process-
ing. Here it affords resistance to heat
shock, erosion and corrosion, withstands
deformation at high temperatures with-
out cracking and minimizes heat conduc-
tivity. It is also used in retorts, stirrers,
and cements.
Pencils
The most widely known use of graph-
ite is in pencils. Graphite, clay, and other
materials are baked at temperatures rang-
ng from 1,500 to 2,000 degrees Centi-
grade for several hours. Proportions of
the ingredients vary with the hardness of
the "lead" to be produced. Graphite of
high carbon content which is finely
ground is used in the better, more ex-
pensive pencils. Either "flake" or "amor-
phous" graphite is used.
The greatest amount of graphite is uti-
lized in the production of numerous
foundry facings. Amorphous graphite is
usually employed. Graphite is the mate-
rial most extensively used in this field of
manufacturing, though others are also
used. Mica, sand, clay, and talc of ex-
treme fineness are combined and pro-
cessed. Very little processing is needed,
because as long as the compound has
the proper fineness, there is no other
special requirement for facing products.
The combination is pressed into parts
and heated. Sometimes brass finishings
are added to a high grade of graphite to
obtain a superior finish.
Carbon Brushes
An article on graphite would be in-
complete without mentioning that it is
used in making electrical contact brushes.
Brush grades are usually classified accord-
ing to the manufacturing processes in-
volved and the nature of graphite and
carbon used. These classifications gen-
erally include:
(1) carbon and carbon-graphite —
high hardness, high mechanical
strength, and a pronounced clear-
ing action.
(2) electrographic-amorphous carbon,
when submitted to high tempera-
tures in an electric furnace, phys-
ically changes to a more graphit-
ic structure.
(3) graphitic-crystalline graphite is
mixed with a binder and pressed
into blocks and fired. Desired
physical properties are depend-
ent on the degree of the firing
temperature.
(4) metal-graphite — metallic pow-
ders, usually copper, and graph-
ite are sintered below the melt-
ing point of the metals involved.
The greater the metal content,
the higher the current densities
which can be used and the great-
er the mechanical strength of the
brush being produced.
The list of graphite products could be
extended indefinitely. Lubricants, metal-
lurgies graphite, paints, roofing com-
pounds, fillers for batteries, steam and
pump backings, and furnace linings are
some of the other applications of graph-
ite in the commercial arts.
Artificial Graphite
General Electric discovered that dia-
monds plus heat yielded graphite, but
there was no profit in this. Actual artifi-
cial graphite was accidentally discovered
as a result of a mistake by E. G. Ache-
son. Today, more artificial graphite is
produced by a Niagara Falls corporation
than is imported from foreign countries
annually. But artificial graphite is very
inferior to natural graphite as a lubricant,
because it contains only 0.5 percent sili-
con carbide, whereas the silicon carbide
content of natural graphite is 5.0 percent.
The silicon carbide plus petroleum
coke, anthracite coal and other carbon
compounds are bonded together with a
pitch binder and graphitized in an elec-
tric furnace of 1,000 horsepower rating.
Industrial products which are made of
articfiial graphite include packing mate-
rial for delicate electric-lamp filaments,
electrodes, in atomic piles as moderators,
and electro-plates.
Recent Discovery
Late in November last year, the Ray-
theon Company developed a new graph-
itic material called "pyrographite." The
material vaporizes at 6,350 degrees Fahr-
enheit—the same as ordinary graphite
(which is the upper limit for any elemen-
tal material). This new product's thermal
and electrical conductivity is strongly
anisotropic. It has a high density and im-
permeability to gases. It is hoped that
this new material will be useful in mis-
sile nose cones and rocket engines to
operate at greater temperatures. Its use-
fulness in missile nose cones is afforded
by its extraordinary ability to conduct
heat 100 times better along certain sur-
faces than perpendicular to them.
It seems that the atoms in the crystal
of this substance align themselves almost
parallelly, providing a much stronger
structure than ordinary graphite. It is
being used for military purposes now and
research is being done to see how well it
would serve as a light-weight insulation.
Few (and in some cases no) substi-
tutes exist for that small but very impor-
tant mineral, graphite. Natural supplies
are abundant and there is no concern
about a shortage of it. However, the
United States imports the greatest ma-
jority of its graphite from other countries
and if we were cut off from our supplies,
it would necessarily be produced at great
expense and its value would greatly in-
crease. The only Canadian producing mill
closed down in 1954, so we could not
turn there for a source. But since depos-
its lie in such a great many places which
are distant from one another, a supply-
seems assured.

The heart of the success-failure determination
of guided missile flight, the double-integrating
accelerometer, determines rocket thrust, missile
velocity, and distance with errors as low as one-
tenth of one percent, and all in one package.
By JOHN P. PALMER
Everyone who drives an automobile
knows that the speedometer is an
indispensable instrument for good, ac-
curate, and lawful driving. Although a
good driver can develop a certain "feel"
for the handling of his automobile, this
by no means compensates for the speed-
ometer itself. Even if we were to equip
our automobiles with automatic "chauf-
feurs," there would still be the need for
a physical device to indicate the speed of
the vehicle.
Similarly, ships, airplanes, and guided
missiles need a means for measuring not
only instantaneous velocity, but accelera-
tion and distance as well. In the case of
the guided missile, the instantaneous ac-
celeration at all times must be known as
an indication of the thrust of the rocket
motors. The instantaneous velocity is
necessary at all times for confirmation
of the missile trajectory, or path to be
followed by the missile. Distance indica-
tion is a convenient means of denoting
the proper time at which the missile's
warhead should be armed, since in most
cases, explosive warheads are not armed
until the last minute before they are to
be triggered. The device commonly used
to determine these quantities is the ac-
celerometer.
In order to visualize more clearly just
what the principles of an accelerometer
are, let us consider what is meant by
acceleration. Now, the average velocity of
a body is defined as the change in dis-
placement of the body divided by the
corresponding period of time, and, simi-
larly, the average acceleration of a body
is defined as the change in velocity of that
body divided by the period of time. Thus
if at any given instant in time we know
how the displacement is changing with
time, we know the velocity at that in-
stant, and, if we know how the velocity
is changing with time, we know the ac-
celeration at that instant.
Now, in the course of firing a guided
missile, it is necessary to have a knowl-
edge of these three quantities: displace-
ment, velocity, and acceleration. Let us
see how they can best be determined. Sir
Isaac Newton, around the year 1700,
came up with a truly remarkable discov-
ery which supplies a very convenient
method for determining acceleration first-
hand in terms of much more readily
measured factors: namely, that the ac-
celeration of a body equals the force on
it divided by its mass. This is commonly
known as Newton's second law of mo-
tion. As a simple example of how New-
ton's method works, consider the shoot-
ing of an arrow with an ordinary bow.
During the period between the time the
drawn bow string is released and when
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


maximum velocity, the arrow is being ac-
celerated. Now, Newton's method of
determining acceleration says that if we
know the mass of the arrow and the
force exerted on it by the bowstring, we
can calculate the acceleration of the
arrow while it is being pushed by the
string. The mass of the arrow is deter-
mined by weighing it and dividing that
weight by a constant gravity factor, g.
We know the force exerted by the bow
string on the arrow, because it is speci-
fied by the manufacturer. Thus a simple
division gives us the average acceleration
of the arrow.
In order for us to use Newton's sec-
ond law as the fundamental working
principle of an accelerometer to deter-
mine the acceleration of a vehicle, and
thereby determine its instantaneous veloci-
ty and distance from take-off, we must
apply the reverse procedure. (The mathe-
matical term used to describe the process
used in these definitions above is, of
course, differentiation.) The reverse pro-
cess, i.e., the process we are to use, is
known as integration. We shall integrate
the initially determined acceleration with
respect to time to determine velocity-,
and we shall integrate velocity with re-
spect to time to determine distance.
There are two entirely distinct proce-
dures we can use to determine the first
and second integrals of acceleration, and,
in fact, both are commonly employed.
One procedure has been devised more
recently than the other, and has definite
advantages over the original. The origi-
nal procedure is to employ an accelerome-
ter which gives an electrical impulse cor-
responding only to the acceleration of
the vehicle. This type of accelerometer
is known as the non-integrating acceler-
ometer. The impulse corresponding to
the acceleration is fed to a computer
which then performs both integrations.
If the accelerometer gives an output sig-
nal accurate to 0.1 per cent or better of
full scale, i.e. at maximum acceleration,
the electrical integration processes pro-
duce as much as 3 per cent overall veloci-
ty error and five per cent overall distance
error. The more recently-developed pro-
cedure is to employ what is known as the
double-integrating accelerometer. As its
name implies, the double-integrating ac-
celerometer delivers electric signals cor-
responding to acceleration, velocity, and
distance. There is no need for an inte-
grating computer, and the errors involved
in such operations are removed. Indeed,
only the errors of the accelerometer re-
sponses are introduced, and these are as
low as 0.1 per cent for each of the three
responses, acceleraton, velocity, and dis-
tance. Consequently, the two major ad-
vantages of the double-integrating accel-
erometer are the reduction in space con-
sumption and the reduction in overall
error.
In this paper we shall examine the
operation of the double-integrating ac-
celerometer to see how the acceleration,
velocity, and distance of the vehicles are
determined, and how this information is
relayed to the proper vehicle components.
It must be noted that there are several
configurations of double-integrating ac-
celerometers produced by different manu-
facturers, and the particular specimen
we shall examine is called a torsion-reac-
tion double-integrating accelerometer.
The torsion-reaction accelerometer is
essentially composed of two coaxial fly-
wheels, one built inside the other, and a
d-c electric motor, as shown in figure 1.
The internal flywheel is mounted rigidly
on its shaft, which is also the driveshaft
of the d-c motor. The d-c motor housing
is in turn secured to the external fly-
wheel, both of which are mounted on a
second shaft which is freely supported by
the accelerometer housing assembly. The
motor rotor and driveshaft and the in-
ternal flywheel constitute the rotor assem-
bly. The external flywheel and the motor
housing constitute the stator assembly.
Thus, the rotor, stator, and fixed housing
assembly are designed so that the rotor
can rotate within the stator, and the
stator can rotate relative to the acceler-
ometer housing.
The objective of this system is to pro-
vide the information necessary to deter-
mine, first of all, the acceleration of the
vehicle. Therefore, the system must pro-
vide a force-mass ratio. Let us see what
arrangements must be made so that we
can choose the stator of the above con-
figuration as the "arrow" of our system,
i.e. the effective mass. If we can now
find a force exerted on the stator which
is directly proportional to the accelera-
tion of the vehicle, we may be able to
harness the results of this force together
with the mass of the object exerting this
force to give us an indication of the
acceleration. Let us attach a counter-
weight to the stator near its circumfer-
ence. The effect of this counterweight
will be to unbalance the stator, and
thereby convert it into a pendulum. Now,
let us consider the case of a pendulum
consisting of a string with a loop at one
end through which we place a slender
rod. To the other end is attached a fairly
heavy ball. Now, let us take hold of the
rod with the string and ball, or pendu-
lum, hanging beneath. As we move the
rod in a horizontal direction at right
angles to the rod from an initial state
of rest to a certain velocity, the pendu-
lum will move through a certain arc. In
other words, the ball will tend to trail

two, and the position of the string be-
fore the motion is started and after the
given velocity is reached will define an
angle. The magnitude of this angle is
determined by the change in velocity,
whereas the rapidity with which the
angle is inscribed is determined by the
acceleration we give to the rod. This is
exactly analogous to the motion of our
stator assembly under an acceleration of
the vehicle in a direction normal to the
axis of rotation of the stator, neglecting
the rotor. At an initial velocity, V,, the
stator with its counterweight will assume
a given position. As we change this
velocity, i.e. accelerate the vehicle, to an-
other velocity, V2, the stator rotates
through an angle proportional to the
change in velocity, and the speed at which
the angle is changing at any instant is
proportional to the acceleration of the
vehicle.
However, we have not yet suggested
a way to measure this force and transfer
it into an electrical signal for the proper
components of the vehicle. This is where
the rotor comes into play. Let us attach
an electric switch to the accelerometer
housing so that as the stator turns
through a very small arc due to accelera-
tion of the vehicle, it closes this switch.
Let the switch be connected to the d-c
motor so that when the switch is closed
power is supplied to the motor, and the
motor applies a torque to the rotor.
When the switch is open, the rotor coasts
to a stop. Let us suppose that the stator
is deflected through a clockwise angle
and closes the switch to the motor. If
the motor applies a starting torque in the
clockwise direction to the rotor, the same-
torque will be applied to the stator in
the opposite or counterclockwise direc-
tion, since one is connected to the shaft
of the electric motor, while the other is
connected to the motor housing. As an
example of this action-reaction pheno-
menon consider holding the drive-shaft
of an electric motor in your hand without
touching the motor housing, then turn
the motor on. The shaft will remain
stationary in your hand while the rest
of the motor rotates about it, say in a
clockwise direction. Now, release the
drive-shaft, and hold onto the motor
housing, the shaft spins in the counter-
clockwise direction. If you hold onto
both the shaft and housing with both
hands, you feel a torque in one direction
in the left hand, and a torque in the
other direction with the right hand. They
are necessarily equal and opposite (ac-
cording to Newton's third law of mo-
tion). Now, the acceleration of the
vehicle has caused the stator to rotate
clockwise and close the switch. This
energizes the d-c motor, which applies
a starting torque to both the rotor and
stator in opposite directions. The torque
applied to the stator is counterclockwise
and moves the stator away from the
switch against the force of the accelera-
tion. As soon as the switch opens, the
torque is no longer applied by the motor,
and if the vehicle is still accelerating,
the stator again moves clockwise and
closes the switch. Now, this process can
happen as often as 200 times a second.
We now have a means of determining
the force of the counter-balance on the
stator due to an acceleration normal to
its axis of rotation, and this is just what
we were looking for. In fact, the rate at
which these pulses increase is in direct
proportion to the force due to accelera-
tion exerted by the counterbalance on
the stator, divided by the mass of this
counterbalance, or in other words, the
rate of increase of the pulses is in direct
proportion to the acceleration of the
counterbalance, which is the acceleration
of the vehicle.
We may also note that the accelera-
tion has already been integrated to the
velocity measurement, for the velocity is
simply in direct proportion to the rate of
occurrence of the pulses or the number
of pulses per unit time. Finally, the ac-
celeration has been integrated a second
time, because the distance traveled by the
vehicle is merely proportional to the
total number of pulses at any given
instant.
We have not yet considered the case
where the missile is decelerating. But,
this is a simple matter, since we need
only place an identical switch at the
other side of the arc sudtended by the
stator. That is, if the vehicle decelerates,
rather than accelerates, the stator will be
forced to move in a counter-clockwise
direction until it closes the switch on this
side of the swing. This switch must be
connected to the motor in the reverse
manner of the former switch so that the
motor will exert a counterclockwise,
rather than clockwise torque to the rotor,
and thus apply a clockwise torque to the
stator until the switch is opened. We can
see the analogy with the string pendu-
lum used previously. Once the rod above
the pendulum is in motion, and we begin
to slow it down, the pendulum swings
out in front of the rod, rather than be-
hind the rod as in the case of accelera-
tion.
As the output signals from the accel-
erometer are accumulated, they are re-
layed to various components of the
missile that need this information, such
as the automatic arming device for the
explosive warhead, and they are trans-
mitted to the ground station for a full
analysis by the ground crew. Thus, both
the missile intelligence built into the
missile and the ground base have an
excellent concept of how the missile is
handling.

New Miniaturization
Developed for Polaris
Guidance Computer
An electronic assembly technique which
can cut equipment size by eighty per
cent with welding techniques and wire-
ribbon matrix interconnections gets its
first public exhibition at the Institute of
Radio Engineers 35th Annual Conven-
tion in New York.
The new technique, known as "Mini-
Weld," achieves the maximum possible
ultra-miniaturization of standard elec-
tronic components. This development is
particularly applicable for missile and
space probe hardware. MiniWeld con-
struction is used in the newest Polaris
missile guidance computer. This unit
achieves five times the packing density
of the conventional printed board con-
struction for electronic hardware. A new
welded matrix method makes possible
the interconnecting of the MiniWeld
modules with a minimum of spar/: loss.
During the assembly process nickel
ribbon wire leads are virtually woven to-
gether. The standard components are
stacked in contact with each other be-
tween mylar film. Then various sub-

Electronic components are stacked into a modulle like cordwood and then sand-
wiched between sheets which contain the welded matrix in this elctronic module
using the "Miniweld" process.
By CHARLES MASSER
circuits and components are welded to-
gether to complete modules. The entire
element is finally "potted" by encasing
in an insulating compound which makes
it highly resistant to shock and vibration.
The MiniWeld technique is a devel-
opment of Sippican Corporation and
Francis Associates, both of Marion, Mas-
sachusetts. Sippican has been producing
prototype MiniWeld assemblies including
the Polaris guidance computer for the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and the U.S. Navy. Engineered Electron-
ics Company develops and manufactures
solid-state and vacuum tube packaged
electronic circuits and will mass produce
MiniWeld modules and other equipment
with the same techniques for national
consumption.
New Research in the Field of
"Free Radicals"
A radioactive ball, smaller than the
head of a pin, has made it possible to
trap and study atoms that are responsible
for triggering most chemical reactions,
including those involving living cells, a
Ford Motor Company scientist an-
nounced. Dr. John Lambe, of Ford's
Scientific Laboratory discussed this new
method of capturing "free radicals" at
the opening session of the American
Physical Society at the Institute of Arts.
The radioactive element used in the
new process is tritium, similar to hydro-
gen, but heavier and having a different
nucleus. Changed from its natural gas-
eous form into a solid by immersion in
liquid helium at -450°F., the tritium
molecule decomposes, with one of its

are extremely reactive and combine read-
ily with everything with which they come
into contact, the super-cold temperature
is necessary to slow down this tendency
to recombine and permits them to be
studied with magnetic equipment.
By applying microwaves of uniform
frequency but varying magnetic fields
to single atoms of tritium, the nature
and the magnetic qualities of the sub-
stance can be determined by noting the
amount of microwave energy absorbed.
An atom is, in effect, a bar magnet due
to the motion of electrons; similarly is
the atom's nucleus an even smaller bar
magnet due to the action of nucleons.
By using microwaves to incline the axes
of these magnets, a process known as
paramagnetic resonance, the differences
between tritium and hydrogen are read-
ily apparent when their nuclear magnets
are compared, and the differences be-
tween the nuclear and electron magnets
in the tritium atom also can be noted.
Measurement of the wavelengths yields
additional data about the impurity of the
atom.
This is the first time tritium in a solid
form has been studied by paramagnetic
resonance. Radioactive materials previ-
ously have been used as tracer elements
in scientific research, but with a distinct
difference from free radical work. In
tracer work, investigators were interested
in the decomposition and decay process
of an atom; in Dr. Lambe's work, the
interest lies wholly in the free radical,
the atom that remains after decay has
taken place.
A New Fused Silica Mirror

The largest fused silica mirror ever
made will serve as the primary reflective
piece in a 36-inch telescope to be carried
aloft by an unmanned balloon for outer
space photography. The mirror blank
which was produced by Corning Glass
Works measured 37 inches in diameter,
514 inches thick, and weighed 450
pounds. The blank—or boule—is being
precision ground and finished by Perkin-
Elmer Corp., Norwalk, Conn., for in-
stallation in the telescopic system the
firm is constructing for Project Strato-
scope II.
Goal of the project is to obtain photo-
graphs of planets and other celestial
bodies at altitudes above the turbulence
of the earth's atmosphere. It is planned
to send the balloon to an altitude of over
80,000 feet. Dr. Martin Schwarzschild,
of Princeton's Department of Astronomy
and director of the project, said the bal-
loon flight is scheduled for sometime in
1961.

The project is forerunner to pro-
posed satellite observatories and follows
the successful balloon flights under Proj-
ect Stratoscope I in which a 12-inch tele-
scope provided the clearest pictures yet
taken of the sun.
With the larger telescope, it is ex-
pected that new photographs will provide
information on the atmosphere of Jupi-
ter and Venus, permit analysis of the
division of Saturn's rings, and provide
a means of measuring the diameter of
Pluto. The project also may shed further
light on the Great Nebula in Orion
where new stars apparently are forming
in dense interstellar clouds.
Fused silica was specified for the tele-
scope mirror because of its near-zero
thermal expansion. Sudden and severe
temperature changes will not alter shape
of the mirror, thus assuring distortion-
free images. It is said to be one of the
purest man-made substances since im-
purities average less than one part per
million.
A Tenth Planet?? No
February 11, I960, The New York
Times and many other American news-
papers carried the story that Russia had
discovered a new planet beyond Pluto.
The source of the information was the
Khazakhstanskaya Pravda newspaper. It
stated that a new planet was discovered
accidentally by Edward Denisiuk at the
Kazakh Academy of Science Observatory.
At that time there were not enough
photographs to calculate the orbit of the
planet. Recently, however, additional in-
formation has been compiled with the
use of better equipment. The object is
NOT a trans-Plutoian planet but an
unlisted asteroid.
Optical surface of a big fused silica
telescope mirror—produced for outer
space photography—is checked after
precision finishing operation.

sounding out man's environment and
pursuing relentlessly the task of assem-
bling all phenomena within a framework
of physical law and order. However, as
observations improved and measurements
became more exact, the axiomatic founda-
tions of the scientific temple began to
crack. Repairs were undertaken immedi-
ately. More constants were added to the
equations of state, as gases were ob-
served to depart from their ideal beha-
vioral patterns. Throughout the sciences
nature began to reveal a distaste for the
strict laws of cause and effect. Even the
lofty second law of thermodynamics felt
the effects. As Dr. C. F. Prutton and
Dr. S. H. Mason put it, in their text,
Fundamental Principles of Physical Chem-
istry, "Although the second law was once
considered to be of universal validity,
certain phenomena observable in con-
junction with the Brownian movement
have sharply brought to the attention of
scientists the fact that the law applies
strictly only to systems composed of large
numbers of individuals. For instance, in
observing in a colloid the random motion
of particles which constitutes the Brown-
ian movement, it is found that most of
the particles move from the more concen-
trated portion of the field to the less
concentrated, as may be expected. Occa-
sionally, however, just the reverse takes
place, and a particle moves toward the
more concentrated portion of the field.
This is in violation of the second law of
thermodynamics. To meet this contingen-
cy, the second law is at present consid-
ered to be strictly applicable only to sta-
tistical systems involving large numbers
of particles, but not to the individual
units of a system. That this is the correct
view is borne out by the connection which
can be shown to exist between the sec-
ond law and the laws of probability
governing the behavior of systems con-
taining large numbers of molecules."
Through such occurrences the word "im-
probable" and the mathematical tool of
probability gained new importance as a
weapon in the scientific battle for under-
standing.
Fresh Outlook
From the midst of the turmoil, a new
look into the origin of life emerged in
1936 with the publication of The Origin
of Life, written by A. I Oparin, a Russian
scientist. From this new start, a modified
spontaneous theory gradually gained im-
petus until today it holds a respected
place in scientific thought. More sophis-
ticated than its maggots-from-meat, mice-
from-garbage predecessor, the theory to-
day leans heavily upon the concepts of
mathematical probability and geological
time. Man has not, as yet, recorded any
observation of living organisms gener-
ated from nonliving substances. As a
consequence of this fact alone, the first
impulse is to assign a probability of zero
to the occurrence or, in non-mathematical
terms, to state that the occurrence is im-
possible. The error of such a conclusion
is clearly demonstrated by the evolution-
ary theory. Man's own observations, even
if they were carefully recorded and pre-
served from the dawn of civilization,
could not begin to reveal the changes
which Darwin attributed to evolution.
The simple reason is that man's record
would encompass a span of only thou-
sands of years while the process of evo-
lution is intimately tied up with millions
and billions. The prejudice resulting
from just this sort of erroneous reason-
ing, no doubt, contributed in part to the
public furor which greeted the publica-
tion of The Origin of Species in 1859.
With this admonition in mind, the
only course left open is to assign some
probability, no matter how small, to the

TIROS satellite orbiting towards ground station in Eastern United States.
RCA-BUILT"TIROS" SATELLITE REPORTS
WORLD'S WEATHER FROM OUTER SPACE
As you read these lines, the most remarkable
"weather reporter" the world has ever known
hurtles around our globe many times a day,
hundreds of miles up in outer space.
The TIROS satellite is an orbiting television system.
Its mission is to televise cloud formations within a belt
several thousand miles wide around the earth and trans-
mit a series of pictures back to special ground stations.
Weather forecasters can then locate storms in the making
... to help make tomorrow's weather forecast more
accurate than ever.
The success of experimental Project TIROS opens the
door to a new era in weather forecasting—with benefits to
people of all lands. This experiment may lead to advanced
weather satellites which can provide weathermen with hour-
by-hour reports of cloud cover prevailing over the entire
world. Weather forecasts, based on these observations, may
then give ample time to prepare for floods, hurricanes,
tornadoes, typhoons and blizzards—time which can be used
to minimize damage and save lives.
Many extremely "sophisticated" techniques and de-
vices were required to make Project TIROS a success—
two lightweight satellite television cameras, an infra-red
horizon-locating system, complex receiving and trans-
mitting equipment, and a solar power supply that collects
its energy from the sun itself. In addition to the design
and development of the actual satellite, scientists and
engineers at RCA's "Space Center" were responsible
for the development and construction of a vast array
of equipment for the earth-based data processing and
command stations.
Project TIROS was sponsored by the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration. The satellite pay-
load and ground station equipment were developed and
built by the Astro-Electronic Products Division of RCA,
under the technical direction of the U. S. Army Signal
Research and Development Laboratory.
The same electronic skills which made possible the
success of man's most advanced weather satellite are em-
bodied in all RCA products—RCA Victor black &amp; white
and color television sets, radio and high-fidelity systems
enjoyed in millions of American homes.

The steam locomotive is dead.
Her last stronghold fell to the omnipresent diesel last
month when the Grand Trunk Western Railroad abandoned
the use of the steamers on the local run from Detroit to
Durand, Mich.
Local railroaders stated that they believed that this repre-
sented the last use of steam locomotives in regular service on
any major U. S. railway.
Most railroads had capitulated much earlier than the
GTW. Some railways have been all-diesel over a decade.
The funeral was well attended. About 2,500 mourners,
some from as far away as Cincinnati, were on hand to ride
behind the coalburners. The train had to be run in two sec-
tions. In all, 32 coaches were filled. The railroad could have
filled many more, if they had them.
The engines doing the honors on the last run were 4-8-4
(Northern) type engines of the 6300 class. These machines
were primarily passenger engines, but with a starting drawbar
pull of 59,000 pounds, they were husky enough to handle
freight easily.

The word space commonly represents the outer, airless regions of the universe.
But there is quite another kind of "space" close at hand, a kind that will always
challenge the genius of man.
This space can easily be measured. It is the space-dimension of cities and the
distance between them ... the kind of space found between mainland and off-
shore oil rig, between a tiny, otherwise inaccessible clearing and its supply
base, between the site of a mountain crash and a waiting ambulance—above all,
Sikorsky is concerned with the precious "spaceway" that currently exists be-
tween all earthbound places.
Our engineering efforts are directed toward a variety of VTOL and STOL
aircraft configurations. Among earlier Sikorsky designs are some of the most
versatile airborne vehicles now in existence; on our boards today are the ve-
hicles that can prove to be tomorrow's most versatile means of transportation.
Here, then, is a space age challenge to be met with the finest and most practical
engineering talent. Here, perhaps, is the kind of challenge you can meet.

phenomenon in question. Indeed, if it
is assumed that the organism is to arise
from the nonliving as a product of ran-
dom interactions of countless atoms, then
remembering the extremely complex
structure of even the simplest living or-
ganism, the probability of such an event
must be exceedingly small.
In order to better understand the situ-
ation on the basis of probabilities, con-
sider for a moment that classical device
known as a roulette wheel. Picture, if
you will, such a wheel with ten evenly
spaced compartments. However, instead
of the usual alternating red and black,
this wheel has only one red pocket, the
remaining nine having been painted
black. Assuming that the arrangement is
"honest," the ball with which the game
is played, will have one chance in ten of
landing in the red space. Conversely, the
probability that it will not land in the
red pocket is 9/10. Suppose now, that
it is desired to have the ball land on red,
just once and that there is no limit on
the number of times which the game may
be played. The probability that the ball
will not land on red on the first try is
9/10. The probability that it will not
land on red in either the first or second
tries will be (9/10) (9/10) or 81/100.
Similarly, in six tries, the probability of
not landing on red once, will be 521,441
in a million or slightly more than 1/2.
It is now evident that as the number of
trials increases, the chance of not land-
ing on red decreases significantly. On the
other hand, the event of landing, at least
once, in the red compartment, becomes
more and more likely as the number of
trials increases. Obviously, if the experi-
ment is repeated over and over again,
the ball will eventually find its way into
the red pocket. This line of reasoning,
applied to an event such as the sponta-
neous generation of a living thing from
nonliving substances, leads to a similar
conclusion. No matter how slight the
probability of this event may be, given
time for a sufficient number of trials, its
occurrence becomes inevitable. In the
case of life generation, the trials might
conceivably involve random collisions
and interactions of the atoms which nuke
up the organism.
Briny Beginnings
In a search for the first form of life,
the evolutionary road seems to lead
through time and place to the sea some
two billion years ago. Here in a warm
primeval soup of atoms, molecules, salts
and water; innumerable collisions and in-
teractions could occur until the inevi-
table came to pass—life. But what of
the forces of destruction such as decay
and oxidation which continually act
upon all living things? The peculiarities
of the primordial earth seem to answer
this question. To begin with, biological
decay involves the action of living organ-
isms and could therefore pose no threat
to the first of their kind. As to the ques-
tion of oxidation, authorities generally
agree that free oxygen was practically
nonexistent in that age. It was present
almost solely in the form of metal oxides
and water. Probably more significant

than any external forces was the potential
self-destruction of this early life-form.
Its very existence was threatened most
by its own inherent instability. A prod-
uct of chance, through a myriad of re-
versible reactions, the probability of its
dissolution increased overwhelmingly
with every passing moment of its exist-
ence. The only way that it could survive
was to bolster its precarious equilibrium
by absorbing energy from outside itself
or, to put it in another way, by living off
its surroundings. It seems likely that this
first living thing achieved self-susten-
ance by extracting energy from its neigh-
bor molecules through some process like
fermentation. Typical of such a process
is the yeast fermentation of glucose to
yield ethyl alcohol, carbon dioxide, and
energy according to the equation:
CsH12O0 -► 2CO + 2C2H5OH + energy
The carbon dioxide by-product played
an essential role in this epic, for its grad-
ual accumulation in the atmosphere pre-
pared the way for a new and startling
process—photosynthesis. As Rachel Car-
son writes in, The Sea Around Us, "By
this time some of the living things that
floated in the sea must have developed

the magic of chlorophyll. Now they were
able to take the carbon dioxide of the
air and the water of the sea and of these
elements, in sunlight, build the organic
substances they needed." The basic chem-
ical reaction for this process can be writ-
ten:
6COa + 6HaO + sun energy -» CaH12Oa
+ 6b,
Again, a by-product opened the door to
a new way of life. Free oxygen, hereto-
fore unavailable, was to appear in abun-
dance—dissolved in the waters and blend-
ed into the atmosphere. With it came a
still more advanced creature, one liber-
ated from poverty-stricken existence by
the most efficient of all life-sustaining
processes, respiration. Chemically, this
process is identical to the burning of fuel
in a furnace. It yields tremendous
amounts of energy in comparison with
fermentation and photo-synthesis. For
the first time a life-sustaining process
yielded a surplus of energy—extra en-
ergy available for dynamic growth and

change. The accumulation of oxygen in
the atmosphere did another thing, too.
Until its arrival, the earth was contin-
ually subject to the bombardment of
harmful ultraviolet radiation from the
sun. Life was safe only immersed in the
protective waters of the sea. In time,
however, some of the oxygen, converted
to ozone, found its way into the earth's
upper atmosphere to form a shield
against the ultraviolet radiation, making
it possible for living creatures to emerge
from the sea and continue their evolu-
tionary march on land.
Life from the Lab
Of course all of the foregoing is, of
necessity, conjectural. But the reasonable-
ness of such a series of events has spurred
many eminent researches to attempt to
duplicate the process in the laboratory.
The results of one such project were
made public during the 1959 convention
of the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science. As reported in
Time, January 11, I960, Biochemist Sid-
ney W. Fox of Florida State University
reported progress toward creating life
in the laboratory. Experimenters have long
known that when a mixture of methane,
ammonia, carbon dioxide and water vapor
(all probable constituents of the earth's
primitive atmosphere) is bombarded with
electric sparks of high energy radiation,
amino acids are produced. Amino acids
are the building blocks that form multi-
tudinous proteins in living organisms,
and Dr. Fox carried the process a step
farther. When he heated a mixture of
amino acids with polyphosphoric acid as
a catalyst, he got big molecules with
many of the properties of proteins, i.e.
they have similar chemical characteris-
tics, are digested by natural enzymes and
are eaten greedily by bacteria.
When Dr. Fox dissolved his semi-
proteins in hot water and let the solu-
tion cool, billions of microscopic spheres
separated out of each gram. The spheres
were about the same size as cocci (primi-
tive bacteria), and they seemed to be
sheathed with thin membranes much as
bacterial cells are. Dr. Fox does not
claim that his spheres are "alive", but
he thinks his experiment demonstrates
one possible means by which nonliving
chemicals in the earth's primitive ocean
may have been gathered together into
cell-like units of life."
Perhaps even more fascinating are the
cosmological implications of earth's life.
At that same scientific convention, Nobel
laureate geneticist Herman J. Muller of
Indiana University expressed the belief
that something similar to earth's life-
forming process probably happened on
millions of other planets in the uni-
verse, with the likely production of high-
ly intelligent creatures. In all, life and
everything associated with it provides a
seemingly endless frontier to challenge
man. Like the universe and the atom,
life's puzzle seems to grow more complex
as its solution progresses. In any event,
one of the most striking aspects of the
whole thing is the penetrating manner
in which age-old answers yield up-to-
date explanations, when they are inter-
preted in the light of modern knowledge.
For example, according to Genesis 1:20.
"God said, let the waters bring forth
abundantly the moving creature that
hath life."

So they all folded their hands, put

After everything was quiet again, the

This is the inside of the blast pit of one of the

1,950 tons of reinforcing steel, over 48,000 tons
of concrete aggregate, blocks and cement,
and 8,040 tons of mechanical steel items.

Fuel lines and process piping are Stainless
Steel and operate at pressures up to 15,000

to prevent contamination of fuel and subse-
quent malfunction. Vapor degreasing and
chemical cleaning processes are used on
the pipes.

you ever hear or read about. Ac-
tually, they're only a small part of
the missile program. Most of the
manpower and material go into
ground support equipment. There
are over 11,000 tons of steel and
over 48,000 tons of concrete aggre-
gate, blocks and cement in the six
launching service buildings at this
site alone.
United States Steel can supply
virtually all of the material for a
missile program — carbon steels,
high-strength low-alloy steels, ultra-
high-strength alloy steels, Stain-
less Steel, steel fence, electrical
cable, cement and wire rope.
The success of our whole missile
program depends upon these ma-
terials. And upon manpower. Here's
where you fit in: it takes trained en-
gineers and men of many other pro-
fessions, such as those interested
in financial analysis or sales to
research, develop and produce
these steels. If you would like to

On the riddle of
rolling friction
General Motors is pioneering research into the mystery of energy losses in the rolling ball. "With a unique
measuring device (above), investigators have not only confirmed the hypothesis of how a rolling ball loses
energy (Answer: elastic hysteresis), but have also learned where this lost energy is dissipated (Answer:
in the interior of the material, not on the surface).
The effectiveness of automation depends upon the ingenuity of the scientist and engineer. If
you are about to begin a career in the field of technology you'll benefit yourself by working
where ingenuity and enthusiasm pay off. At General Motors they do, and in a big 'way.
What is your main interest? GM's diversification covers many fields. Automotive research,
production engineering and manufacturing, electronics and astronautics are just a few. With
so many and varied divisions, GM can offer men who qualify the choice of specialization or
the opportunity to work on vastly different projects.
If you are an undergraduate, or if you are working on a postgraduate degree, GM has a
financial aid program that you should look into. For complete information, write to General
Motors, Personnel Staff, Detroit 2, Michigan.

Tke £ditot5 Pen —
Here at the start of another school year it seems fitting to
devote a portion of this space to a discussion of what the
late Dean George Granger Brown described as "a highly
successful and respected tradition"—the Honor System in
the College of Engineering. We do this not in the form of
an admonition or an appeal but as a basis for enlightenment
of new students and a basis for reflective thinking by old
students.
Our feeling towards the Honor System is aptly expressed
by a statement in the booklet given to all incoming students:
"It has become a fine tradition of the students of the Engi-
neering College . . . How much this tradition means to you,
you will not appreciate till you have been here for a time."
It doesn't take too much effort to recall our freshman
days several years back and the fact that the Honor System
meant little at the time. Among our classmates there seemed
to be a general attitude of doubt and cynicism towards the
Honor Code and its value. Quite possibly this is the early
attitude of most freshman classes.
After we had "been here for a time" however, this atti-
tude began to change, slowly and unnoticeably, but moving
toward a new viewpoint. For most of us a day came—maybe
it was the first time we had a class in Lit school or during
that first tense final exam when we discovered we were free
to leave the room and wander in the halls till we had re-
laxed—when we suddenly did appreciate the value of the
Honor System to ourselves and to the profession of engi-
neering. It is our conviction that students, whether they be
new or old, eventually come to feel this way towards the
Honor System, just as students in the College of Engineering
have felt since the system was founded in 1916.
We hope that the day when all the Colleges in the Uni-
versity will adopt a similar system is not far hence because
we cannot express strongly enough the value of the Honor
System in the development of character and in the exercising
of a responsibility by the student to himself and his fellow
engineers.
Another subject of interest to most students, especially
seniors, is the engineering placement picture. In a later issue
the Technic will deal more fully with this subject but a few
highlights from the 1959-60 College of Engineering Place-
ment Report should be of interest.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The most significant trend last year was the fact that
both salaries and recruiting activity reflected a substantial
increase in the demand for engineers, according to Prof. J.
G. Young of the Placement Office. However, this didn't lead
to a complacent attitude on the part of the students because
their efforts to find a job appeared to increase as well.
These trends lead us to the fact that Mr. Average Student
interviewed 10 companies, received 5 offers that averaged
$537 month, and accepted an offer at about $524/month.
Prof. Young reports two other interesting trends, one
being the slowing down of a flight to the West Coast in
favor of the Mid-West. This is probably due to the general
slowdown in the aircraft industry. More important was the
fact that the number of students accepting employment with
medium sized firms (500-5000 employees) jumped from
18*/c to 34% while those going with large firms (over 5000
employees) dropped from 72% to 55%.
Although the Placement Office offers no predictions for
this coming year it seems quite likely that the upward trend
that has existed for several years will continue as long as the
economy as a whole remains steady.
As a rebuttal of the oft-repeated charge that engineers
are good for only running a slide-rule, I urge you to read
the winning Tau Beta Pi pledge essay entitled "On Intel-
lectual Duality" which appears on page 32. Not only is it a
fine piece of writing and evidence of sound thinking but the
challenge it presents warrants our utmost consideration.
Another short essay which appears on the last page of
this issue is an interesting footnote to history. Originally
appearing in the January, 1933 Tecbnic, it is amazing how
apropos this essay is to the present situation.
After having the opportunity to work in industry for a
summer it is our conclusion that on the job experience is im-
measureably beneficial to the educational process. It would
be our suggestion, although probably an impractical one to
implement, that all students be required to gain some prac-
tical industrial experience in industry during the summer
between their junior and senior years.

There are many opportunities for
mechanical engineers at Bethlehem Steel
You'll find a mechanical engineer designing complex ma-
chinery for a new rolling mill. Another is supervising
construction of a giant blast furnace. Another is develop-
ing improved production methods. Others design tools, are
in charge of plant maintenance divisions, or head up fuel
departments. Others are in sales work. In fact, Bethlehem's
president is a mechanical engineer.
The point is simple: there's virtually no limit to the op-
portunities at Bethlehem Steel for men trained in mechani-
cal engineering.
If you're looking for a real opportunity to put your
training to work, with a company that appreciates the tal-

ents of mechanical engineers and has plenty of use for
them, look into the possibilities at Bethlehem Steel.
Bethlehem offers excellent career opportunities
for men in virtually all engineering curricula:
metallurgical, electrical, chemical, industrial,
civil, mining, ceramic, architectural, and others.
We suggest that you discuss Bethlehem with
your Placement Officer. And be sure to
pick up a copy of our booklet, "Careers with
Bethlehem Steel and the Loop Course."

research. "Find the truth of a matter first, then adapt that
truth to the industrial needs of the day." This is the attitude
of the research staff of The Dow Chemical Company. In
new and expanded facilities across the United States, in
Canada, and overseas, Dow research continues to embody
this philosophy on which the company was built. It is note-
worthy in the history of Dow that parallel to the steady
growth of the company has been a steady increase in the
number of research personnel. With this attitude toward
research, Dow will continue to find and invent new and better
processes and products, and at the same time to offer the re-
search-minded person an ideal atmosphere for development.
resources. When someone told Herbert H. Dow that there
wasn't enough bromine available in the earth, he made his
now famous statement, "We'll have to mine it out of the
ocean, then." This is characteristic of the Dow attitude
toward resources. It is true that the chief raw materials for
virtually all the Dow products are sea water, brine, petro-
leum, coal, and oyster shells. It is also true that the Dow
attitude toward resources has led to an extremely broad and
beneficial exploitation of these common materials. Dow
thoroughness in the handling of all resources has led to the
industry axiom, "If it's Dow, it's backed by complete
technology."
results. Even with such a short list of raw materials as
Dow employs, a complete exploration of these materials will
take you into medicine and biochemistry, agriculture, metal-
lurgy, dyestuffs, solvents, plastics, and just about every other
field as well. And Dow gets results. Many of these bear
well-known names like saran and Saran Wrap*, Dowgard*,
Styrofoam®, Lurex®, and hundreds of others. And the end
is not in sight. Each new product suggests its successor, and
it's the rare item that can't be improved. Hence, as it must
be in every healthy company, every effort is made at Dow
to see that research produces new results from the available
resources.

A Technic editor returns from a summer in
Alaska and reports on the opportunities for
young engineers that he found there.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE,
Associate Editor
Alaska's largest atomic power
plant is rapidly being completed.
The plant, a pilot project, is lo-
cated at Fort Greely, and is Alas-
lea's second atomic power plant.
I have recently returned from a rather
extended tour of Alaska. My pri-
mary concern while shuttling about the
49th state was not sightseeing, however,
so much as a sort of "prospecting." With
my senior year at the University now
dead ahead, instead of just a foggy vision
in the indefinite future, I have been
jogged into a more serious contempla-
tion of what is to become of me after
leaving the halls of ivy. This is not an
unusual phenomenon. Hundreds of my
classmates are now casting about for the
most interesting, or rewarding, or re-
munerative job prospect. Interviews, of-
fers, and applications will be the leading
topic of thought and of "bull sessions" in
the months to come. And additional
thousands of underclassmen are also (or
should also) be keeping abreast of late
trends in engineering employment.
So, while in Alaska, I prospected for
jobs. The results of my investigation were
rather surprising, even though I have
followed Alaskan affairs with consider-
able interest for years. But before any
presentation of specifics, let's look at
some of the reasons why our huge new
state should be of interest to young
engineers.
First, I would like to consider the
character of an engineer. He is tradition-
ally (and I hope that the tradition will
be maintained) a man of vision, of defi-
nite creative ability, with an ambition to
design and build newer, greater things
to serve mankind better. He must never
become a mere technician, nor allow the
caliber of his work and thought to rele-
gate him to the dustbin of the well-super-
vised engineering team. His ambition
should force him above the anonymity
of being a well-oiled cog in a solution-
cranking-out machine. His task is to lend
useful form to the discoveries of science,
and to do so well he must not only pos-
sess a superior grade of technical know-
how, but he must give plentifully from
his integrity, his understanding of the
significance of a job, and his desire to
surmount all problems in a personally
satisfying way. If any of these personal
elements is missing, the engineer risks
becoming a mere hack or drudge.
These qualities of the character of an
engineer tend to make new frontiers
necessary to him. These frontiers can be
scientific or technical, but they can also
be geographical.
If we think back to high school days,
or whenever the desire to enter engineer-
ing first came to us, these notions may
seem more familiar. What was it that
first sold us on engineering? Was it the
lure of high pay? Was it our skill in
science or math? Or mechanically-oriented
hobbies? Perhaps. But very likely many
of us will recall a sort of pioneering in-
stinct calling to us. The urge to build.
To develop. To conquer. To see cities
rise from the wilderness and bridges
span great rivers. Possibly it was a dream
of great dams and high-tension wires,
bringing factories, towns, and cities into

The energetic and forward-looking citizens of Anchorage have made this one of the
fastest-growing cities in America.
existence where yesterday there were
none. Or was it mines and wells, tapping
the wealth of the earth, where but a
short time ago the sod lay unbroken and
the riches therein unknown and unused?
Whatever your dream was, friend engi-
neer, where is it now? Will graduation
find your talents forever entombed in
some antique pesthole of an industrial
complex, cobwebby and mired in policy,
red tape, lines of authority, committees,
et al.? Or will you risk a few fringe
benefits on the possibility of a refreshing,
rewarding career on the frontiers of
knowledge or of civilization?
There are a number of such frontiers.
It is by no means necessary to exile ones-
self to the ends of the earth to find them.
However, Alaska has so much to offer,
and so much can be said here without
exhausting the subject, that this discus-
sion will be limited to this state. Need-
less to say, no such restriction applies
to the philosophical content of this re-
port, but I must limit my factual account-
ing to what I have seen.
Alaska is big. Plunk it down on top
of the older 48 states, and it reaches
from North Carolina to California, and
from Mexico to Canada. This is the result
of a very irregular shape, but the actual
land area alone is about 2/5 the size of
the older states. The climate varies enor-
mously, from strictly Arctic to Minne-
sota type. About half of the state is mild
enough so that Michiganders would ex-
perience no great discomfort upon living
there year-round.
Cities up there are few, extremely few,
considering the size of the place. How-
ever, they lack none of the comforts of
other U. S. cities, and Anchorage, the
largest (82,500) is one of the finest
cities to be found anywhere. With two
TV and five radio stations, two daily
papers, wide, paved streets, and all man-
ner of completely modern stores and
buildings, Anchorage is a comfortable,
sophisticated place to live. The same is
true to a lesser extent of the other Alas-
kan cities, many of which present an un-
usual contrast between pioneer and mod-
ern character.
Outside the cities and towns, the emp-
tiness of the countryside is quite a reve-
lation. The desolation is at once exciting
and depressing. An enormous amount of
hard work and money is needed to
raise it above the level of an economic
desert, yet the magnificence of the op-
portunity is invigorating.
Despite the rapid pace at which the
development of Alaska has proceeded in
the last decade or so, it is fair to say
that the surface has scarcely been
scratched. Perhaps the thing that strikes
the visiting engineer most strongly (as
far as job opportunities go) is that most
of the potential jobs for him haven't
even been created yet.
In Alaska, an engineer does not merely
visit a company recruiter or scan the
classified ads to get a job. Sure, this can
be done sometimes. But most of the jobs
in Alaska have not even been created yet.
To get started up there, a young man will
likely need more than a sheepskin or a
few years' experience. He will need a
fistfull of dough. He will need brains
and ambition and guts. But if he is
lucky, he will get back everything he puts
in, and plenty more.
The present economy of Alaska seems,
to me, to be very unsoundly based on
military expenditures. Presently, federal
spending is at the root of a very active
economy, with timber harvesting, some
oil exploration, transportation, fishing,
some farming, and an infant mining in-
dustry riding along. Any significant de-
crease in military construction would kick
the stilts out from under the economy in
very unceremonious fashion. Recovery,
while certain, would be painful and slow.
Nonmilitary economic activity in Alas-
ka is either extractive in nature (lumber-
ing, farming, fishing) or in support of
military operations (most mining and
transportation). There is no noteworthy
process or manufacturing industry. In
the event of military pullout, the sup-
porting industries would be curtailed.
The extractive industries are generally
seasonal, largely staffed with migratory
or native labor, and do not support any
substantial resident White population.
An unusual condition exists in the
skilled trades. Despite very high wages,
there is a great deal of unemployment,
and local unions advise those seeking em-
ployment in carpentry and steelworking,
or electricians, plumbers, truck drivers,
and masons not to try Alaska without
prior assurance of a job.
For engineers, the prospects are a
little brighter. Immediate employment
for virtually any kind of engineer or
architect can be obtained with the State
Department of Public Works, or with
other State or Federal agencies. These
jobs generally involve road, bridge, and
highway location and construction; equip-
ment maintenance; school design and
construction, or like fields. Electrical en-
gineers with a yen to work outdoors can
secure well-paid jobs in communications
or in radar and missile-defense setups.
And there is usually a scattering of other
openings in any field outside of manu-
facturing and most types of research.
The enormous opportunity for engi-
neers, however, is in the opportunities
that are never advertised—those for men
with a lot of initiative and a little capi-
tal. For in Alaska's resources lies the fu-
ture of a good portion of U. S. industrial
production. While the present market
and transportation picture deals Alaska
out as a supply, production (and there-
fore) population center, the outlook must
certainly change as we use up the re-
sources and even the empty space of the
rest of the nation. Indeed, some phases
of the unprecedented Alaska boom to
come can already be forecast without too
much supposition.
The Army Corps of Engineers is cur-
rently making an extensive study of a
proposed hydroelectric dam of the Yukon

generation capacity would exceed 5,750,-
000 kilowatts—more than Hoover Dam
and Grand Coulee combined, or more
than the whole of the TVA. Several
auxiliary dams would raise the total
even higher—near eight million kilo-
watts. The price tag—a billion dollars—
but that's still dirt cheap power. This
project may be under way in ten years
or less.
Another project of enormous scope,
but also a ten-to-twenty year prospect, is
the construction of a rail link to Alaska.
Presently there is a modern, well-main-
tained 470-mile railroad in Alaska, but
no connection to the rest of the U. S.
An economic study is being prepared for
the government at Battelle Memorial In-
stitute. It is anticipated that the report
will be unfavorable for the present, but
that it will recommend construction after
Alaska has matured somewhat further.
Price tag—about 300 million.
(In the case of the two projects listed
above, note that the government has been
the only party to express an interest in
building them. It is to be hoped that
private capital will also give considera-
tion to these projects, both of which
seem to possess great merit as invest-
ments.)
Fossil fuels will undoubtedly contrib-
ute to the industrial economy for which
Alaska appears destined. Both coal and
oil seem to be present under the state
in large quantity. Several operating coal
mines serve local needs, and a possible
export market to Japan. A few oil wells
have been brought in, as well as good
gas wells. Development of this industry
awaits further exploration, and the con-

struction of storage, transport, and pos-
sible refining facilities. Most major oil
companies have teams in Alaska this
year.
Iron ore is only one of the minerals
that are present in abundance. A moun-
tain of magnetite near Klukwan has been
assayed at a billion tons. The bugbear
again is transportation plus wages, but
as we go farther and farther afield for
iron ore, its commercial possibility looms.
Coupled with hydro power, Alaska could
support a large electric-furnace steel in-
dusty. Suitable alloying materials are
nearby—chromium, vanadium, tungsten,
manganese, and others.

dustrial engineering, is currently

Council.
A further catalog of Alaska's natural
features which will someday support a
population of millions would only be
repetitious. There are thousands of small-
er opportunities, some of which can be
opened up by a single engineer with a
few thousand bucks to invest. They are
not all in mining, although that field
dominates the immediate picture. What
about chemicals? With countless ores,
and lots of coal, gas, and cheap power,
there is a future industrial giant. Or
forest products industries—lumber, pulp,
plywood, furniture, cellulose, and chem-
icals? Telephone communications is an
open field, with private interests grad-
ually buying up the government-oper-
ated systems. Gypsum and cement are
future industrial prospects of note. All
forms of transportation offer expansion
opportunity. Various types of heavy-
goods manufacturing will also come in
time, probably in the wake of primary
industries such as metallurgy and power.
In summary, I can only urge engineers
to inquire into what Alaska has to offer
to men of their own specialty and their
own interests and tastes. Expect to cre-
ate your own job, or to have to sit tight
until it is created. Don't start packing
your bags this June—but don't forget
about Alaska, either. Bide your time,
keep in touch with events, and marshal
your financial resources. When opportu-
nity knocks, have your boots on. See
you there!

This month's cover story explains an intriguing
method for propelling rockets through space
which may be the key to conquest of the
universe.
by ARTHUR CHARMATZ
One pound of thrust is seemingly a
small force in this age of 100,000
pound thrust rockets. Indeed, it is so
small that many a person cannot con-
ceive of a pound of thrust being used
anywhere in the realm of rocketry. Yet,
there is a domain in that world where
even one pound thrusts are ten thousand
times bigger than those considered high.
This domain is known as electromagnetic
propulsion, with propulsion by means of
ions an outstanding member of the do-
main.
With all the large, powerful rocket
motors that exist today, why then do
scientists work with such minute in-
fants? . . . solar system traveling would
be extremely expensive if not almost im-
possible by large rocket. The fuel of an
Atlas or Thor is used within the first
few minutes of flight time, and guidance
thereafter must be based on how good
guidance was before flame-out. Surely,
small vernier rockets and rockets of the
type which have motors which start and
stop would do the job after burnout . . .
but how long would the fuel last?
Travel between planets is not now
measured in hours, days or weeks, but in
weeks, months and years!!! In such
travels, maneuvering would certainly be
necessary for both orbital positioning and
evasion of space debris. These travels
facilitate the need for an ion propulsion
system; one with a long life, as few
parts as possible and one which can create
enough thrust to accelerate a vehicle at
a reasonable rate.
Long life is probably the one most im-
portant factor in an ion propulsion motor,
as the other factors can be reasonably met
once this is achieved. In order to achieve
long life for any one motor, certain pre-
requisites must be met. One specific con-
dition is ion beam neutralization. In or-
der to have an effective thrust the ion
beam must be neutralized either by elec-
trons or negatively charged ions if the
source of the beam is positive or by posi-
tively charged ions if the source is nega-
tive. The ion beam must be kept as close
to neutral as possible as any charge in-
crease, either positive or negative, will
result in a decrease of the interelectrode
field and the ion beam will be cut off
(and thusly no thrust will be created).
Whatever the neutralization media may
be (let us use electrons), acceleration
into the ion source electrode must be
prevented. Then, energy loss due to space
charge buildup is equal to the final po-
tential about the ion thrust system minus
the potential of the electron source. This
energy loss can be minimized by having
the final potential about the system just
slightly positive with respect to the elec-
tron source (and thus enabling the motor
by having as high an efficiency as possible
to have a longer life).
By neutralization of the ion beam we
mean that we are not usually recombin-
ing ion and electron but there will be
some tendency for this to happen. While
being accelerated not only recombina-
tion but collision may occur between ion
and electron. The chance of recombina-
tion or collision happening is relatively
slim and both seem to have a minor effect
on the ion beam.
A second condition of long life is
termed "ion source efficiency." Assume
that the final velocity of the ions and the
interelectrode spacings are fixed. Assume
further that the ion source is space charge
limited. The electrical power output per
cm2 of the ion source is then found to
vary as the square of the charge-to-mass
ratio of the ion. The ratio of the power
output of the ion beam to the power
input of the ion source is called the figure
or merit of a ion source. A useful ion
source has a figure of merit greater than
10, and a source lifetime comparable to
17,000 hours. The surface ionization of
cesium is a simple way of obtaining an
abundant supply of heavy ions. It shows
the most promise of having a high figure
of merit and a long lifetime.
A third proviso for long life has to

prevention of sputtering, an erosion of
material due to the bombardment of
high energy ions. This is an extremly
serious problem and upper limits to the
allowable sputtering must be set. If H
is the fraction of the accelerated ions
striking an electrode, it is found that if
electrode geometry is not to be appre-
ciably altered by sputtering, H must be
less than approximately 0.01%. If elec-
trode material is replenished, the upper
limit to H is approximately 1%. The
electric fields in an ion motor are always
adjusted so that the majority of the
accelerated ions pass right by the acceler-
ating electrode due to their high velocity
(almost the speed of light). A potential
positive with respect to the accelerating
electrode will extend in the region of the
beam an appreciable distance away from
the motor. Low energy ions formed in
this region will be accelerated to the
high voltage electrode. A good deal of
sputtering and electrode erosion will re-
sult which again lessens the lifetime of
the ion motor. These low energy ions
can be formed by charge exchange of a
high energy ion with a low energy neu-
tral and by the ionization of neutral
atoms by the neutralizing electrons.
Since we are to be traveling in deep
space the weight of the vehicle (on earth
at take off) is severely critical. Conven-
tional rockets must be used for the
nitial escape of the earth's gravitational
pull since an ion motor has no effect
on the earth's surface. Thus the ten-
dency has been toward making the
motor as light and as simple as possible.
As mentioned before the lifetime of the
ion source must approach 17,000 hours
or approximately two years. This source

Tungsten in combination with cesium will probably be used as the ion source. The
sputtering, or wearing away of material, is one of the most undesirable things that
can happen to the ion source. This must be prevented to allow a long lifetime for
the source.
is the basic fuel and is a great weight
reduction compared with liquid or solid
fuels. We cannot say how much the en-
tire motor will weigh as there are many
designs all having different weights but
none probably half as heavy as any of
the big rocket motors today. Parts within
the motor are few (no valves, etc.) and
can easily be replaced.
One thing that has not been mentioned
is the source of power to run the ion
source. This can be accomplished either
by having a small atomic power plant
aboard the vehicle or by using sunlight
itself. Preferably, sunlight would be best
as then there is no need for the rocket
to lift a somewhat heavy and bulky
atomic power plant from the earth. Also,
proponents of sunlight say that their
best argument is that the sunlight is
FREE.

Once out in deep space (free of the
earth's gravitational pull) we can sit
back, turn on the motor and start to ac-
celerate. We must realize that accelera-
tion will be enormously slow because as
mentioned before the thrust of an ion
motor is measured in micropounds. The
velocity of the beam of ions is about the
speed of light and the velocity that the
vehicle could achieve would be the vel-
ocity of these ions . . . but we must re-
member that we have a destination in
mind and that we also must slow down
before we get to wherever we are going.
To slow down or decelerate, all we have
to do is reverse the direction that the
motor is pointing towards and let the
motor run until we acquire the velocity
that pleases us. This is a delicate problem
as a velocity too high or too low may
send us traveling into deeper space or
plunging like a meteor into a planet's
atmosphere. The strange thing about ion
propulsion is the time involved to get
anywhere. One might think that the ex-
haust velocity of approximately the speed
of light would get us somewhere fast but
again the mass of the vehicle and the
need to reverse engines to slow down
makes any trip quite long. An average
trip would take us to Mars in eight
months to a year depending upon the
mean distance of that planet from the
earth at traveling time. Of course, the
most important thing is that after spend-
ing a year and a half to get out to Jupiter
we know that we have the fuel (and
naturally the time) to get back to good
old terra.

a rival with many unusual properties which may
yet further revolutionize schemes for electronic
amplification.

pany may not be the only people
possessing wrist radios. A new semi-
conductor device, the tunnel-diode, may
make possible such varied articles as
wrist radios, practical UHF television,
and faster computers. Just as the transis-
tor caused a revolution in electronics
when it replaced the vacuum tube, the
tunnel diode will probably cause another
revolution by replacing the transistor for
many uses.
In spite of its advantages, the transis-
tor has many drawbacks. It is a very noisy
amplifier, not very resistant to environ-
mental conditions such as heat or atomic
radiation, and, although much smaller
than the electron tube, the transistor still
leaves much to be desired in size reduc-
tion. The tunnel diode promises to elimi-
nate these and other disadvantages of the
transistor without adding any major dis-
advantages of its own.
The tunnel diode was not an American
invention. It was invented in Japan by
Dr. Leo Esaki, a thirty-four year old
physicist working for the Sony Corpora-
tion. Dr. Easki was engaged in basic
research on electrical "tunneling" in ger-
manium when he discovered the funda-
mental concept of the tunnel diode. Much
of the work involved in making the
tunnel diode a practical device was per-
formed in the General Electrical Research
laboratories in Schenectady, New York
by scientists Jerome Tiemann and Robert
Hall. More extensive research in tun-
nel diodes is now being conducted in the
RCA laboratories, Bell Telephone labor-
atories, and Air Force Cambridge Re-
search Center. The device is now being
marketed in sample quantities by General
Electric and RCA.
Theory
The concept which makes the tunnel
diode possible is a law of quantum me-
chanics. This law controls the action of
electrons through the semiconductor,
which forms the diode. Electrons can
possess only certain energy levels. The
range of energies between these certain
levels are "forbidden" levels. These levels
vary according to the material. By using
this fact, the tunnel diode makes it pos-
sible for electrons to "tunnel" through a
P-N junction causing amplification at
special energy levels. The P-N junction
in the tunnel diode is between the two
parts of the diode, a P-type semiconduc-
tor, and an N-type semiconductor. The
P-type semiconductor acts as an electron
acceptor because it contains vacant elec-
tron sites in the atomic structure of its
crystals. The N-type has a surplus of
electrons, therefore it acts as an electron
donor. When no outside source of elec-
trons is applied to the diode, the elec-
trons in both parts of the diode reach a
common energy level, and tunnel both
ways across the junction at the same
rate, causing no change in the net
voltage. This is known as zero voltage.
As the energy of the electrons in the
N-type semi-conductor is increased by
the addition of voltage from an outside
source, a current of electrons flows from
the N-type across the junction into the
P-type. The current in the diode at this
point behaves as it would in any regular
conductor, increasing as the added out-
side voltage is increased.
As the voltage is increased more, a
portion of the electrons in the N-type
semiconductor reach the energy levels
which are forbidden in the P-type area.
This means that fewer electrons can pass
from the N-type into the P-type, while
the same number as before can pass from
the P-type to the N-type region. This
causes a net flow of current into the N-
type region. In other words, an increase
in voltage at the N-type has caused a
decrease in current flowing from this
region. This phenomenon is known as
negative resistance. Any device of this
type, that is, one which can provide
negative resistance, can be used as an
amplifier or oscillator. Amplification is
accomplished by keeping the voltage in
the diode just below the point at which
negative resistance begins. At this point,
the small additional voltage caused by
a signal results in a large drop in voltage,
hence amplification. If the voltage is in-
creased appreciably beyond the forbidden
regions it again comes to a permitted
energy level, hence the diode again be-
haves like a normal conductor.
The design of the diode creates a
few problems. Because it can perform
amplification in only certain voltage
ranges, circuits will have to be redesig-
nated to allow its utilization. Also, the
P-type semiconductor has to be made
impure. This process, known as doping,
establishes the rate and position at which
negative resistance occurs. Therefore,
doping is a very delicate operation, de-
manding exact control.
Advantages
These are the main disadvantages of
the tunnel diode. The advantages are
many. The transistor, small in itself, is a
giant next to the tunnel diode. This size
reduction could make possible wrist ra-
dios, small size computers, and other
miniature devices.
Because of the extremely high speed
at which the change from regular to
negative resistance and back occurs, the
tunnel diode provides a high speed
switch—about a hundred times faster
than the transistors—for computers.
The tunnel diode is versatile because it
can handle a wide variety of frequencies.
This ability is especially important when
high frequencies are encountered, since
at these frequencies, transistors are use-
less, and vacuum tubes leave much to
be desired.
It uses very little power, one thousand
less than the transistor, one hundred
thousand times less than the vacuum
tube. This feature may make possible

At low temperatures, remarkable changes take
place in conducting materials so that electric
currents flow virtually without resistance.
By IRVING SALMEEN
The development of the relatively
new science of cryogenics, more
commonly known as low temperature
physics, has brought about the discovery
of a startling phenonmenon: super con-
ductivity. This phenomenon was first
observed a little over fifty years ago by
Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, a Dutch inves-
tigator into the behavior of substances at
very low temperatures. Onnes had cooled
a sample of mercury to about 4.2 degrees
Kelvin and passed an electric current
through the sample. A startling event
occurred: the mercury lost all of its
resistance to the flow of electricity; it
had become superconducting. Further in-
vestigations by Onnes and others showed
that many metals, when cooled to a few
degrees above absolute zero, would ex-
hibit the property of superconductivity.
Shortly after Onnes's discovery, W.
Meissner, a German physicist, observed
a strange property of metals in the super-
conducting state: they were impervious
to a magnetic field. When a supercon-
ducting sample was placed between the
poles of a magnet, the lines of force
passed around the sample and the field
was expelled by the metal. Since these
initial observations, a great deal of work
has been done in an attempt to construct
a comprehensive theory that adequately
explains the properties of superconduc-
tivity and the events that occur which
cause a metal to become superconducting.
The work began with the theory of nor-
mal conductivity.
Normal Conductivity
In a normal state, metals conduct a
current because of free valence electrons.
When voltage is applied the electrons
are accelerated by the added energy and
move through the crystal lattice of the
metal forming a continual flow or cur-
rent of electrons. But the electrons can-
not move unhindered because the paths
are distorted and obstructed by collisions
with atoms in an imperfect crystal lattice
and when other atoms, moving about as
a result of thermal agitation, collide with
the electrons. The greater the imperfec-
tions and the more intense the thermal
agitation, the greater the resistance the
metal offers to the flow of current.
By eliminating the obstructions, it
seems reasonable to assume that a metal
would become superconducting. There-
fore if one cooled a metal thermal agita-
tion would subside, and if the sample
were cooled to zero degrees Kelvin,
where thermal agitation would cease,
the sample should become super conduct-
ing if the crystal lattice were perfect.
But a law of quantum theory, Heisen-
berg's uncertainty principle, rules out any
possibility that a metal could become
superconducting even at zero degrees
absolute by showing that the vibrations
of the atoms are not totally dependent
on temperature. Briefly the principle
states that on the subatomic scale the
momentum and position of a particle
cannot be simultaneously and exactly de-
termined, and the greater the certainty
in determining one, the greater the un-
certainty in detrmining the other. Now,
if at zero degrees agitation nof the atoms
stopped, it would be possible to deter-
mine both position and momentum of
the atoms; momentum being zero and the
position easily observed. However, un-
certainty says that this cannot be done;
therefore only one conclusion can be
drawn: the atoms reach a so-called zero
point vibration at absolute zero. Because
the atoms never cease vibrating, a metal
cannot become super conducting accord-
ing to the theory of normal conductivity.
First Theories
For a long time no one ventured to
suggest a theory that would explain the
phenomenon, then about twenty years
ago a German physicist working in Eng-
land, Fritz London, suggested a theory
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


theorized that in the superconducting
state the electrons revolving about the
nucleus could move n unobstructed or-
bits. The orbital electrons were, in a sense,
in the same state as the free electrons of
a superconductor, that is they could move
uninhibited. London thought that an
external magnetic field would shift the
orbits in such a manner that they would
set up a counter magnetic field, one that
would expel the applied field. At the
time of the theory it appeared as though
a magnetic field was totally expelled by
the superconductor; however, later inves-
tigators determined that in many cases
there was slight penetration at the sur-
face, the depth of penetration being de-
pendent on the intensity of the applied
field and the temperature.
London's theory did not explain the
events that lead to the superconducting
state, rather it established a set of equa-
tions which reproduced the macroscopic
phenomena of superconductivity in a
similar manner as Maxwell's equations
describe the electro-magnetic field with-
out closely inspecting its origin. In re-
cent experiments, the equations have
become very useful in determining the
depth of magnetic field penetration be-
cause they are the only equations which
yield an exact solution.
In 1950, two men working independ-
ently, John Bardeen and H. Frohlich,
proposed a theory in an attempt to ex-
plain the events that caused a metal to
become superconducting. Their theory
was based on the interaction of the elec-
trons and the vibrations of the atoms in

the crystal lattice. The theory held that at
low temperatures the vibrating atoms
oscillate in a wave pattern and become
synchronized with the motion of the
electrons so that the electrons ride along
with the lattice vibration as a wave. In
effect the lattice becomes the agent of
conduction. Such a theory was suggested
by the fact that metals that were poor
conductors at normal temperatures were
most likely to become superconductors.
At normal temperatures the poor con-
ductors would have a strong ordering

Transition temperature, or temperature
at which a substance becomes super-
conducting, is related to the number of
its valence electrons. For example, the
transition temperature of lanthanum (La)
is 4.37 degrees Kelvin; while that of
technetium (Tc) is 11 degrees Kelvin.
Only one group of 13 superconducting
elements is shown; there is a second
group of 10 elements and a large num-
ber of compounds and alloys.
effect. Furthermore, the heavy elements
and compounds would be less likely to
become superconducting than light ma-
terials because the low temperature vibra-
tions would be slower for the heavy
metals than for the light ones. Later
tests proved this to be true.
Characteristics of Superconductors
The theory seemed to be sound, but it
still offered no dependable means of pre-
dicting which metals would become su-
perconductors. In 1950, John K. Hulm
and B. T. Matthias, working at Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories, began a series of
experiments by which they sought to
establish a pattern of physical and chemi-
cal properties that would characterize

conductivity on a magnetic field. The

metals that would become superconduc-
tors. The two experimenters began test-
ing compounds and elements, one by one.
Finally after three years the pattern be-
came clear. The most characteristic fea-
ture was the number of valence electrons
per atom. They found that compounds or
elements with an average of two to eight
valence electrons per atom were the ones
that became superconductors and those
within this range with an odd number
became superconductors easiest (at the
highest temperature). They also found
that crystal structure was important.
Compounds with a bulky structure and
a relatively large amount of empty space
were most conducive to the superconduct-
ing state.
After establishing this pattern the two
experimenters verified its reliability with
some striking tests. Technetium, a prod-
uct of uranium fission, has seven valence
electrons per atom, and becomes super-
conducting at the relatively high tempera-
ture of 11°K. The element before tech-
netium in the periodic table is molyb-
denum, with six valence electrons per
atom; it will not become superconducting
at the lowest attainable temperature of
one tenth of one degree Kelvin. The
element after technetium, ruthenium with
an average number of valence electrons
of eight, becomes superconducting at
.5°K.
They discovered that it was even
possible to make a superconductor of
two totally unfit materials. They made
an alloy of silicon and cobalt, silicon
being unsuitable because it is a nonmetal
and a nonconductor and cobalt because

ence electrons per atom. The two com-
bined to form a cubic structure, the
silicon neutralized cobalt's magnetic prop-
erties, the average number of electrons
was reduced to the proper range, and the
combination became superconducting.
Present Theory
With this empirical data to work with
and the Bardeen-Frolich theory, another
theory was presented in 1957 by John
Bardeen, Leon N. Cooper, and J. Robert
Schrieffer, which appears to account for
all of the important properties of super-
conductivity. The new theory, like the
first one of Bardeen and Frolich, was
based on the interactions between elec-
trons and the vibrational motions of a
metal's atoms.
They theorized that at low tempera-
tures interactions between the vibrations
of the atoms in the crystal lattice and the
motion of the electrons causes the elec-
trons in a superconductor to be associ-
ated in pairs. When voltage is applied
each pair is set into motion in such a way
that the net momentum of each pair is
the same, and when there is no voltage
the net momentum is zero. In the super-
conducting state there are no erratic
motions over the whole superconduc-
tor because each pair moves in the same
way. There is little or no interference by
the crystal lattic because it is the agent
by which the electrons move and be-
come associated in pairs.
Pardeen points out that to a small de-
gree electron scattering does occur local-
ly; however, this local scattering is not
sufficient to change the common momen-
tum of the electrons or the total current.
Once a current is started only an external
force that acts on all the electrons at the
same time, can change the current. The
theory appears to be sound in everything
except one point: the mathematical treat-
ment of the magnetic effect. Bardeen
feels, however, that the main part of
this explanation is in showing how the
electronic structure of the superconduct-
ing state with its associated electron pairs
differs from that found in normal metals.
Superconducting Thin Films
With the London and Bardeen-Cooper-
Schreiff theories to work, with experi-
menters have begun to investigate the
properties of the state in greater detail
and with more confidence. In 1956 super-
conducting thin films were developed.
(A thin film is an extremely thin layer
of a substance on the order of several
hundred to several thousand Angstroms
thick depending on the type of film.)
Before the advent of thin films most ex-
periments had to be performed on a
bulk superconductor, however this was
not too desirable because such things as
impurities and absorbed gas can have an
appreciable effect on the superconducting
properties. But the technology of making
a thin film makes it possible to greatly
decrease the chances of contamination.
Using thin films in superconductor ex-
periments, considerable work has been
done toward verifying the BSC theory.
Another useful application of thin
films has been in investigating the mag-
neic effect, particularly the penetration
depth. Experimentally it is easier to in-
vestigate this on a thin film than on a
bulk superconductor because the thin
film can be made of the same magnitude
as the penetration depth itself. While
using thin films, accuracy is increased
because the penetration value can be
obtained to the same accuracy to which
the dimensions of the sample are known.
However, with a bulk superconductor,
experimenters are only able to detect
changes in the depth and then to a small
degree. Both theories predict such pene-
tration and give equations for determin-
ing the depth, however, because of the
nature of each theory, the predicted depth
is different for each. In this aspect, the
London theory becomes more applicable
because the equations can be exactly
solved.
Applications
There are many conceivable applica-
tions of superconductivity, but present
technical knowledge is not sufficient to
make such applications feasible. More
work must be done on basic theory and
the technology of making superconduct-
ing metals and maintaining them in the
superconducting state. Once the phe-
nomenon is fully understood and super-
conducting metals can be made easily
and maintained in the state, one of the
first applications will be in high speed
computers. Speed and efficiency of i
computer are often severely limited be-
cause of power losses due to imperfec-
tions and natural deficiencies of present
electronic devices. Employing supercon-
ductors in a circuit would eliminate thi&gt;
problem. Other applications would b: in
devices that operate on very small currents
such as the transmission line from the
antenna to the amplifier of a radio tele-
scope, high speed switches and ultra
sensitive electrical measuring devices. As
indicated by these few applications,
superconductors will enable engineers to
design electronic machines using a mini-
mum amount of current without loss of
energy.

"Shop-Talk" conference once each year
accomplishes a meeting of scientific minds
that is even more satisfactory.
This year, at Standard's 18th Annual
Joint Technical Meeting more than 80
technical papers were presented to 350
technical experts and representatives of
other departments. Discussed were such
subjects as the potential use of atomic
energy as a commercial fuel source, elec-
tronic computer controls, and the use of
$80-an-ounce platinum in making higher
octane gasolines. In addition to these
formal meetings, small discussion groups
and conversations between individuals
contributed to the exchange of ideas. The
result was a stimulating five-day period
that saw new ideas take shape. The meet-
ing benefited everyone—scientists, the
company, and consumers.
This type of meeting, which Standard
pioneered, is another example of scientific
leadership by Standard, and another rea-
son why men with technical training find
a Standard Oil career offers unusual cre-
ative encouragements.

Lightweight Mirors for Space
Telescope
New lightweight mirrors of fused sil-
ica have been developed for use in mis-
sile, satellite, and airborne telescope
systems. Corning Glass Works is pro-
ducing mirror blanks made by an unusual
sandwich construction that reduces size
and weight of mounting and auxiliary
equipment, vital considerations in aero-
space telescopes.
Because they require less elaborate sup-
porting structures, these reflective disks
also offer an advantage in ground obser-
vatory installations. The mirror blanks
consist of two fused silica plates sepa-
rated by walls or tubes of the same high
purity glass. The rigs are permanently
sealed to each plate under intense heat.
With this type of construction, and de-
pendent on design, mirror weight can be
reduced to half that of a solid disk with
equal surface area, Corning said.
The near zero thermal expansion of
fused silica means the mirrors will retain
their shape under sudden and extreme
temperature changes. The ribs help main-
tain rigidity. These qualities assure dis-
tortion-free images even in hostile en-

mirror blanks in a wide range of sizes
and shapes and a variety of rib construc-
tions. Fused silica can be formed to meet
design requirements of virtually all tele-
scope systems.
Perfection of improved manufacturing
techniques enables the company to fabri-
cate the blanks in minimum time. Surface
of the blanks will accept any standard
reflective coatings and can be precision
ground and finished with standard optical
equipment. Clarity of the material allows
minute inspection of the piece before
finishing gets underway. Corning fused
silica, formed by a special technique de-
veloped by company research scientists,
is one of the purest man-made substances.
Impurities average less than one part
per million.
Thermoelectric-Thermonionic
Generator
Scientists have combined two ad-
vanced forms of power generation to
convert the heat of fission inside a nu-
clear reactor directly into electricity.
Dr. William E. Shoupp, technical di-
rector of the Westinghouse atomic pow-
er department, said that, for the first
time, a thermionic and thermoelectric
generator was built into a nuclear fuel
assembly and inserted into a reactor to
produce electricity.
This experiment, conducted by Peter
J. McCoy, was operated at the Westing-
house Testing Reactor at Waltz Mill,
Pa., and produced about one watt of
power. It was designed to determine the
feasibility of such a "dual" generator
without consideration of optimum effi-
ciency or high power output. Taking
part in the six-month development pro-
gram leading up to the experiment were
Dr. G. R. Feaster of the Westinghouse
electronic tube division, Elmira, N. Y.,
and scientists of the resea.-ch laboratories
near Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dr. Shoupp said there are significant
inherent power losses in today's nuclear
powered generating stations, caused by
the large temperature drop from the
center of the fuel elements to the outside
surfaces in contact with the cooling water.
While some fuel elements themselves
reach temperatures above 4000 degrees
F in the fission process, he explained,
nuclear scientists can get only about 600-
degree temperatures out of the fuel ele-
ments and into the surrounding water.
This limits the amount of heat which
can be taken from the fuel.

Diagram of the thermionic-thermoelectric generator. It converts the heat of fission
inside a nuclear reactor directly into electricity.
To use the heat energy at the higher
temperatures, Westinghouse scientists
built a fuel element with the thermionic
generator in its center and a thermoelec-
tric generator surrounding it. Both meth-
ods of converting heat directly to elec-
tricity operate on similar principles, but
operate most efficiently at widely diver-
gent temperatures. A thermionic gener-
ator operates at about 3500 degrees F—■
but will not function efficiently at tem-
peatures below 2700 degrees F. A therm-
oelectric unit, on the other hand, does
not operate at such elevated tempera-
tures, but works well in the temperature
range of 600 to 1800 degrees F.
By putting the two types of generators
in tandem, the heat passing through the
thermionic generator flows through the
thermoelectric unit. The elements are
wired in series to give a combined elec-
trical output over a very wide tempera-
ture range.
Dr. Joseph C. Danko, manager of di-
rect conversion activities at the atomic
power department said, "While this
experiment was just to determine feasi-
blity of the heat conversion system, the
development program will continue to-
ward the goal of increasing the efficiency
of the device."

DUALITY
The Technic presents this year's winning Tau
Beta Pi pledge essay.
by FRED SWINEHART
Not in definition, but discussion, let
us look at the nature of Intellec-
tualism, and especially the form it has
taken in modern society.
Looking back in time to the days of
Euripides and Aeschylus, to the times of
the Orestia and the other wonderful
works of the 4th and 5th century Athe-
nians, we become aware of the classical
ideas regarding the highest circles of
man's mental endeavor. Here is the con-
cern with the qualitative: the study of
man, the state; of the creative truths;
poetry, song, and the perfection of
sculpture. Surely, some of the most
moving and fundamental questions had
their initiation and first discussion here.
But even this early in man's efforts to-
ward the understanding of himself and
his world were spread the germs of a
coming schism, one that today affects
us all. One that we, as technical men,
must strive to mend.
The early natural philosophers, men
like Pythagorus and Archimedes, are fine
examples of the blending of mental
directions. These men, at this time,
could comprehend and be sympathetic
to the prime achievements by their con-
temporaries, whether in the fine arts, the
mathematics, or the enginering of the
day.
This ability, and indeed the desire of
men to know and hold the TOTAL pic-
ture of intellectual accomplishment as
a thing of high value is spread through
the ages; highlighted by names like
Michaelangelo, Galileo, Francis Bacon,
Ben Franklin and thousands of lesser
lights. This desire is with us still, but
since Maxwell's time, it has become in-
creasingly difficult to satisfy.
The first real jolt the classical intt-1-
lectual received was, I suppose, when
Darwin's theory was formally proposed.
Here was an interesting situation. This
was, of course, a scientific triumph of
the first magnitude. Yet it was couched
in terms that an intelligent layman could
think in, and was able to discuss. I feel
that this was probably the last of the
great achievements of the mind of man
that the bold intellect, whatever his
training, could intelligently discuss.
How long did Maxwell's truly phe-
nomenal results go unknown to the "ed-
ucated man"? What is known today, by
many of our own most celebrated "in-
tellectuals" of Einstein, or Bohr or
Schroedinger? How about our "egghead"
statesmen, our "high powered" play-
wrights; our lawmakers and lecturers,
those pillars of society that have no more
feeling for an orbiting sputnik than for
hydro-electric power; and for either less
than the mere word "infinity." (One of
many which they find themselves alto-
gether too eager to use.)
What has happened? Here are the
supposed giants of our culture walking
around in ignorance (not of existence
but of content) of what are unquestion-
ably the supreme mental achievements of
the ages.
A wall seems to have arisen between
the technical man and the classic scholar.
Its magnitude you may judge for your-
self. Just look around. Get away from
your workbench and ask your banker, or
your lawyer, "What is Hooke's Law?",
or "does E = IR?", or "What keeps the
moon up there?" Some may know, but
fewer than you may realize. Something
has sprung up between our worlds; al-
though this wall doesn't bother you and 1
when we go the other way. For cannot
we read Shakespeare and Voltaire, appre-
ciate Renoir and Gaugin, or hear Beetho-
ven and Tschaikowsky? Certainly the
works of T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden
are familiar to us all. Or are they? And
if not, why not? It may sound foolish at
first, but the reason is clear. There are
very real and definite doubts and fears
that linger in us all when we are faced
with departures as radical as these from
our accustomed thought patterns.
To us, as technical people, brought
up in a world speaking the language of
the great masters just mentioned, this
departure is not one tenth as evident as
the one the classically educated man
faces. Our world's literature is displayed
in a field of differential equations, its
pastoral scenes in the flowing curves of
a thousand data correlations, its sym-
phonies the blending of an algebraic
language and mathematical thought. It
is no wonder that the non-professional,
upon first contact, finds himself amazed
and recoils from the further probing of
our seemingly incomprehensible and ter-
rifying environment.
I feel that we as technical people must
do what we can to heal the cleft that
has opened before us. The exact man-
ner of accomplishing this is a personal
matter, but as ever, the first step is the
definition of the problem. What follows
is, I suppose, in the form of a challenge,
and one well worth taking up ...'
charge you, scientist, engineer, and
mathematician, to discover the wall;
look over it and around it . . . above all,
destroy it. To replace it by a door asks
too much, but a clear pane of glass
would be a wonderful thing!

AND
RESEARCH
Edited by CHARLES MASSER
Radio Waves From Space
University of Michigan scientists have
measured radio waves from the planet
Saturn and from a planetary nebula—a
remote and gas-surrounded dying star,
the University's head of radio astron-
omy reported here today. U-M Professor
Fred T. Haddock reported these first
clear and unambiguous detections and
measurements of Saturn and a planetary
nebula to the 13th General Assembly of
the International Scientific Radio Union.
The findings are basic contributions to
scientific knowledge. They could also
help save money in future planetary ex-
ploration and possibly lead to modifica-
tion of theories of planetary nebulae.
The measurements were made with
the U-M's high precision 85-foot radio
telescope through the use of a new and
highly-sensitive ruby maser amplifier.
This amplifier was developed by the
University's Willow Run Laboratories in
an application of its earlier discovery, in
1957, of maser action in ruby. "The
maser developed by WRL made it prac-
tical to get these results," Professor Had-
dock said. "Without it, it would be a
long-time, uncertain and tedious process."
The measurements were made by Jerald
J. Cook, 27, (of Kalamazoo) and Lloyd
G. Gross, 2 5, (of Flint), of Willow Run
Laboratories and by Alan E. Barrett
(Ph.D.) and William E. Howard III
(Ph.D.), (both of Ann Arbor) of the
Radio Astronomy Observatory. Cook and
34
Cross also designed, built, and installed
the ruby maser amplifier.
Saturn's atmospheric temperature was
found to be 100 degrees Kelvin (minus
283 degrees F.), about the temperature
expected on the basis of optical studies.
The naturally-generated radio waves are
emitted from various depths in the plan-
et's atmosphere, Prof. Haddock pointed
out. The measurement may make possible
study of the temperature and density of
the rings of Saturn and of the distribu-
tion of gases in Saturn's atmosphere.
Precise measurements at a number of
frequencies are needed for this, Profes-
sor Haddock pointed out. The U-M find-
ings are accurate within 10 per cent,
which Haddock termed "pretty good."
Planetary nebulae are stars, like our
sun, which, however, are in the last
stages of their lives. Each consists of a
small hot central star surrounded by a
very thin "high vacuum" gas cloud some
millions of millions of miles in diameter.
The central star in each is atomically
burning itself up; its mass turning into
energy which excites the gas particles
giving off radio waves. Measurement of
a planetary nebula—in this case one
3,000 light years away designated NCG
(New Galactic Catalog) 6543—-is sig-
nificant because these sources are small
and very distant. Their radio emission
has been looked for for some time but had
not been definitely measured before. Such
measurements can help determine elec-
tron densities in the gas envelope, Prof.
Haddock said.
"Combined with optical and addi-
tional radio measurements, it will be
possible to shed light on the evolutionary
processes of stars, the physical character-
istics of planetary nebulae, and perhaps
detect both the existence of magnetic
fields in nebulae and cosmic ray elec-
trons surrounding these nebulae," he
pointed out. Together, optical and radio
observations can thus help astronomers
determine how stars age and die.
Professor Haddock said radio astro-
nomical observations of the planets will
be basic to their later exploration by
space probe instrumentation and by man,
and could thus save millions of dollars
in space exploration planning. For in-
stance, radio studies of Jupiter revealed
intense radiation belts that could dam-
age electronic equipment and photo-
graphic recording film on a space probe
sent there. And the surface temperature
of Venus has been found by radio as-
sronomers to be much hotter than ex-
pected—around 580 degrees (F). Only
radio astronomy could discover this be-
cause the planet is enshrouded in a
permanent cloud cover.
The measurement of Saturn and NGC
6543 are due largely to the ruby maser
amplifier. The maser's value to radio
astronomy lies in its relative absence of
the self-produced static inherent in stand-
ard radio receivers. This static can drown
out weak incoming signals in conven-

was developed by Willow Run Labora-
tories as part of its Project MICHIGAN,
under the sponsorship of the U.S. Army
Combat Surveillance Agency. This par-
ticular application is but one of many
now underway throughout the country,
based upon WRL's discovery in 1957 of
"maser" (Alicrowage /Implification by
Stimulated Emission of Radiation) action
in ruby.
The U-M's radio telescope, dedicated
last October, was built by the U-M with
the support of the Office of Naval Re-
search. The scientists of WRL and the
observatory are now striving for other
findings and further equipment develop-
ments. Cook and Cross are planning im-
proved maser receivers for the telescope,
while they and the astronomers are con-
tinuing to search for and measure new
and significant celestial sources. They
are enthusiastic over the prospects. "New
technological developments make it ap-
pear possible to improve the performance
of the maser receiver 10-fold, while
making its operation very much easier,"
said George Mahkov, acting head of
WRL's Solid-State Physics Laboratory.
In 1958, radio astronomers Frank
Drake and Harold Ewen reported briefly
getting one signal from both Saturn and
another planetary nebula using a 28-foot
telescope and a traveling wave tube (con-
ventional) receiver. The uncertainty of
this reported single observation has led
radio astronomers generally to regard
their findings as inconclusive.
Aid For Phoenix Project
A check for $50,000 has been received
by The University of Michigan as the
first of five payments comprising a gift
of 5250,000 from the Ford Motor Com-
pany Fund to the U-M's Phoenix Project.
Similar checks will be presented by the
Ford Motor Company Fund each June
over the next four years to aid the Uni-
versity's Michigan - Memorial - Phoenix
Project, a campus-wide research program
in peaceful uses of atomic energy.
The Ford Motor Company Fund gift,
accepted by the Regents at their last
meeting, brought to over $1.9 million
the University's campaign for $2.5 mil-
lion to support the Project over the next
five years.
The Ford Motor Company Fund was
incorporated in 1950 for philantrophy
in the fields of health, social welfare,
education, the humanities and scientific
research.
Orbiting Astronomical
Observatory
An orbiting astronomical observatory
satellite weighing "tens of tons" might
be preferable to a moon-based space ob-
servatory. Prof. Leo Goldberg, chairman
of The University of Michigan's Depart-
ment of Astronomy, stated this opinion
in a lecture on "Studying the Universe
from a Space Platform," part of a series
on "Peacetime Uses of Space" sponsored
by the University of California at Los
Angeles. Either the satellite or moon ob-
servatory probably could be established
within 20 years, he said.
Professor Goldberg said that, while
the moon might seem more suitable be-
cause it offers a more firm foundation
for an observatory, the absence of grav-
ity in a satellite would be a very great
advantage in achieving accurate pointing
of telescopes. A man might function bet-
ter on the moon, he continued, but "It
is also not dear that the physical pres-
ence of a man will even be necessary for
the successful operation of the (satellite)
observatory." In fact, he said, "the pres-
ence of a man in the same package with
the telescope would be a serious and
almost impossible liability to overcome,
because even the slightest movement or
shifting of weight would cause the satel-
lite and telescope to revolve and would
make accurate pointing well nigh im-
possible."
It is "perfectly feasible," Dr. Goldberg
said, "to launch a large telescope into
orbit around the earth, to point it ac-

HEART OF THE POWER-SEAT MECH-
ANISM ... Two slave units, on the left
and right sides of seat, are driven by flexi-
ble shafts to provide three-way motion.
A single !4-hp motor attached to a
geared drive unit is the power source.
Flexible shafts rotate at 1250 rpm, carry
9 in.-lbs. of torque at running load (three
persons) and 15 in.-lbs. at full stall speed.

Flexible Shafts Solve Space Problems in Chrysler Power-Seat
Chrysler Corporation faced a design challenge
in its power-operated seat adjuster. Six-way mo-
tion was called for: fore and aft, up and down,
and tilt. Yet there was limited space under the
seat for the mechanism. After much Chrysler
testing and development, a design submitted by
subcontractor Ferro Stamping Company was
approved, utilizing flexible shafts.
According to Chrysler, the decision to go to
flexible shafts was based on the following ad-
vantages:
1. SPACE ECONOMY..."flexible shafts pro-
vided means to transmit power from a single elec-
tric motor, without compromising seat design."
2. REDUCED STRESSES.. ."flexible shafts
act as torsion bars to reduce motor armature
stresses induced when the mechanism was
stopped or stalled suddenly."
3. RELIABILITY..."not a single shaft fatigue
failure reported from the field to date."
4. LOW COST..."flexible shafts definitely rep-
resented savings without sacrificing design ad-
vantages."
Investigate for yourself how flexible shafts
can solve many of your design problems and at
the same time reduce costs!

Forthcoming space exploration
will require exotic fuels and new concepts in
energy conversion to keep men alive and equip-
ment operating for long periods of time beyond
the earth's atmosphere. Advanced hydrogen sys-
tems recently developed by The Garrett Corpora-
tion have solved this problem of providing the
electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic power, plus
cooling and heating required aboard a satellite or
space capsule during launching, outer space flight
and re-entry.
Besides such spacecraft and missile systems,
other product areas in which Garrett engineers
work include small gas turbine engines, flight
data systems for air and underwater use, nuclear
and solar power systems, cryogenic systems and
THE

controls, and air conditioning and pressurization
systems for conventional aircraft and advanced
flight vehicles.
Such diversity of interest not only makes work
more interesting at Garrett, but gives the engineer
an opportunity to increase his knowledge and
chances for responsibility and advancement.
An orientation program lasting a period of
months is also available for the newly graduated
engineer, working on assignments with experi-
enced engineers in laboratory, preliminary design
and development projects. In this way his most
profitable area of interest can be found.

TECHNIC TEASERS
1) There was recently a sale of various
articles of ladies' apparel on the second
floor of a downtown department store. A
young woman and her grandmother were
rushing to get to the sale before the best
bargains were all gone. They reached the
foot of the escalator going from the first
floor to the second floor at the same time
and stepped on the first step together.
Since they were in a hurry to get to the
sale, they did not stand still and ride the
escalator up, but walked up, both at a
constant rate until they reached the top.
The young lady forgot that her grand-
mother could not keep up with her, and
walked as fast as she could. The older
woman was only able to take one step
for every three that her younger com-
panion took. Of course, when the young
woman reached the top, she had to wait
for her grandmother, so she didn't gain
anything by her rushing. The grand-
mother took 24 steps and the grand-
daughter took 36 steps. How many steps
were in sight at one time on the moving
staircase?
2) A church hymn board has four
grooved rows on which the numbers of
four hymns chosen for the service are
placed: the hymn book in use contains
700 hymns. What is the smallest number
of numbers, each carrying one digit,
which must be kept in stock so that the
numbers of any four different hymns
selected can be displayed; and how will
the result be affected if an inverted 6
can be used for a 9?
3) Once upon a time, there lived a
rich farmer who had 30 children, 15 by
his first wife, who was dead, and 15 by
his second wife. The latter woman was
eager that her eldest son should inherit
the property. Accordingly one day, she
said to him, "Dear Husband, you are
getting too old. We ought to settle who
shall be heir. Let us arrange our 30
children in a circle, and counting from
one of them, remove every tenth child
until there remains but one, who shall
succeed to your estate."
Quite astonished was the old man, as
the first 14 children eliminated were by
his first wife. Noticing this he realized
that the odds were 15 to 1 that the lat-
ter wife's children would be chosen.
"From this point on," the old man sug-
gested that they count backwards from
the lone remaining child from the de-
ceased wife. Which one became heir?
What order did they start?
4) A man is going to make a trip of
27,000 miles. His tires are guaranteed
for 12,000 miles each. What is the small-
est number of tires that he must take
(including the four tires that are on the
car) in order to make the trip? Explain.
5) There are four kegs all having
small leaks. One fills a mug in two hours,
another fills the same mug in three
hours, another in four hours, and the
remaining keg fills the mug in one
half hour. If the liquid being lost from
each keg is all funneled into the same
mug, how long will it take to fill the

the use of Boron-10 isotope in treating
a common type of brain tumor (glio-
blastoma multiforme).
Results of this therapy are so encour-
aging that Brookhaven and at least two
other institutions are constructing addi-
tional nuclear reactors used in this
therapeutic venture.
The method. In a technique known as
Neutron Capture Therapy, the patient
receives an injection of a Boron-10 com-
pound. Cancerous tissue absorbs most
of the neutrons.
In the split second that the Boron-10
becomes radioactive, it produces short-
ranged alpha particles which destroy
cancerous tissue with a minimum of
damage to healthy tissue.
Producing the isotope. The plant fur-
nishing Boron-10 to Brookhaven ordi-
narily turns out about three pounds
during a 24-hour work day. Separation
of the isotope takes place in what is
described as "the world's most efficient
fractionating system." In 350 feet of
total height, six series-connected Monel*
nickel-copper alloy columns enrich a
complex containing 18.8% Boron-10 iso-
tope to one containing 92% Boron-10.
Purification. To purify the 92% con-
centrate, a whole series of complicated
processing steps are needed . . . includ-
ing deep freeze. Columns, reboilers,
condensers, vessels, pumps, and piping
abound —each a constant challenge . . .
both to the metal and to those concerned
with equipment design and operation.
How would you meet such chal-
lenges? Some problems, of course, were
unique and demanded ingenuity of a
high order. But answers to most, 90%
or more, could be found in the vast
"experience bank" maintained by Inco
. . . some 300,000 indexed and cross-
referenced reports of metal perform-
ance under all manner of conditions.
Make a mental note: (1) that The
International Nickel Company is a rich
source of information on high-tempera-
ture and corrosion-resisting alloys; (2)

Gallium arsenide tunnel diodes like the one shown have closely controlled peak
point currents for use in computers.
portable television sets, and will be es-
pecially valuable for space satellites and
other uses where the power supply is
severely limited.
Environmental conditions have little
effect on it. It has worked at temperatures
as high as 650 degrees F., much higher
than possible with transistors. At the
other end, it can work as low as — 450
degrees F. Neutron irradiation has al-
most no effect—about one thousand times
less than the transistor—on it. It is also
unaffected by humidity.
As important as the previous facts are,
none is more important than the fact
that the tunnel diode is a quiet ampli-
fier. Only the maser and the group of
amplifiers known as parametric ampli-
fiers or junction diodes are quieter. Both
require much power, and the maser is
extremely complicated and needs liquid
helium for operation. Therefore, the
tunnel diode becomes the quietest of the
more practical amplifiers, the transistor,
vacuum tube, and the tunnel diode.
Manufacture
Manufacturing the tunnel diode is in
some ways much simpler than manufac-
turing its rival, the transistor. Transis-
tors need extremely pure crystals. Be-
cause of subsequent doping, this is un-
necessary in the tunnel diode. Also sur-
face problems, present in transistors, are
eliminated. The simple structure of the
diode makes it easy and inexpensive to
produce.
A variety of materials have been used
for the tunnel diode. Bell Labs have used
indium antimonide and RCA, gallium
arsenide. Silicon and germanium, the
materials of the transistor, have also
been used extensively.
The first tunnel diodes produced were
samples which sold for about $75 each
by General Electric. These samples ap-
peared a little over a year ago. General
Electric and Bell are now actively en-
gaged in sample production. It is hoped
that the diode will soon be cheaper to
produce than the transistor.
Many uses have been proposed for
the tunnel diode. The small radio, port-
able television, and faster computer have
already been mentioned. The diode can
be used for amplification, occilation, con-
version, limiting, detection, automatic
frequency control, gating, switching and
other functions. These abilities make the
diode very useful. It is quite probable
that it will make possible UHF televi-
sion, which would greatly increase the
number of broadcasting stations. The
problems with UHF television up to this
time has been the need for a low noise
amplifier to boost the signals which
weaken quickly after leaving the trans-
mitting equipment. With quieter ampli-
fication the UHF stations could reach a
sizeable audience which would make
them practical.
The tunnel diode will not replace older
electronic devices, the vacuum tube, the
transistor, and others, nor will it make
the newer devices, the parametric ampli-
fiers, masers, and so forth, useless. Rather
it will augment and supplement them.
For many uses the tunnel diode is ideal.
for others the other devices are better
suited. In any case, the tunnel diode is
certain to enlarge the scope of electron-
ic miracles at our fingertips.

curately at any chosen star by radio
command from the earth, and to receive
data at a ground-station, also by radio."
Furthermore, the relative closeness of a
satellite to the earth would make control
and communication easier, he pointed
out. "The role of man in the operation
of a space observatory is likely to be
limited to occasional visits to replace
worn out parts or to change equipment
attached to the telescope."
The satellite observatory would con-
tain a variety of telescopes up to perhaps
100-inches in diameter as well as one or
more radio telescopes and photometers,
spectroscopes, image tubes and radio as-
tronomy receivers. These will provide
astronomers with new and much more
accurate data, Professor Goldberg point-
ed out, because they will be out of the
earth's atmosphere which obscures and
distorts light and blocks other informa-
tion-bearing radiation from stars, plan-
ets and galaxies.
Studies made from such a platform
(Continued from page 35)
would range over nearly the entire prov-
ince of astronomy. They would include:
1. Whether there is plant life on Mars
or Venus (and prepare the way for
later space vehicle approaches and
exploration which will produce "the
most significant revelations").
2. The Sun, "both because it controls
the environment in which we live
and because it allows us to exam-
ine the anatomy of a star in very
fine detail."
3. The history and evolution of the
universe.
4. The evolution and the chemical
compositions of stars.
The moon, however, would provide
some advantages a space platform can-
not, Professor Goldberg said. The moon
could shield men from lethal solar radi-
ation, provide a rigid foundation for
radio astronomy antennas as much as a
few miles long, and block from radio
astronomy antennas man-made radio in-
terference coming from the earth by

I AM AN ENGINEER. In my profession I take pride, but without vain-
glory; to it I owe solemn obligations that I am eager to fulfill.
As an Engineer, I will participate in none but honest enterprise. To
him that has engaged my services, as employer or client, I will give the ut-
most of performance and fidelity.
When needed, my skill and knowledge shall be given without reser-
vation for the public good. From special capacity springs the obligation to
use it well in the service of humanity; and I accept the challenge that this
implies.
Jealous of the high repute of my calling, I will strive to protect the
interests and the good name of any engineer that I know to be deserving;
but I will not shrink, should duty dictate from disclosing the truth regard-
ing anyone that, by unscrupulous act, has shown himself worthy of the
profession.
Since the Age of Stone, human progress has been conditioned by the
genius of my profesional forbears. By them have been rendered usable to
mankind Nature's vast resources of material and energy. By them have
been visualized and turned to practical account the principles of science and
the revelations of technology. Except for this heritage of accumulated ex-
perience, my efforts would be feeble. I dedicate myself to the dissemina-
tion of engineering profession in all its arts and traditions.
To my fellows I pledge, in the same full measure I ask of them, in-
tegrity and fair dealing, tolerance, and respect, and devotion to the stan-
dards and the dignity of our profession; with the consciousness, always,
that our special expertness carries with it the obligation to serve humanity
with complete sincerity.

ANN ARBOR—Man can find his way
to Mars or Venus, once he has the
equipment to make the trip.
"Means of solving all technical prob-
lems associated with interplanetary navi-
gation are available today if one is will-
ing to pay a price for them," concludes
a report on a study for the Air Force
completed recently by The University of
Michigan's Willow Run Laboratories
(WRL).
The study considered basic problems
and points out areas for future research.
Several methods of navigation were
examined and the conclusion was that
problems of navigation can be solved
now if "trade-off" problems of selecting
equipment can be resolved. Then only
development of hardware would stand
in the way of man's reaching at least
the nearer planets.
It was assumed that a chemically-pro-
pelled space ship with multi-member
crew would be used.

choose careers
with. Du Pont
Every year, several hundred new college graduates choose
DuPont. Many Masters and Ph.D.'s do, too.
From time to time we learn from recent graduates the
factors which led to their decision to join this company. They
cite more than half a dozen reasons. Here are four of the most
important:
OPPORTUNITY AND RECOGNITION
They were aware that college-trained beginners
go right to work with men who have achieved.
For example, research chemists work with individuals who've
done successful research. New engineers work with pros, some of
whom have designed new plants, or devised new manufacturing
methods, or distinguished themselves in some other way. And other
graduates, with B.A. or M.B.A. degrees, go to work with leaders
who've been successful in Sales or Advertising or Treasurer's, or
another of Du Pont's many departments.
They had been told —and rightly —that DuPont rewards indi-
vidual achievement. And they were eager to start achieving.
RESEARCH CREATES NEW PRODUCTS;
NEW PRODUCTS CREATE NEW JOBS
Men like working for a company that believes in
research, enough to invest in it...$90 million a year!
The fact is that important new products come from DuPont
laboratories and go to Du Pont manufacturing plants with frequency.
Here are but a few since World War II: "Orion"* acrylic fiber
followed nylon (soon after the war). Then came "Dacron"* poly-
ester fiber, "Mylar"* polyester film, "Lucite"* acrylic lacquer and
"Delrin"* acetal resin.
These, and many others, have created thousands of new jobs... in
research, manufacturing, sales ... in fact, in all Du Pont departments.
DUPONT BACKS EMPLOYEES WITH HUGE INVESTMENT
New graduates feel that every facility is provided for doing the job well.
Last year, Du Pont's operating investment per employee was
$32,500. Since much of this was expended to provide the most
modern and best of equipment to work with, it further increases
the chance for individual achievement.
This applies to men in lab, plant and office.
DUPONT PROVIDES STEADY EMPLOYMENT
Career seekers appreciate the importance of security.
Today, the average annual turnover rate at DuPont is less
than one-third that of industry nationally.
• • •
These, and many other reasons, draw new talent to Du Pont each year.
Prospective graduates, M.S.'s and Ph.D.'s interested in learning
more about job opportunities at Du Pont are urged to see their Place-
ment Counselor, or to write direct to E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.
(Inc.). They should tell us the course they are majoring in so we can
send literature that is most appropriate.

space navigation will involve finding
and following the best curve to other
planets.
Because early phases of the flight
would be worked out by earth-bound
computers, the WRL report concentrates
on extra-planetary phases. Complexity
of the problem makes selection of a
single technique nearly impossible, it
points out.
Earlier investigations had centered
around a pre-computed elliptical orbit to
Mars. But using pre-computed orbits,
the report states, requires extreme accur-
acy, and knowing just where you are and
where you should be at any given time
on the trip. Presently, however, finding
celestial distances and one's velocity in
space would not be easy.
The best presently-known way to de-
termine speed is to find where you were,
where you are, and how long it took to
go between the two points. Currently,
optical angle-measuring techniques—sim-
ilar to those used by Columbus—com-
bined with extremely accurate clocks
EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
(Continued from page 46)
seem best for this. But such equipment
is heavy and would boost fuel require-
ments.
A subsequent study by the Willow
Run group suggests alternative methods
which would require far less equipment
and simplify the navigator's job.
One alternative assumes ionic propul-
sion would be used. Building an ionic
rocket is now close enough to feasibility
to warrant consideration, WRL scien-
tists believe.
An ion engine electronically expels
bits of molecules (ions) at higher speeds
than the chemical rocket can expel whole
molecules by heat-expansion alone. The
ionic engine can reach higher speeds in
space but doesn't produce enough thrust
for launching.
Ionic propulsion would give the navi-
gator continuous steering control.
With such control, "homing" tech-
niques—guiding the ship on a charac-
teristic of the target—are attractive and
worthy of further study.
Two examples of such techniques are
cited: 1) The ship would travel a line
formed by the sun and Mars, always
moving away from the sun, to eventually
reach Mars; 2) The navigator would
stay on a line formed by Mars and a
"reference" star far enough away so
lines from the star to any point on Mars'
orbit always seems parallel. Again, con-
tinuing away from the sun and maintain-
ing this bearing would eventually put
the ship at Mars.
In either case the "homing" would
eliminate the need to keep careful checks
of time, velocity, orbit, or position in
space for navigational purposes.
The Countermeasures Department at
WRL directed the project, assisted by
WRL's Special Projects Group and Com-
putation Department and the U-M De-
partments of Astronomy and Mathemat-
ics.

steering spindle

By designing front-end spindles to be forged, automobile and truck
manufacturers practically eliminate danger of failure of these vital parts, even
under sudden turning stress that can reach thousands of foot-pounds.
Start your designs by planning to use forgings everywhere there's a high
degree of stress, vibration, shock, or wear. Forged parts withstand them all better
than parts made by other fabrication methods. And forgings have no hidden
voids to be uncovered after costly machining hours have been invested
. . . the hammer blows or high pressures of the forging process
compact the better forging metal, make it even better.
Write for literature on the design, specification,

A young man in a cocktail lounge
saw a blonde sitting at a table nearby
and was struck by her extraordinary
beauty. In fact, he decided he had never
seen such a gorgeous girl. And, almost
before he realized what he was doing,
he got up, went over to her and asked
her to dance. She consented and soon
he found she was not only beautiful,
but she danced divinely.
When the music stopped, he sat with
her and they had a drink. To his amaze-
ment, she turned out to be a brilliant
conversationalist. And he thought to
himself, "here at last is THE woman."
Unable to contain himself any longer,
he asked if he might take her home. She
smiled and said, "yes."
When the taxi stopped, it was in front
of one of New York's most elegant
apartment hotels, and the young man
pinched himself to see if he were not
dreaming—a beautiful, brilliant, amiable
girl, and rich, too.
He walked on air beside her as they
proceeded down the richly carpeted
hallway. She put her gold key in the
lock, opened the door and they went
into her apartment. When she snapped
on the light, the young man stared.
There, in the center of the room, lay a
dead horse.
Noticing his gasp of amazement, the
girl spoke: "I didn't say I was neat,
did I?"
Friend: "I thought you expected to be
out of the hospital last week?"
Patient: "I did, but complications
set in—my wife caught me kissing the
nurse."

At a party recently a professor felt
that he had partaken rather freely of the
champagne and was determined to be
careful and avoid any of the usual signs
of tipsiness.
When they arose from the table, some-
one suggested that the hostess exhibit
the latest addition to her family. She
agreed and presently a nurse appeared
with a dainty pink basket containing
twins.
The prof was nearest, and, mindful of
his determination he steadied and said, as
he gazed into the basket: "What a beau-
tiful baby."
A wealthy Detroiter, returning from
his grand tour abroad, was asked by an
artistic friend whether he had managed
to pick up a Van Gogh or Picasso abroad.
"Naw," said the traveler. "They're all
left-hand drive over there and besides I
got three Buicks anyway."
An aging farmer who had little pa-
tience with prankish children finally suc-
cumbed to the wiles of his young and
attractive housekeeper, the mother of a
seven-year-old brat. Soon after the mar-
riage she took off for the big city to do
some personal shopping. Upon her return
some days later she asked her son how he
got along with his new father.
"Just fine," exclaimed the boy.
"Every morning he took me out on
the lake in a rowboat and let me swim
back."
"Heavens—isn't that a long distance
for you to swim?" his mother gasped.
"Oh, I made it all right," said the
boy.
During a grouse hunt one sportsman
was shooting at a clump of trees near
a stone wall. Suddenly an angry face
popped over the top of the wall. "Curse
you, you almost hit my wife!"
"Did I?" cried the man, "I'm terribly
sorry—have a shot at mine over there."
Scene: A lonely corner on a dark
night.
A voice: "Would the gentleman be so
kind as to assist a poor hungry fellow
who is out of work? Besides this re-
volver, I haven't a thing in the world."
The thrifty Scotsman asked the bank
for a loan of a dollar and was told he
must pay four per cent interest at the
end of the year.
"That's four cents?" asked the Scots-
man.
"Do you have any security?" asked
the banker.
"I do. Fifty thousand dollars in U.S.
bonds."
The bank accepted the bonds and gave
him the dollar. At the end of a year,
the Scotsman came back with a dollar
and four cents to clear up his debt and
asked for his fifty thousand in bonds
back.
As he returned the bonds, the banker
asked, "I don't want to be personal, but
if you have all these bonds, why did you
have to borrow a dollar?"
"Well," replied the Scotsman, "do
you know any other way I can get a
safety deposit vault for four cents a
year?"
There are only two kinds of parking
left on the campus—illegal and no.
A Midwestern university held entrance
exams for a group of former GI's. One
question was "Name two ancient sports."
A former sergeant racked his brain,
finally came up with an answer that
passed him. He wrote "Anthony and
Cleopatra."

An officer, home from strenuous serv-
ice overseas, was assigned to a desk job
in the Pentagon building. Each day for
a week he shifted location of his desk—
and finally wound up in the men's wash
room.
"Must be shell-shocked," associates de-
cided.
But the officer explained grimly, "It's
the only place around here where people
seem to know what they are doing."

growth that can be
important to your future career
Did you know that the chemical industry has grown at a rate of about
10% per year since 1929, as compared with only 3% for the econ-
omy as a whole? It's a fact! And there's every reason to believe that
this favorable growth rate will continue.
For the graduating chemist or chemical engineer, this spells oppor-
tunity. Opportunity to grow with a growing industry.
Allied Chemical, for example, now produces more than 3,000 diver-
sified chemicals at over 100 plants throughout the country. Many of
these products are basic—used in volume by almost every industry.
Allied is at the heart of the nation's economy and looks forward
to continued growth and stability.
Ask our interviewer about career opportunities at Allied when he
next visits your campus. Your placement office can give you the date
and supply you with a copy of "Your Future in Allied Chemical."

their Earth-to-Mars timetable, according
to a University of Michigan report to
the Air Force on interplanetary naviga-
tion.
The two types of time are: "Reference
to astronomical time for example, the
time of day and reference to some event
during the course of the flight," which
may take more than a year.
Space pilots, accordingly, will need
an extremely accurate, compact, and de-
pendable timepiece, calibrated in micro-
seconds for computations, but also able
to tell the human crew the passage of
hours, days, months.
For the astronauts will have much
time on their hands, out in weightless
space.
During the mid-course phase," the re-
port suggests, "days or even weeks may
be available for navigational computa-
tion." When the first manned space ship
nears Mars, however, split-second deci-
sions will have to be made to orbit in
for a safe landing.
Pioneer astronauts, at least, won't have
to worry about the "Einstein effect." The
(Continued from page 48)
father of relativity predicted that clocks
on interstellar space ships would "slow
down," and that passengers would age
less than if they spent the equivalent time
on earth.
No chance of this on the first Mars
launch. A clock would have to zoom
through space close to the speed of light,
186,000 miles a second, to slow down
significantly, according to Einstein. On
the way to Mars, the crew will travel
sedately at only about 20 miles a second.
Cell Research
ANN ARBOR — Living cells, like
computers, have built-in feedback" mech-
anisms which help control their activi-
ties, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist de-
clared March 8 at The University of
Michigan.
Sir Hans Krebs of Oxford University,
England, addressed an overflow audience
of 600 students and faculty at an Insti-
tute of Science and Technology lecture.
Recent research suggest that cellular
growth and destruction are cyclical in
nature, he declared. The steps involved
in synthesis of living matter are basic-
ally different from those involved in its
decomposition. Previously, the two were
regarded as a single, reversible process.
For example, he noted most ce!ls have
the ability to make far more of their
constituent parts than they actually need.
If a particular component is in short
supply, the cell will go "all out" to try
and produce it. But once its needs are
satisfied, the cell will tend to restrict
further activity of the same sort.
Like the driver of a car, the cell will
use its metabolic machinery only when
it needs to, keeping lots of "power" in
reserve. In this way, the cell works to
maintain a fairly stable balance in its
activity, much as a driver might do in
maintaining a steady rate of speed over
a hilly highway.
In both the cell and man, he conclud-
ed, hormones and the central nervous
system play important parts in helping
maintain overall balance in the rate of
metabolic activity in different tissues.

mysterious quantity which bridges the realms of
science and philosophy, and which may contain the
key to the problem of creation.
The Power of Mathematics. How mathematics works
for us tc make otherwise unsolvable problems simple.
The Case for Theory. An answer to the often-heard

Take advantage of the

ADVANTAGE
The screw is a combination of two
mechanical principles: the lever,
and the inclined plane in helical
form. The leverage applied to the
nut combines with motion of the nut
around the bolt to exert tremendous
clamping force between the two.
One of the greatest design errors
today, in fact, is failure to realize
the mechanical advantages that
exist in standard nuts and bolts.
Smaller diameters and less costly
grades of fasteners tightened to
their full capacity will create far
stronger joints than those utilizing
bigger and stronger fasteners tight-
ened to only a fraction of their
capacity. Last year, one of our engi-
neers showed a manufacturer how
he could save $97,000 a year simply
by using all the mechanical advan-
tages of a less expensive grade.
When you graduate, make sure
you consider the mechanical advan-
tages that RBaW fasteners provide.
And make sure, too, that you con-
sider the career advantages RB&amp;W
offers mechanical engineers—in the
design, manufacture and application
of mechanical fasteners. If you're

George called his home to talk to his
wife. The phone rang and rang—and
finally the little woman answered it. "Oh,
dear," she moaned, "you got me out of
the rub. Please call back in 20 minutes.
I'm dripping wet and I didn't even have
a chance to grab a towel, trying to get
to the phone."
George said okay and hung up. Then
he redialed his phone number, hurriedly
whispering instructions to one of his
pals in the office.
The pal took the phone. Again the
wife—who couldn't have had time to
get back to the tub—answered with a
rather annoyed, "Yes?"
The pal said, "Is George ho ...

An engineer of a large instrument
company was looking over drawings and

had been ordered by one of the firm's
largest clients. Attached to the paper
were the coded instructions, "MILTDD-

ignations, the engineer looked in his
technical journals, but was unable to
find them. Finally he placed a long-dis-
tance call to the customer.
"Would you mind telling me what
'MILTDD-41' means?" he asked .
"Sure, I'll tell you," the customer

said. "It means, 'Make it like the damned

introduced into a man's food to lessen
his natural emotions. Here's a prescrip-
tion; get some of this and put it into
some cookies or candy, then send it to
him and see what happens." The wife
got the chemical and, wishing to be
certain, put a triple dose of it into
some cookies, which she sent to her hus-
band. She didn't get another letter from
him for seven months. When a letter
finally arrived, she opened it hurriedly
with trembling fingers. The letter began:

The electron microscope (left) is used for investigations of the structure of materials, such
as asbestos (right). The knowledge of the structure of materials is important in understand-
ing their properties. These control the applications and design of materials. The most ad-
vanced mechanisms in use today are critically dependent on the microscopic structure of
materials. Improved utilization of present materials and the discovery of new ones will
permit breakthroughs in the fields of mechanisms, communications, space exploration, and
maximum utilization of energy.
The Engineering Materials curriculum of the niversity of Michigan is designed to train

The most hopelessly futile attempts at controlling
student functions on the campus of the University of
Michigan by the same sort of universal democracy as is
used in managing the affairs of our national govern-
ment has finally instituted demands for a new deal. From
all sides of the campus the barbs have been levelled
rather justly on that utterly useless group of boy politicians
called the Student {Government) Council and agitation has
finally reached a serious enough vein to threaten the life
of this body. But the question is probably arising in many
serious students' thoughts as to whether the dropping of
the Student Council and the turning over of its few
meager functions to the Union will entirely solve the
problem. The real nature of the attack has not changed
much through the last several years and is actually not a
specific charge against any specific organization such as
the Student (Government) Council or Engineering Council
itself. The outcry is the wholly justified one against the
entire unwholesome setup of student politics. In past years,
its clear voice, raised above the muddled babblings of
so-called student leaders, has brought about a divorce of
the Union and the publication boards from the political
jamboree. But there is more to be done now before it is
stilled for good.
As one well known professor rather appropriately puts
it, "It has been interesting to be on the outside looking in
and watching the children playing about with the deceits
and treacheries of the really grown up political world.
But, frankly, it is more damaging to their later usefullness
as good citizens than anything we could allow them to do
for it destroys every bit of their respect for public office."
It is very soundly asserted that the most able men in the
country do not hold political office and would not con-
sider entering politics under present characteristics. And
it is just as true and much more easily proven that those
organizations and activities which are carried on under
student election principles have always been the weakest
and most mis-managed on the campus. A good cleanup
seems imperative, does it not?
Class elections are the great farce comedy of the fall
term. Whoever heard of a class organizing and doing
anything? It has become so bad that it's almost a sacrilege
to speak of such a thing. Class officers cost money to elect,
to keep, and to publicize enough to satisfy their vanities.
Dues are assessed to try and cover this but the wary stu-
dent has finally come to want something for his dollars
and never pays. So why in the world should we keep them?
Let's pull down the curtain on the last act and close the
comedy for keeps.
The Student {Government) Council, the Engineering
Council, and those few other committees and organizations
which are filled by student voting have long ago ceased to
accomplish enough to justify their further existences. It
has already been suggested that the few duties of the
Student (Government) Council could well be taken care of
by the Union by expanding its personnel somewhat and
this view should certainly be approved. The Union is
admirably suited to handle the routine duties of student
self government. Its members are all working for advance-
ment under merit system rules, are not connected with
political machinations in the least, and are thus likely to
be able, hard working, and conscientious. And it is just
as reasonable to suppose that a proper organization of this
committee would enable it to handle all the details of
student self-government now distributed among several
groups, rotting away under the politician's touch.
Politics on this campus with its resultant evils of
student over-organization and inefficiency must ultimately
go if the ideals of a successful student self-government
are to be realized. As long as student offices are to be
created solely for the satisfaction of personal vanities and
over-inflated egos and for the collection of as much graft
as is possible and are to be filled by the office juggling
childishness of psuedo politicians and B.M.O.C.'s in name
but not in deed, the disadvantages of student self-govern-
ment will far outweigh its advantages. We can only hope
that the agitation which has been lately aroused will
gather an increment so strong that it will ultimately banish
the whole machinery of student politics and cut down the
number of "ego" pages in the yearly Michiganensian.
Anyway its an idea worth backing.

ENGINEERS
A number of recent events—the emergence of several new
nations during the past year, the Congo crisis, the presidential
campaign—have focused the attention of the world on the devel-
oping countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Out of this attention has come the realization by many people
that these emerging nations are almost wholely lacking in the
facilities, resources, and personnel to develop at more than a pitiful-
ly slow rate. The Congo is a good example of such a situation.
In this country of millions there are less than 100 trained citizens
to handle the administration of the government, law enforcement,
public health, and the schools. In this type of situation it is vir-
tually impossible to think about doctors, engineers, technicians,
lawyers, labor experts, and agricultural specialists. Our understand-
ing of the complexity of this problem is heightened immeasurably
when we contrast it with what has become known as "the American
way of life and standard of living."
Out of this concern, with the impetus of speeches by President
Kennedy and Chester Bowles here at the University, has come the
formation of a group of students at Michigan dedicated to the
purpose of urging the United States and/or the United Nations
to develop
large-scale programs (that) would send young, capable
teachers, doctors, engineers and the like to the developing
countries of the world that ask for our assistance.
It is because of the integral part that engineers would play in such
a program that we feel it is important to discuss this subject here.
It is not our intent to simply describe this movement, the Americans
Committed to World Responsibility, which the local group of stu-
dents started and are helping to establish on campuses across the
nation. What is more important is why such an organization exists,
what its goals are, and how these goals affect us as engineers.
First of all, we have discussed the situation that exists in thest
developing countries. Many of them are living under what we
would term sixteenth and seventeenth century conditions. The prob-
lem is that we live in the twentieth century. From this we con-
clude that there should be no doubt in our minds that these people
need outside help, most of which must come from the United
States. We speak not from the materialistic standpoint that if we
don't the Communists will. We agree that this is important but
more important is our moral obligation as a prosperous, democratic
nation to help these developing nations in their formative years.
It is our obligation to help reduce the almost endless number of
years of growth before they will be able to stand, unaided, in the
brotherhood of nations.
For many years we, as a nation, have supported this type ot
view. Now, however, we have a movement of students sweeping
across this campus and the nation who are willing to accept this
obligation as individuals, who are willing to contribute their talent
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and ACWR
and lives for several years in order to make the world a better
place by serving in these needy nations, who are willing to sacri-
fice part of their lives for the cause of peace.
Today there is very little opportunity for the realization of
these goals. Support by President Kennedy of this movement, prin-
cipally in his speech suggesting a United States Peace Corp and in
conversations with the leaders of ACWR, indicates that within a few
months the opportunity to individually accept world responsibility
may be available. And this brings us to the final point—what does
this mean to us as engineers? In part we have already answered that
question. There should be no doubt that—along with doctors,
agricultural experts, public health personnel, teachers, and admin-
istrators—engineers are needed in these developing nations. The
final portion of the answer must come from each of us individually.
It may appear that the question is whether we can afford to
forego certain economic and professional advantages by participating
in such a program. However, we feel that the basic question which is
most important in the long run is: Is a temporary personal sacrifice
worth a personal contribution to a better world? Only we can decide
this issue ourselves. Only we as individuals can commit our-
selves to world responsibility.
If you feel that this idea, this movement, is important and are
interested in learning more about or lending your support to it, we
here at the Technic office would appreciate hearing from you.

Prior to recent S.G.C. elections, Hectorians—the fraternity
honorary—publicly supported several candidates for the Council.
This has been a standard procedure of Hectorians in recent years.
We are very pleased to see the group support Mary Wheeler,
president of the local NAACP. There is no doubt that Hectorians
based their selections solely on the individuals and their views on
the issues rather than on race, religion or sex. In our thinking this
action went a long way in changing the public image of the fra-
ternity system. We hope this indicates a changing attitude within
the fraternity system itself.
For several years a few of the local technical societies have been
sponsoring weekly noon luncheons followed by short but inter-
esting programs. Last spring another group, the ASME, adopted
this idea. We would like to see more societies do the same. After
attending several of these noon sessions we can say that the meal
was good, the speakers interesting, and it did not cut into study
time as evening sessions of these groups do.

or a marketing man, when he chooses the chemical industry
for his career he singles himself out as an individual. This is

Dow, teamwork has its place, but it is recognized, too, that

room for ideas than a chemical company. In the first place,
new chemicals, most of them never before existent at all,
are made at an astounding rate. If the chemical is made for
a specific job, then at least one application is known for it.
But many others are the result of pure research or are

A CASE FOR THEORY
"Ah, this could be a good course, but that guy doesn't
teach anything but theory! Why doesn't he give us something
practical, something that we can use?"
How many times have you heard this complaint as you
walked out of a classroom? How many times have you ut-
tered similar sentiments yourself? Possibly frequently. At any
rate, it's very likely that such words are not unfamiliar gripes
to you, unless you are one of the few engineers enrolled in a
curriculum where basic theory is the expected thing. Our so-
called "T-schedule" engineers have an ingrained reluctance
to consider anything not immediately useful or practical to
them as really worth their valuable time.
But why do so many instructors throw the graphs and the
handbooks out the window and resort to developing formulas
and stating hypotheses in the engineering classroom? Why
have special programs been developed which emphasize basic
fundamentals rather than the past and present applications
of these fundamentals? Is it possible that there is, indeed, a
sound, down-to-earth, practical reason why engineers should
have their noggins crammed full of "impractical" theory?
I believe so. Further, I believe that there are an overpow-
ering number of reasons why this is so. This issue of the
Tecbnic is primarily devoted to a discussion of just a few of
these theories and their significance. Therefore, it is appro-
priate to "kick off" this issue with a brief discussion of why
these "hairy beasts" of engineering science can and should
be domesticated to become our "beasts of burden."
The first reason for studying theory is that it is interesting.
"Truth is stranger than fiction," and scientific theory is truth
in its most primoridal form. Theory is always more interest-
ing than the somewhat dry conclusions and applications that
can be amassed by "plugging in to it."
Perhaps it requires a little more mental effort to really
comprehend something that is a bit abstract. Possibly it is
more difficult to understand a theory than to memorize an
equation or to recall a faint. But, once understood, a theory
will fascinate the imagination to a degree that it will be
forgotten with difficulty.
Next, theory gives us an insight into realms that are often
far removed from the engineering conclusions that are drawn
from it. In this respect, a study of theory will make us some-

thing more than engineers. For example, a study of the
theory of entrophy will lead us into some very interesting
philosophical ramifications that might never occur to us if
we understand entropy merely as the integral of d 0 over T.
Further, theory will permit us to draw an infinite number
of conclusions instead of the finite number of conclusions
which we can have at our fingertips if we study only the con-
clusions. As a very simple example, knowing how to integrate
gives us a great deal more flexibility in performing mathe-
matical operations than we will have if we restrict our inter-
est in the subject to the rote memorization of a table of
integrals.
Akin to this is the ever-increasing difficulty of carrying in
mind all the necessary facts for the solution of problems in
a given engineering field. A chemical engineer cannot prac-
tice successfully merely by stringing together a sequence of
reactions and other operations in his pilot plant. He must be
able to predict what will happen to various substances in the
presence of heat, reagents, catalysts, etc. This entails the
memorization of a basic list of properties of common sub-
stances, but also demands the ability to predict on the basis
of a sound theoretical background whether his present prob-
lem will also behave as experience might indicate.
This leads to the final, and perhaps most important, reason
for having a background in theory:' one can never make a
new contribution to science or engineering if he restricts his
thought and imagination to presently-held techniques and
concepts. In order to make advances that are not mere adap-
tations or rehashes of already-familiar techniques or problem-
solutions, it is necessary to resort to the basic natural laws
upon which engineering techniques are developed. (Devel-
opment of new engineering techniques must always be con-
sidered as an appropriate field for the engineer as well as the
pure scientist.) Indeed, it is often helpful to question the
truth of the theory itself, and to overturn an inadequate
theory in favor of one containing a greater degree of truth.
This is the scientific method; increasingly it is destined to
become the engineering method. But how can one overturn
a theory if one knows it not?
Let's have a little less griping if the Prof, wants to teach
the fundamentals of his discipline rather than the formulae
and data that can always be gleaned from a handbook!


SIGNIFICANCE
ENTROPY?
Entropy's mysteries are brushed away in this
broad discussion of a much - misunderstood,
often-misused term.
by PROF. GORDEN J. VAN WYLEN
Entropy! For many students in intro-
ductory thermodynamics and physi-
cal chemistry—and even philosophy—
the term has a mysterious aspect. Even
though some facility may have been
gained in solving problems involving en-
tropy, a thorough and basic understand-
ing of entropy is often lacking. The true
university student, however, is anxious
to push beyond superficial knowledge
and gain an insight into trie basis and
significance of entropy. The purpose of
this article is, within the limits of the
author, to aid such students in their
"pursuit of entropy" and to show its
relevance to many areas of life.
The concept of entropy is based on the
Second Law of Thermodynamics, the be-
ginnings of which were first set forth by
Carnot in 1824. In the following four
decades the Second Law was clarified,
from a classical point of view, by several
scientists, the leading contributors being
Kelvin and Clausius. It was the latter
who first introduced the term entropy.
Later the microscopic or statistical ap-
proach to the Second Law was developed,
primarily by Doltzmann, Gibbs, and Max-
well. Let us first, therefore, briefly con-
sider the Second Law of Thermody-
As in the case of all scientific laws,
the Second Law of Thermodynamics is
in essence a description or systematiza-
tion of observed facts. For purposes of
this paper let us consider the Second Law
as it applies to an isolated system. An iso-
lated system is a quantity of matter which
has no interactions or transfer of mass
or energy with the surroundings. For an
isolated system only certain changes of
state are possible. For example, suppose
the isolated system consists of a spinning
disc in a container. The disc might pos-
sibly retain its given angular velocity,
but in the long run we would expect it
to slow down. It certainly will not speed
up. Or consider a storage battery. The
"charge" in the battery will probably
decrease with time, or in the limit remain
constant, but certainly it will not increase
in "charge" while sitting on the shelf.
Every macroscopic process which we
know, be it heat transfer, chemical reac-
tion, mechanical motion, or other process,
has associated with it certain irreversibili-
ties. This means that if an isolated sys-
tem undergoes a process which has an ir-
reversibility associated with it, it can
never be restored to its former state, with-
out violation of its isolation. Even though
an ideal process, which is called a re-
versible process, can be visualized, it is
never achieved in practice. The best
conceivable process is a reversible one,
and in one sense the work of an engineer
is to approach as closely as possible to a
reversible process, consistent with eco-
nomic considerations.
In the examples cited above, the disc
continuing to rotate at constant angular
velocity would be a reversible process,
and the slowing down would be an irre-
versible process. Similarly, the decrease
in "charge" of the battery would be due
to irreversibilities, and the maintaining
of a constant charge would be a rever-
sible process (or perhaps more accurately,
no process at all). The Second Law of
Thermodynamics states that only rever-
sible or irreversible processes will occur
in an isolated system. There are many
conceivable processes which simply will
not occur, and this is stated by the Sec-
ond Law.
The term entropy is used to give quan-
titative expression to the Second Law.
The greater the irreversibility in a pro-
cess which the isolated system may expe-
rience, the greater its gain in entropy.
For a reversible process the change in
entropy of the isolated system is zero.
Thus the isolated system will undergo
16

entropy increases or, in the limit, remains
at its initial value. It cannot undergo a
change of state which would result in a
decrease in its entropy.
From a microscopic point of view the
Second Law can be thought of in terms
of a transition from less probable to more
probable states. Entropy can be conceived
of as the logarithm of the probability of
being in a given state. Thus if W2 repre-
sents the probability of the second state
(the more probable state) and Wx that of
the initial or less probable state, the in-
crease of entropy would be:
W2
S2 - Sl = log — .
Since W, &gt; W„ the increase in entropy
is positive as the system undergoes the
change from the less probable to the
more probable state. Two equally prob-
able states would have the same entropy.
Slightly more than fifty years ago
Nernst formulated his "New Heat The-
orem," which he subsequently referred
to as the Third Law of Thermodynamics.
Although this law was challenged for a
considerable period, it has won an estab-
lished place as a fundamental law of
science. This law asserts that for a sys-
tem in thermodynamic equilibrium at
the absolute zero of temperature, the
entropy of all components is less than all
other states. The entropy therefore is
assumed to be zero in this equilibrium
state at the absolute zero and absolute
entropies are measured relative to this
base. The two main methods used to
measure absolute entropy are the calori-
metric method and the spectroscopic
method. The former method involves
cooling the substance to less than 1°K
and carefully measuring the heat capacity
as a function of temperature. Professor
Edgar Westrum of the Chemistry Depart-
ment of The University of Michigan has
an excellent laboratory for this purpose.
The second method involves a determina-
tion of the fundamental frequence of vi-
bration, the moments of inertia, and the
symmetry number of a molecule from
spectroscopic data, and a calculation of
the absolute entropy from the formulae
of statistical mechanics. When thermo-
dynamics is applied to chemical reac-
tions, the absolute entropy plays an im-
portant role, particularly as regards chem-
ical equilibrium.
Let us now proceed to discuss the con-
sequences of the Second Law to a num-
ber of different areas.
1. First let us consider the relation be-
tween entropy and time. Entropy has been
called "time's arrow," for the direction
of time, as time goes from past to pres-
ent to future, is associated with an in-
crease of entropy. We are in effect on a
one way street. We might stop for awhile,
but every movement carries us in a cer-
tain direction—the direction of the in-
crease of entropy. The passing of time
is thus related to an increase of entropy.
If time could be reversed after an irre-
versible process takes place in an isolated
system, a decrease in entropy would re-
sult, and this we know to be impossible
on the basis of the Second Law. Thus,
time and the increase in entropy of a
closed system are inseparably linked.
2. The second thing to note is that the
Second Law does not tell us anything
about how fast the entropy will increase.
A container filled with oxygen and hy-
drogen might exist for a year with no
significant change of state and hence no
increase of entropy. Yet within a mo-
ment after a spark is introduced in the
mixture a tremendous increase in en-
tropy takes place. The Second Law gives
no information on the rate of increase of
entropy; this is determined by various
factors in the given situation. Thus a
catalyst may be used to promote the in-
crease of entropy. The freezing and pres-
ervation of foods are a sort of "negative
catalyst" which serves to slow down the
rate of increase of entropy.
3. The question naturally arises as re-
gards the consequences of the Second
Law as applied to the universe. Does
the Second Law apply to the universe?
Can the universe be considered as an
isolated system? If it does apply, how
did the universe get in the state of low
entropy and what is the future of the
universe?
First of all, we must be careful to note,
as stated previously, that a scientific law
does not come to us as a decree from a
supreme being, but simply represents a
systematization of observed results from
many experiments. As such it applies only
to the range of experimentation, and
cannot necessarily be extrapolated beyond
this. For example, classical mechanics
was a very well established theory, but
did not apply to fast particles. Relativity
was necessary to explain these phe-
nomena.
So the question arises, what is the
domain of applicability of the second
law? Basically it applies to an isolated
system. When we apply it to a non-iso-
lated system we do so by considering
both the non-isolated system and its sur-
roundings and this still implies an iso-
lated system. The earth is not an isolated
system, for it continually receives radia-
tion from the sun and through cosmic
rays, and energy is in turn radiated from
the earth. Every evidence would indicate
that the Second Law of Thermodynam-
ics could be applied to this process, but
no accurate measurements have been
made. But what about the universe as a
whole? Is it an isolated system or not?
Is it finite or not? Where are its boun-
daries and what are their nature? We
know it is expanding, but what are the
consequences of this as far as the Sec-
ond Law is concerned?
Obviously, we can give no conclusive
answers to these questions on the basis
of the Second Law. Personally, I have
come to the conclusion (primarily on the

OF RELATIVITY
The implications of the familiar e = mc2 equa-
tion are reviewed for the beginner, with a few
notes on the meaning of relativity in our every-
day activities.
By IRVING SALMEEN
One of the greatest physical theories
presented during the twentieth
century was the theory of relativity. Deal-
ing with the basic constitutes of the uni-
verse—mass, length, and time—the the-
ory accounts for various discrepancies of
Newtonian mechanics. The fundamen-
tals of relativity related, for the first time,
the basic entities of matter. Introduced
by Albert Einstein in 1905, it has had a
profound influence on physical and in-
tellectual advancement of man.
The basic ideas of relativity begin with
the concepts of Galilean or Newtonian
relativity. Essentially the Galilean prin-
ciple states: if the laws of mechanics are
valid in one coordinate system (a coor-
dinate system being simply a frame of
reference), then they are valid in any
other coordinate system moving uni-
formly relative to the first. If two coor-
dinate systems are moving non-uniformly
relative to each other, then the laws of
mechanics cannot be valid in both. Coor-
dinate systems in which the laws of me-
chanics are valid are called inertial
systems.
Relative Coordinate Systems
Consider the law of inertia: every
body remains in its state of rest or uni-
form motion in a straight line unless it
is acted on by an external force. Now
imagine an experimenter who believes
that the law of inertia can be proved or
disproved by actual experiment. He con-
ducts his tests in a windowless room with
no communication with the outside world.
His test consists of pushing small spheres
along a horizontal table attempting to
eliminate friction which acts as the out-
side force. He notices that as friction is
reduced the motion of the spheres be-
comes more uniform. Just as he is about
to proclaim the principle of inertia, a
practical joker installs some mechanism
which enables him to cause the entire
room to rotate quickly on an axis pass-
ing through the center of the room.
When the rotation begins the experi-
menter undergoes new and unexpected
experiences. The sphere which had been
moving uniformly tries to get as far
away from the center and as near the
walls of the room as possible. The ex-
perimenter feels a strange force pushing
him against the wall. He experiences the
same sensation as anyone in a train or
car traveling fast around a curve. All his
previous results go to pieces.
The physicist would have to discard,
with the law of inertia, all mechanical
laws. The law of inertia was his starting
point; if this is changed so are all his
further conclusions. An observer des-
tined to spend his whole life in the ro-
tating room and to perform all his exper-
iments there would have laws of mechan-
ics differing from ours. If, on the other
hand, he enters the room with a profound
knowledge of mechanics and a firm be-
lief in the principles of physics, his ex-
planation for the apparent breakdown
of mechanics would be the assumption
that the room rotates. By mechanical
experiments he could even ascertain how
it rotates.1
From this it is easy to see that the
description of physical events depends
upon the coordinate system. For the ex-
perimenter inside of the room, the room
was his coordinate system and all events
as he observed them had to be explained
in terms of his coordinate system. In his
system, the laws of mechanics were not
valid. On the other hand, an observer
walking into the room could explain per-
fectly well the strange behavior of the
objects in the room because relative to
his coordinate system the room was ro-
tating, which accounted for the different
behavior. The laws of mechanics are able
to explain the behavior induced by the
rotation, therefore it is apparent that
the laws of mechanics are valid in both
coordinate systems.
Michelson-Morley Experiment
The Galilean relativity principle is

shown to be valid for all inertial coordi-
nate systems moving relative to one an-
other, but the question arises whether or
not it is valid for nonmechanical sys-
tems. One example of such a non-me-
chanical system is the propagation of
light. For years the idea was held that
light waves were transmitted in a medium
called ether, but in 1881 Albert Michel-
son aided by Morley undertook an exper-
iment to determine the existence of ether.
The results of the experiment showed
two things: first that ether did not exist,
and second that the velocity of light was
constant and independent of any coordi-
nate system. Working from the results
of this experiment Einstein proceeded
to make some startling deductions.
Fallacy in the Addition of Velocities
Consider the mechanical law of addi-
tion of velocities. A train is moving uni-
formly at a velocity v relative to the
earth. At a point Q the train passes a
flasher. Now imagine an observer in the
train looking at the flasher. To the ob-
server the velocity of light should be
v + c as the train moves toward the flash-
er and v — c as the train moves away.
But the Michelson experiment showed
that the velocity of light should be sim-
ply c or 186,000 miles per second. At
this point one of two things had to be
wrong: either that c was not constant, or
that the addition of velocities was not
valid.
Here Einstein stepped in. It had been
proven that c was constant and the vel-
ocity addition was as fundamental as
2 + 2 = 4. Rather than attempting to say-
that either was wrong, Einstein sought a
transformation equation that would re-
late the two systems and still satisfy the
conditions of light. Such equations had
been already developed by H. A. Lor-
entz and were known as the Lorentz
transformation equations. Consider again
the train moving uniformly down the
track.
This time the train is moving from a
point B to a point A. At point D, one
half way between A and B, is positioned
an observer, and at point E, on top of
the train, is a second observer. Each has
an arrangement of mirrors placed so that
he can observe a flash of light at points
A and B without moving his eyes. As the
train moves to the point where E and D
are opposite, lightning flashes at the pre-
cise same instant at A and B. To the
observer at D, the flashes will be simul-
taneous but to C they will not be, be-
cause the train is moving away from B,
hence the light has farther to go from
point B than from point A. If the train
could have a velocity equal to the speed
of light, then the light from B would
never reach E and E would only see one
flash. From this we can see that a simul-
taneous event depends on the coordinate
system. To one the flashes are simulta-
neous, to the other they are not. This il-
lustrates that one can not say "now"' and
assume it holds for all of the universe.
Some transformation must be made to
relate all systems in the universe.
The fallacy of the addition of veloci-
ties lies in the assumption that the dura-
tion of an event is independent of the
state of motion of the system of refer-
ence. But Einstein showed that to de-
scribe any phenomena of nature in con-
sistent terms for all systems, one must
regard time and velocity as variables.
The Lorentz transformations accomplish
this task.

MATHEMATICS
We all know that math can perform literal mir-
acles in solving problems, but exactly what
makes math work? What are its shortcomings,
and how can we use it more effectively?
by K. HENRY
Because we know something of num-
bers and their relationships to each
other and to the real world, our bridges
stay strung, our buildings stand straight,
and our electric lights stay lit. In short,
we have the best developed technology in
the history of the earth.
We also have the most highly devel-
oped mathematics yet known to mankind.
Our children in grade school do things
with numbers that would have astounded
a Doctor of Mathematics of the Roman
Empire and put his most complex com-
putations to shame.
Nearly every modern discovery of
science, nearly every manufactured prod-
uct, nearly every company in existence
uses some of the principles, discoveries,
and processes of mathematics.
I think, then, that you will grant that
there seems to be some power, some force
in mathematics that makes all this pos-
sible. What is the nature of it and how
did it come to exist?
Consider the power in a spinning
wheel. In free space, it has no power, no
control of force; it can do nothing. When
held to a car by friction, and held to the
road by gravity, it can propel or steer the
vehicle. When equipped with teeth and
attached to an arbor, it can saw and
shape matter. And so on, ad infinitum.
Basically, the intrinsic power in a spin-
ning wheel must be harnessed and direct-
ed in order to be usable.
The same is true of mathematics in a
very much wider and more general sense.
The basis of mathematics is that if the
statements A, B, C &amp; D are true of any-
thing then also H and I are true of that
thing. Thus mathematics considers state-
ments in their own right and their rela-
tions to each other whether or not they
are known to be true of anything. Since
often there are many things which satis-
fy a common set of axioms, and anything
found to be a consequence of the axioms
is equally applicable to all of them,
mathematics can often make the effort
of one job do the work of many. Thus,
people, potatoes, and protons can all be
counted with the same set of numbers.
Still, the power of mathematics is not
realized until some of these sets of ax-
ioms, some of these statements, are
found to be true of something.
The power is not there, or is not use-
ful (which is practically the same thing),
until mathematics is harnessed, tied to
the real world. At times, it seems that
the axioms in a particular set are "self-
evident." Euclid thought the axioms of
his geometry were self-evident and uni-
versally true. They weren't. Taking an
ideal plane in the physical world, we
know now that if one vertex of a tri-
angle with straight lines were in an in-
tense gravitational field, the interior an-
gles would not add up to 180 degrees.
Now it is true that for most measure-
ments, we wouldn't be off by more than
a millionth of one per cent or so, and
hence it wouldn't usually make much
difference that the conclusions from the
false set of assumptions weren't quite
true; however it does demonstrate that
you can't "go all the way" on unproved
axioms and expect to be right.
This is one of the reasons that the
Chinese (who did some beautiful work in
geometry, for instance) never developed
the physical sciences and the technology
that we have. They didn't harness their
discoveries, they didn't tie their axioms
down to the real world with experiment,
explanation, and more experiment. On
the other hand, it's obvious, I think, that
it is very difficult to get far merely by
experimenting. This is perhaps why the
social sciences lag behind the physical;
it seems that it is more difficult to find
a set of axioms that we can prove are

These stars provide the basis for measuring the
broad expanses of space.
by CHARLES MASSER
Six trillion miles, the distance traveled
by light in a one-year period. This
seems to be an endless distance, yet
it requires one hundred thousand years
for lght to cross our galaxy. Over
two million years is needed for light to
travel to Andromeda, our neighboring
galaxy, and six billion years is needed
to touch the furthest detected galaxy. One
can feel how insignificant man is on his
small world, Earth. But this smallness did
not inhibit man's imagination or his quest
for knowledge of the unknown universe.
The questions of the unknown began to
fall one by one. But man can be wrong
with his theories. One such theory ex-
plained the size of the universe. In this
theory the size of the universe was re-
lated to the brightness of certain stars
called "Cepheid Variables." However,
certain assumed properties of these stars
have, in the past decade, been proven
false.
First Measurements of Milky Way
The first attempt to measure our gal-
axy, the Milky Way, was made in 1906
by a Dutch astronomer by the name of
Jacobus Cornells Kapteyn. He and his
associates made a survey of our galaxy
and arrived at this theory. Since the
Milky Way, as seen from the Earth, ap-
pears to be uniformly distributed in a
small band around the Earth, our gal-
axy should be a lens-shaped object
23,000 light years in diameter and 6,000
light years thick at the center. He also
stated that our solar system was located
near the center of our galaxy due to the
uniform distribution of the Milky Way.
Discovery of "Cepheid Variables"
Soon a new approach in determining
the distance to stars was developed. The
use of a certain class of variable star,
(a star which varies in brightness) was
the key to the approach. At this time
it was known that variable stars were
caused by either a dim companion which
eclipses the brighter star or by repeated
small internal explosions. In the latter
case one of the first stars studied was
Delta Cephei in the constellation Ce-
pheus. It completes its cycle in a period
of 5 1/3 days. A period of two days is
needed from its dimmest to brightest
point. It then requires 3 1/3 days to fade
back to its original dim point.
A study of the spectrum of Delta Ce-
phei reveals it contracts and expands
during its pulsation in brightness. If
the star remained at the same tempera-
ture during this pulsation it could be
easily understood when it is at its bright-
est it would be at peak size and when it
is at its dimmest it would be at minimum
size. But there is a temperature change.
The star is hottest at peak brightness and
coolest at the dim point. However, peak
brightness and peak temperature do not
occur at peak size, but when it is expand-
ing and 1/2 the way towards peak size.
The dimmest point and coolest tempera-
ture come when the contraction is l/2 tne
way towards minimum size.
This variable star, Delta Cephi, became
very important when astronomers real-
ized that many other variable stars stud-

label of "Cepheid variables" was placed
on this group of special stars. When the
astronomers searched the globular clus-
tered in our galaxy for cepheid variables
they were rewarded. Most of these varia-
bles had extremely short periods which
ranged from \y2 to 24 hours. These var-
iables were first called "cluster Cepheids;"
however, with the continued improve-
ment of astronomical equipment, many
short period variables were found out-
side of the globular clusters. The most
studied short period variable was a star
named RR Lyrae. Due to much misunder-
standing the name "cluster Cepheids"
was changed to "RR Lyrae Variables."
"Period-Luminosity Curve"
None of these studies seemed to have
any connection with the size of the
universe until 1912, when several dozen
Cepheid variables were found in the
small Magellanic Cloud by Miss Henri-
etta Leavitt. The small and large Magel-


lanic Clouds are visible as two foggy
patches which resemble detached rem-
nants of the Milky Way. They are only-
visible in the Southern Hemisphere and
were first seen by Ferdinand Magellan
in 1520 on his voyage around the World.
In her studies Miss Leavitt found there
was a smooth relationship between the
brightness of these Cepheid variables and
their period of variation. The graph
which was formed using the data was
called the "period-luminosity curve". Us-
ing this curve and the data compiled on
the other Cepheid variables, astronomers
needed to know the exact distance to
only one Cepheid variable and the dis-
tances to all the others could be calcu-
lated on the graph.
Flickering Yardstick Found
The astronomers ran into a problem
here. The most accurate method to meas-
ure distance to a star was to measure its
parallax, the difference in direction of the
star as seen from a point on Earth six


Exposures of 6, 15, 37, and 94 minutes show an increase of one magnitude on each
succeeding exposure of the globular star cluster in Hercules.

24
months apart. However, this is only ac-
curate to 100 light years and the nearest
Cepheid variable, the North Star, is sev-
eral times further; therefore this method
proved useless. A long, arduous, complex
statistical analysis of medium-distant (not
globular) star clusters was forced on the
astronomers. When they determined the
distance to the cluster the distance to the
Cepheid variables in this dusted were
also determined.
A flickering yardstick was now held by
the astronomers. The Cepheid variables
would reveal their distance by their
brightness and their period of variation.
Further studies in 1918 by Harlow Shap-
ley verified the distance to several glob-
ular clusters. In his measurements he used
the RR Lyrae variables combined with the
period-luminosity curve of Miss Leavitts.
However, in his studies Mr. Shapiey
found most of the globular clusters in
the part of the Milky Way which con-
tained the constellations of Sagittarius
and Scorpio. Why was this so? The an-
swer is that our solar system is not in the
center of our galaxy as we thought but
well out on one of the spiral arms. We
are still in the median plane of our gal-
axy because the Milky Way is evenly
split in the sky, but why does it have
the same brightness throughout the sky.-"
The answer is this. Near the outskirts of
our galaxy there are large amounts of
dust clouds. These dust clouds happen
to be between us and the center of our
galaxy, therefore completely obscuring
our view. Even with telescopes we can
see only the outskirt portions of our
galaxy. It is interesting to note that we
are in the center of the portion we can
see, and the size of that portion is not
far from Kapteyn's estimate. Kapteyn
assumed that the whole galaxy could be
seen from the Earth and that was his
error.
Final Model of Milky Way
The model of our galaxy which stil'
stands today is a lens-shaped affair that
is 100,000 light years across and 20,000
light years thick at the center falling off
to 3,000 light years at the extreme edge.
Our Sun is in a portion 30,000 light
years from the center.
The Cepheid variables in the Magel-
lanic Clouds were used to determine their
distance before the measurements of our
galaxy were completed. Accurate figures
show the small Magellanic Cloud to be
170,000 light years away while the large

RESEARCH
Edited by CHARLES MASSER
U. of M. Help Chile Rebuild
Chilean engineers, rebuilding after last
summer's earthquakes, will use jacks and
double foundations to correct unequal
settlement in some of their structures
and to facilitate repair of future earth-
quake damage of this type.
This idea, described by one Chilean as
"so simple and practical we wonder why
we didn't think of it," was suggested by
William S. Housel, a University of Mich-
igan professor of civil engineering. Pro-
fessor Housel returned in mid-September
from six weeks in Chile where he had
been invited to present a series of lec-
tures on soil mechanics and to visit con-
struction projects in southern Chile.
In the earthquakes there, buildings on
alluvial deposits or on man-made fills
suffered severe damage, he said, as these
soils settled unevenly and "bent" and
strained even well designed structures
(hotels, office buildings) built on them.
This settlement was an important factor
in the total earthquake damage. Much
rebuilding will have to be done on these
subsurface deposits of relatively loose
soils; hence his suggestion.
Professor Housel suggested laying a
concrete cap or "pad" on piles to serve
as a substructure for supporting "grade
beams" or piers on which the superstruc-
ture would rest. Jacks, or inserts for the
future installation of jacks, would be
built into the grade beam or piers. Un-
even settlement then could easily be cor-
rected — and the building made level
again—by adjusting the jacks. "About
the only objection to this idea is an in-
stinctive dislike for having a 'permanent'
structure on jacks," Professor Housel
noted.
Another major cause of damage to
lighter buildings, such as houses, was the
way these were set on basement walls.
"These were totally destroyed in one
area," he said. "In these cases, the
earthquakes' horizontal shock waves
moved the foundation walls out from
under and dropped the house into the
basement." Professor Housel described
the 53 engineers who attended his lec-
tures on soil mechanics as "very much
above average; extremely capable and
experienced engineers" who are greatly
interested in advanced soil mechanics.
In Chile, copper companies are ex-
panding and two large power companies
are constructing new plants, for which
foundations — and soil mechanics — are
very important, Professor Housel ex-
plained.
Most of the engineers attending the
lectures had been trained by teachers
from the European or eastern school of
soil mechanics. Consequently, there had
been some question whether Professor
Housel should be invited as a visiting
lecturer, because his views on many of
the important problems were quite dif-
ferent.
The professor stated, "This situation
presented a challenge and made the ex-
perience more satisfying when it turned
out that the Chilean engineers found the
Michigan brand of soil mechanics more
in keeping with their own experiences
with soil behavior." Professor Housel
has gained world-wide renown for his
advisory work on many civil engineering
projects around the globe. In Michigan,
he has advised about foundations for
such notable structures as the Mackinac
Bridge, and Cobo Hall and other Civic
Center buildings in Detroit.
Acceleration on Human Bones
An anatomist at The University of
Michigan Medical Center and engineers
from Wayne State University (Detroit)
are trying to find out how much accel-
eration a human can withstand before
his bones start to break. Their experi-
ments are expected to help astronauts
withstand the physical buffeting of re-
entry into the earth's atmosphere, and
promote safety for pilots being ejected
from high-speed jet planes.
Most previous acceleration studies have
been concerned with effects on blood
circulation, nervous system and general
human behavior. But Dr. F. Gaynor
Evans (PhD) at the U-M and Lawrence
M. Patrick and Herbert R. Lissner of
WSU are examining the effects of stren-
uous "G" forces on the intact human
skeleton.
In their continuing studies, the inves-
tigators hope to discover "the accelera-
tion threshhold for fractures"—the point
at which bones begin to crack under
the force of acceleration. In tests to
date, the researchers have exposed speci-
mens to accelerations up to 14 Gs (14
times the weight of gravity) without
causing fractures.
The test apparatus—built into an 8-
story elevator shaft at Wayne University
Medical School—will create forces up to
50 Gs. Results of progressive stages of
the investigation will be reported at medi-

Some of the more recent findings con-
cern the tensile and compressive strains
measured along the spinal column dur-
ing vertical acceleration, the effect of
restraint by seat belt and shoulder har-
ness, and the inadequacy of seat cushions
to absorb the shock of acceleration.
Awards
Professor Lewis N. Holland of the
Electrical Engineering Dept. was one of
five University of Michigan professors
to receive the "distinguished faculty
achievement" awards, consisting of a cer-
tificate and a $1,000 check.
Assistant Professor Bruce Clarke of the
Mathematics Dept. was one of four as-
sistant professors to receive a "distin-
guished service award," consisting of a
certificate and a check for $500.
Ernest F. Mazur, Professor of Engi-
neering Mechanics, was awarded the
I960 James Laurie Prize by the Ameri-
can Society of Civil Engineers at its an-
nual convention in Boston. The prize,
which consists of a cash award and cer-
tificate, was won for an article entitled
"Strength of Very Slender Beams," pub-
lished in the society's Transactions.
U of M to Launch Balloons
University of Michigan engineers will
launch three 16-story high balloons this
fall in a project designed to improve in-
terpretation of photographic and infra-
red data received from Uncle Sam's
weather eye satellite, Tiros.
Supervised by Fred L. Bartman, tthe
project is supported by a $270,000 con-
tract from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA). A
team of nine U-M engineers, headed
by Bartman, have participated in the
first launching at Sioux Falls, S. D.
The project is part of a continuing pro-
gram of upper atmosphere research con-
ducted by the High Altitude Engineer-
ing Laboratory of the U-M Department
of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engi-
neering. This Laboratory, which is di-
rected by Leslie M. Jones has launched
more than 75 high altitude rockets to
the upper atmosphere. The current proj-
ect makes the first use of large balloons
by the group.
The unmanned, 159-foot balloon is
expected to reach a maximum altitude of
120,000 feet on its 14-hour flight. It
will carry a 250 pound payload of photo-
graphic and infrared equipment in a 55
inch diameter by 25 inch high, all mag-

nesium gondola built by Magline Inc.,
Pinconning, Mch. A specially equipped
bus, carrying telemetering devices, will
follow and receive data from the balloon
on the ground. The gondola will be para-
chuted back to earth approximately 250
miles west of the launching site. Sub-
sequent flights, scheduled for late Octo-
ber and January, may cover 1,000 miles
or more because of changes in the pre-
vailing wind patterns.
According to Bartman, there's a 95 per
cent probability the equipment will be
recovered without serious damage. Pho-
tographic and infra-red data on weather
conditions will be compared 1) to im-
prove interpretation of similar informa-
tion televised and telemetered from Tiros,
and 2) to seek improved methods of in-
strumenting the weather satellite. Because
the chances for safe recovery of their
equipment are high, balloons yield a
good deal more information at substan-
tially less expense than either rockets or
satellites.
On the first flight, infra-red radiome-
ters have been loaned to the U-M by the
Army. In subsequent launches, Tiros-type
radiometers will be used. The balloon
will be built, inflated, and set aloft by
Raven Industries of Sioux Falls. Research
Fabrication, of Ypsilanti, Mch., built a
device on the bus to control azimuth and
elevation of the tracking antenna. Much
of the receiving equipment was built in
U-M shops. Environmental tests were
conducted at Bendix Systems Divi-
sion, Ann Arbor. Engineers who have
developed the equipment used both in

eling to Sioux Falls with Bartman in-

Study on Air Turbulence
Nature's trick of making stars twinkle
is being duplicated here by University of
Michigan researchers studying air turbu-
lence over water and how it affects evap-
oration and wave motion. Ultimate re-
sults of the basic research could be highly
significant in the Great Lakes' water di-
version problem, for scientists have esti-
mated that the Lakes' evaporation loss
roughly equals the 30-inch annual rain-
fall in the Great Lakes basin.

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&amp;WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt &amp; Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you do?—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can flourish.
For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,

At P&amp;WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab-
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused
on the development of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this live mock-up
of a reactor, nuclear scientists and engineers can
determine critical mass, material reactivity coefficients,
control effectiveness and other reactor parameters.

Representative of electronic aids functioning for P&amp;WA
engineers is this on-site data recording center which

addition to simple cutting, Plasmatron
rock cutting is said to be useful in shap-

formation of the molten rock.
The Plasmatron guns are being widely

Countdown for the Bird
Missilemen commonly refer to their
rockets as "birds," but only the Douglas
launch team on Pad 17B at Cape Canav-
eral can claim to have launched a real,
honest-to-goodness, genuine bird.
The bird, a stubborn, redheaded wood-
pecker persisted in hammering away at
an electrical cable assembly high on the
umbilical mast at 17B. Itts perforations
of the styrofoam and aluminum tape cov-
ering the cable alarmed Douglas engi-
neers, so they tried to rout Mr. Wood-
pecker.
But the woodpecker ignored such tra-

more sophisticated techniques, such as
sounding a loud horn which they fas-
tened on the mast, or chilling the cable
with carbon dioxide.
Finally, in desperation, they put to-
gether a "countdown manual" and pre-
pared to launch the bird "missile-style."
A high-presure air bottle was attached
to the mast near the intruder's latest ex-

tended to the deck of the launch pad.

New Atomic Generator
The Martin Company has started test-
ing of a compact, lightweight generator
which can convert heat from a by-prod-
uct of nuclear reactors into electricity to
power advanced satellites and space
probes for at least a year. The conver-
sion system in the 125-watt unit uses no
moving parts.
The generator, which is being devel-
oped here by Martin's Nuclear Division
under contract to the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission, is called SNAP 1-A (Sys-
tem for Nuclear Auxiliary Power).
SNAP 1-A is roughly egg-shaped, 34
inches long and 24 inches in diameter.
Most of its dull metal surface is dotted
with screw-headed caps marking the lo-
cation of 277 thermocouples. The com-
plete generator weighs 175 pounds.
The new system promises more power
than any energy unit launched into space
so far either by the U.S. or the Soviet
Union. Some systems have combined solar
cells with chemical batteries to build up
to such wattage levels periodically, but
these cannot operate continuously at high
power.
Engineers point out that SNAP 1-A,
unlike solar cells, would not be affected
by the impact of micrometeorites in space.
Operating independent of the sun, the
nuclear unit would have the additional
advantage of being able to produce pow-
er while in the shadow of the earth. The
absence of moving parts in the conver-
sion system greatly reduces the chances
of any malfunction.

This cutaway drawing shows the inner components of SNAP 1-A. The new atomic
generator is now undergoing preliminary tests.
The fuel capsule for SNAP 1-A, which
will not be inserted until electrical and
environmental tests of the rest of the
system are complete, will be located at
the very center of the generator, support-
ed by light metal tubing. The capsule
will contain tightly-sealed pellets of a
radioactive material called Cerium-144,
which decays spontaneously, producing
heat in the metal around it.
As the inner ends of the thermoelec-
tric elements are heated, the outside ends
always remain somewhat cooler, so that
the difference in temperature produces a
small electric current in each pair. These
thermocouples are connected in series to
add up to 125 watts at 28 volts. Tests
being conducted now use an electrical
heater to simulate the fuel.
Cerium-144 is a normal by-product of
the fission process in all nuclear reactors.
The material which ultimately will power
SNAP 1-A is being separated from other
fission products at the Oak Ridge Na-
tional Laboratory of the AEC and will be
supplied to Martin in sealed form early
next year for use in the ground test unit.
As the radioisotope decays, the amount
of heat it produces will gradually de-
crease. For this reason, SNAP 1-A has
been built with a temperature-sensitive
shutter, which will let some of the heat
leak out at the beginning of operation
but will gradually clamp shut. Thus the
electrical output will remain constant at
125 watts for a full year and then will
taper off.
A solar cell system with the same con-
stant output might be comparable to
SNAP 1-A in weight, but would be much
bulkier unless a complex mechanical de-
vice were used to keep the cells pointed
toward the sun. Unoriented cells would
have to cover an area of more than 100
square feet.
Extensive and conclusive tests have
been carried out under contract to the
AEC to assure that the radioisotope fuel
of SNAP 1-A would not be released if a
satellite-carrying rocket exploded on the
launch pad or failed to reach orbital
velocity. Once in orbit, the fuel capsule
is designed to burn up completely upon
reentry into the atmosphere.
During ground-handling operations
before launch, the hollow interior of
SNAP 1-A can be filled with liquid mer-
cury, which acts as a shield for its radia-
tion. This could be drained, moments
before lift-off, to reduce the weight of the
payload.

This steel plant consumes 1/400th of the
electric power generated in the United States
Surprising? Not if you realize that steelmaking requires
a tremendous amount of electric power.
It takes about 20,000 electric motors to drive the
rolling mills and other equipment at our Sparrows Point
Plant, near Baltimore, the nation's largest steelmaking
plant. Here, at our own steam-electric generating station,
we produce enough power for a city of 250,000.
It goes without saying that we need the services of
electrical engineers to design, construct, and maintain

the vast and complicated array of electrical equipment
at our many plants and facilities.

Energy conversion is our business

Earth's attraction for an apple?
Free fall in relativistic space?
A complex meson field?
Built-in return power for project
Mercury?
How is it related to binding energy?
Gravity is both a bane and a boon to man's
efforts — and a thorough understanding of
it is of great significance in the completion
of Allison's energy conversion mission.
Gravity conditions our thinking on ad-
vanced assignments. For example, in
outer space there is a disorientation of
conventional design. The fact that large
accelerations can be obtained with low
thrust forces has taken us into the new field
of electrical propulsion, ion and magneto-
hydrodynamic rockets.
In our inquiries, we supplement our own
resources by calling on many talents and
capabilities: General Motors Corporation,
its Divisions, other individuals and organi-
zations. By applying this systems engineer-
ing concept to new projects, we increase
the effectiveness with which we accom-
plish our mission — exploring the needs of
advanced propulsion and weapons systems.

x = horizontal distance relative to the
stationary system
v = velocity of the moving system rela-
tive to the stationary system
y' = height relative to the moving system
y = height relative to the stationary sys-
tem
z' = breadth relative to the moving sys-
tem
z = breadth relative to the stationary sys-
tem
r/ = time relative to the moving system
t= time relative to the stationary system.
From this it is easy to see that when v is
small relative to c, the values will be
comparatively unchanged, but as v ap-
proaches c the equations are radically
changed.
These equations are remarkable be-
cause they indicate that space and time
are not independent entities but are re-
lated; time as measured by an observer
in one system is different from that meas-
ured by an observer in another system
which is moving relative to the first.
With appropriate calculations, Einstein
showed that as velocity increases the
length of an object shortens in the direc-
tion of the motion, clocks slow down,
and mass increases. As the velocity in-
creases and approaches c, the length of an
object becomes shorter until at v = c.
the object shrinks away to nothing and
time stops. This being the case, it is easy
to see that the velocity of light is the
limiting velocity of the universe.
Mass vs. Velocity
One of the most important deductions
of the relativity theory is the relationship
between mass and velocity. This result
follows from the requirement that the
laws of conservation of mass and mo-
mentum must hold for a system of par-
ticles in either of two reference systems
moving at a constant velocity relative
to each other. The mass of a particle mov-
ing with a velocity v relative to a given
reference system is given by

famous equation was derived:
E = mc2
Most of the previous deductions were
results of the special theory of relativity.
In formulating the special theory Ein-
stein adopted two basic postulates. First,
the laws of physical phenomena are the
same when stated in terms of either of
two reference systems at a constant veloc-
ity relative to each other. Second, the
velocity of light is the same for all ob-
servers, and is independent of the rela-
tive velocities of the source of light and
the observer. The term special refers to
the restriction in the first postulate to
reference systems moving at a constant
velocity relative to each other. Not until
1916 did Einstein successfully show that
physical laws can be expressed in a form
that is valid for any choice of space-time
coordinates. This general expression is
what is known as the general theory of
relativity.
General Relativity
The extension of special relativity to
the realms of the universe brought about
some rather perplexing concepts. One
of these concepts was that the universe
is a four dimensional continuum consist-
ing of length, breadth, height and time.
The basic premise of the general theory
was that laws of nature are the same for
all systems regardless of their state of
motion. From this general concept, a
new theory of gravity was formulated.
It stated that bodies do not attract each
other as one ordinarily thinks of attrac-
tion, instead gravity is a segment or form
of inertia. Einstein described it as a field
and that gravitational attraction was the
paths bodies followed in the field. The
so-called force of attraction is simply
due to their motion through the space-
time continuum.
Recall the equation E = mc- and the
following deductions. Light is energy,
energy has mass according to the above
equation, mass is affected by the laws of
the gravitational field, therefore light
will be attracted by the laws of gravita-
tion. Using this result, Einstein postu-
lated a shape of the universe. Prior to
Einstein the universe was pictured as an
island of matter afloat in an infinite sea
of space. However, Newton's laws did
not permit an infinite universe contain-
ing uniform distribution of matter be-
cause then the sum of gravitational
forces of all the masses stretching to in-
finity would be infinite, hence the uni-
verse would be a glowing mass. To fur-
ther disprove the infinite matter postu-
late, observations showed that the uni-
verse gets sparser as one gets farther
out.
The difficulty here arose from the as-
sumption that Euclidian geometry was
valid. Einstein, however, stated that the
universe was non-Euclidian and hence
finite. In the Einstein universe there are
no straight lines, only circles. In this
sense the universe can be likened to a
sphere with unbound reaches. According
to the laws of gravitational fields each
body in the universe distorts the space-
time continuum. The greater the con-
centration, the greater the distortion.
Hence the whole effect is a curvature of
the space-time continuum.
A Finite Age to the Universe
At the time of the theory, physicists
thought that the universe was in ran-
dom motion. Later observations with re-
fined instruments showed that at the
present time the universe is in a state of
expansion, and the closer systems are
moving away from the earth slower than
those farther away. Since every system is
moving away from every other system,
they must have at one time been together
in order to expand. This may indicate
that the universe, as we know it, had a
beginning, according to calculations based
on the rate of expansion, about 6 bil-
lion years ago. One cannot be sure
whether or not the universe actually had
a beginning, but if one combines the
second law of thermodynamics with the
fact that the universe is expanding, it is
a fairly strong indication that the uni-
verse did have a beginning. All present
observations show that energy is dissipat-
ing. The second law of thermodynamics
shows that this dissipation is irreversible
and must reach maximum entropy. If
this is the case, then the universe must
have started at some point when every-
thing was energy and will end when it
has all dissipated.
If somehow the second law of thermo-
dynamics were not valid and the pro-
cesses of nature were reversible, then it
is conceivable that the universe is now
in a phase of oscillation. In other words,
the universe oscillates between two states
of maximum and minimum energy. To
make this possible, the process of dissi-
pation must be reversible and at some
point the energy must congeal, contract,
and expand, the present phase being the
expansion state. If the latter is true, then
the universe in terms of matter and en-
ergy is infinitely old.
The Role of Relativity
The special theory of relativity has
been indispensable to the development of
atomic and nuclear physics. Nothing ex-
emplifies the validity of the theory more
than the advent of the Nuclear Age.
The general theory has done much to
explain how the universe behaves and
has brought unity to many scattered con-
cepts. When the theory was first pre-
sented it was held in utter contempt by
the majority of physicists, but refine-
ments in measurements and experimental
methods soon showed that the theory
was sound. Not only does the theory be-
come useful as a tool for investigation,
but it points out an important fact: theory
is the basis for practicability. Without
theory few phenomena could be ex-
plained. Relativity is one of the best
examples and one of the strongest cases
for theory.

cloud is 150,000 light years away. Since
these two clouds are small, relative to
our galaxy, and relatively close in dis-
tance, they could be termed "satellite
galaxies" of ours.
Other Galaxies Discovered
It was in the 1920's before anyone
looked beyond the Magellanic Clouds for
other galaxies. On a clear moonless night
a hazy patch about half the size of the
Moon could be seen in the constellation
Andromeda. It was called the Andro-
meda Nebula; the word nebula coming
from the Greek word for cloud. A point
of misunderstanding should be cleared up
here. There were several nebulae discov-
ered in our galaxy. However, these nebu-
lae were formed by highly luminous
gaseous clouds which were created by
extremely hot stars. The Orion Nebula
is an excellent example of this. The An-
dromeda Nebula, however, was not
formed from hot stars. If one had the
proper magnification this nebula could
possibly be broken into many far dis-
tant stars. This was done in 1924 by
Edwin Powell Hubble. He used the 100-
inch telescope at Mount Wilson to take
several photographs which showed the
Andromeda Nebula broken down into
fields of fine stars. He also found Ce-
pheid variables in the outskirts of the
nebula, and he used them to calculate
their distance. For the next thirty years
the figure of 750,000 light years stood as
the distance to the Andromeda Nebula.
Hubble also announced to the World
that many other nebulae were even
beyond the Andromeda Nebula. The uni-
verse which was a mere 100,000 light
years in diameter had expanded to hun-
dreds of millions of light years. How-
ever, the astronomers still had a few
questions to answer. First, Why did the
other galaxies that were measured seem
to be considerably smaller than our
Milky Way? Second, The Andromeda
Nebula also had small globular clusters
just as the Milky Way had, but they
were much smaller than ours. Why?
Third, since the universe was known to
be expanding, a starting point could be
calculated. The universe had expanded
for only two billion years, but geologists

What Significance Entropy?
(Continued from page 16)
basis of Scripture) that there is a God
who created and maintains the universe.
This might mean either one or both of
two things as regards the Second Law.
The universe could have been created
in such a state that it has a capacity for
a great increase of entropy, and the nat-
ural processes which have been taking
place for millions of years have occurred
with an attendant increase in entropy. Or
perhaps God is still active in this uni-
verse in the sense of a continued creation
(as suggested by Hoyle in a non-theistic
framework) or in another process which
offsets the continued increase in entropy
which we observe.
One point should be made clear. The
Second Law does not constitute a proof
for the existence of God, nor does it
seem that such proofs are possible. Nat-
ural phenomena, such as the Second Law,
are however legitimate evidence which,
along with many other factors, make the
presupposition that there is a God, rea-
sonable and consistent with empirical
data. It does not appear inconsistent with
any observed phenomena.
4. The relation of the Second Law to life
is an intensely interesting subject. First
of all we note that we do not live as
isolated beings, for we receive food and
oxygen and give off various waste prod-
ucts. In fact, our very life depends on
receiving food and air, because isolation
can mean only one thing, namely death.
From another point of view every living
organism has the sentence of death in
itself, and death is staved off only by
avoiding isolation and receiving food
and air. It is in some ways, like the
oxygen-hydrogen mixture, where the in-
crease in entropy can be avoided by the
absence of a spark.
This leads to another interesting ques-
tion, namely, what is the entropy of a
living organism? Is the entropy of a liv-
ing organism less than the entropy of
this organism immediately after death?
Does the entropy of a living being in-
crease with age? Unfortunately we can
only raise these questions, for we know
of no way of either measuring or defin-
ing the entropy of a living organism.
Perhaps some "life principle" must be
discovered before these answer can be
given. Could it be that this life principle
can be explained only in the context of
the Creator?
5. The final point I would make is
that the entropy concept is being applied
to many areas. Perhaps the most signifi-
cant of these is in communication theory.
This concept concerns the communication
of a message. Perfect communication
would correspond to a reversible process,
and would result in no increase of en-
tropy and no loss of information in
transmission. The more imperfect the
communicaton, the greater the increase
in entropy. Perhaps a new criterion for
evaluating professors could be devel-
oped—the increase of entropy per lecture
hour, per student! However, one must
keep in mind that effective communica-
tion depends on both the transmitter and
the receiver!
Undoubtedly you can find many ways
to apply the entropy concept to various
spheres of your life. How much does the
entropy increase during an evening of
home work? Is there a greater increase
of entropy during an evening of argu-
ment as compared to an evening of
study?
I have been tempted to suggest that
theologians apply the concept of entropy
to various religious concepts. The stand-
ard for our life (in the Christian con-
text) is perfection. Perhaps every fail-
ure and breaking of the moral law, or
sin, has an associated increase in entropy,
and the forgiveness of sins, which the
Christian gospel presents, can be consid-
ered as a restoration to the state of mini-
mum entropy. And could this matter of
heaven and eternity be related to an
existence in which there was no increase
in entropy—only reversible processes?
Certainly time would have no meaning
in this case.
Finally, how much has the entropy in-
creased during the writing and reading
of this article? I can only hope that it
has been modest.

York University, '60). Recently, as part of his job in marketing
at IBM, he found himself assisting the customer technicians
with the design problems of one of the world's busiest bridges.

WHAT'S AN IBM MAN GOT TO DO
WITH REDESIGNING A BRIDGE?
Tom O'Connell is an engineer working in marketing areas as an
IBM Data Processing Representative. His job is to introduce
management to the advantages of electronic data processing.
Once they have acquired an IBM system, he acts as a con-
sultant on new uses for the system.
A Spectacular Engineering Achievement. How is he helping to
redesign a bridge? One of his clients is the agency which con-
structs and operates transportation facilities in the New York-
New Jersey area. Recently, they began to add a lower deck to
the George Washington Bridge. It has been a spectacular engi-
neering achievement. Sections were brought up the Hudson
River on barges and hoisted hundreds of feet into position. All
this while heavy traffic continued in both directions.
This double-decking of one of the world's busiest bridges took
complex planning. An IBM system materially aided in the veri-
fication of bridge design calculations and in suspension bridge
truss analysis under various loading conditions. Tom O'Connell
supplied many of the computer programs that were used in
conjunction with other programs developed by the customer.
Tom now knows a lot more about the problems of bridge design.
A Job That Makes News. One of the exciting aspects of Data
Processing Marketing at IBM is this wide diversity of systems
application. Using the knowledge a man has gained in college,

true of people and also are capable of
extensive logical expansion.
The basic of our technology is the at-
tempt to make nature do our work for
us. At one time, plowing was done by
a stick in the hand of a man. He found
this took some energy. Since man, by
nature, is a lazy cuss, he looked around
for some way to plow that would take
less of his energy. He found the horse
and later the tractor. In both cases, in
order to use the resources of nature he
first had to understand to a degree and
make use of the forces involved. He had
to understand nature.
Every law of nature can be expressed
mathematically. If we discover some laws
of nature we can, using the process of
mathematics, deduce other truths which
apply to nature. Since no experiment
will prove a universal law of nature, we
have other checks. First, of course, we
do more experiments to determine how
universally this law seems to hold. Then
we make deductions from this law and
the others that seem to hold and see if
they too are true where we determined
the others. If they are not, then, since we
know they would be if the laws we de-
rived them from were true, we know that
somewhere along the line one of the
laws, axioms if you will, does not hold.
The system of laws developed in this
way is known as Science.
You will recall that this is the way
that Einstein developed his famous Spe-
cial Theory of Relativity. An ether was
postulated to describe the motion of light.
Michelson and Morley, using this and
other laws, proved by experiment that
the earth must then be stationary with
relation to the ether. Since we know that
the earth rotates, moves around the sun,
moves with the sun in our galaxy, etc., it
is indeed difficult to assume that of all
the heavenly bodies, the earth is station-
ary while everything else moves.
Einstein took the laws which would
satisfy all of the experimental findings,
namely that the velocity of light is con-
stant and motion through the ether is
undetectable, and proposed other experi-
ments whose results he would try to pre-
dict with his laws. Since his new laws
explained everything that the old ones
did, and some things that they didn't, if
they also predicted correctly the results
of another experiment, for which the old
laws gave a different answer, the new
ones would be held as correct until
something came along that they couldn't
explain but some other set could. He
predicted correctly.
Then the power of mathematics de-
rives from its generality and is harnessed
by relating it to the real world.
In practice, we find that useful theories
often don't arise because of their need
but rather were already there and in var-
ious stages of development when the
need arose. Heisenberg (of the Heisen-
berg Uncertainty Principle) found, after
he had developed an algebra to deal with
the sub-atomic particles he was working
with, that the system (matrix algebra)
had been known to mathematicians for
some time. Power transmission engineers
found that they needed to use imaginary
numbers, which had been invented mere-
ly to make the number system more com-
plete, in order to explain and describe

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Many phases of mathematics that are
useful now were originally developed
just to please the men who developed
them. Consider, for example, this mod-
ern problem: a telephone switchboard is
being set up to take care of 1,000 busi-
ness telephones in downtown Detroit.
They would like to arrange it so that
ever)' call gets through with the shortest
possible delay while using as few trunk
lines as possible. Delay means dissatisfac-
tion and waste of time, while too many
trunk lines means wasted money.
First we do a survey of how much the
telephones are used (with the aid of sta-
tistical methods, of course). Suppose we
find that the average call lasts five min-
utes and the average phone is used 16
times in the 9-to-5 day and four times
in the peak hour of 2 to 3- Thus we need
at least 333 lines to keep everybody
happy if the calls are perfectly timed.
Let us assume that it is all right if a
customer is delayed once in say 20 calls
made during the rush hour. Using the
methods of probability theory we find
that considerably fewer than 400 trunk
lines are needed to do the job quite sat-
isfactorily.
Obviously this branch of mathematics
has some use. But how did it develop? It
developed first as a pastime and aid to
gamblers. They noticed, in the fifteenth
century, that certain things, such as
throwing a seven with two dice, hap-
pened more often than other things,
such as throwing a twelve with two dice.
Various problems were proposed and
some mathematicians became interested
in the several ways of solving them.
One such problem was given to Pascal
in a letter from the French gambler
DeMere in 1654. He said that he dis-
covered something that surprised him.
DeMere said that the probability of get-
ting a six in four throws of one dice
should be the same as the probability of
getting a twelve in twenty-four throws
of two dice. Now, this is quite obviously
true, since the probability of getting a six
in one throw is 1/6 and that of a twelve
is 1/36 and there are six times as many
throws in the second case. However, this
is only common sense and it didn't work
out that way in fact. When DeMere per-
formed the experiment, it turned out
that the first result, a six in four throws,
happened slightly more often.
Pascal treated the problem mathemat-
ically. He said that the probability in
the first case is one minus the probability
of not getting a six in four independent
throws, which can be shown to be equal
to 1 — (5/6)* = 0.518. Using the same
technique, the probability in the second
case is 1 — (35/36) ■* = 0.491. This can
be mathematically proved with only a
few axioms, the most important of which
is that a six is just as likely to turn up as
a five or any other number on each indi-
vidual dice, i.e., the dice are "honest."
This illustrates one of the most im-
portant strengths of mathematics: As long
as the axioms are true of the subject in
question, the results of mathematical
manipulation hold even when common
sense fails completely. That is, in some
sense, mathematics is stronger than the
human mind. On the other hand, it is,
of necessity, a product of the human
mind and should be subject to the limi-
tations thereof; but if we continue in
this vein we will have a highly philo-
sophical discussion which is outside the
realm of this article.
Now we have some idea of the range
and power of the discipline called mathe-
matics, and even how some areas got
their start, but of course the first man
who counted past three didn't start by
setting down axioms and proving that

had proof that the Earth was at least six
billion years old. How come? Was the
Earth older than the universe?
Andromeda Nebula Holds Answer
It was during Warld War II that the
answers came. Since Los Angeles was
blacked out due to the war, the annoying
background light was gone. Walter Baade
took this time to photograph the Andro-
meda Nebula. Due to the excellent con-
ditions Baade found his photographs
had resolved the inner portions of the
galaxy. He was then able to study the
bright interior regions along with the
dimmer outskirts. He discovered two sets
of stars in this galaxy with a different
structure and history. He labeled the
outskirt stars Population I and the in-
terior stars Population II.
About 98 percent of the stars in the
universe fall into the Population II group.
Most of these stars are old, moderately
sized with fairly constant characteristics.
They are found only in space-dust free

surroundings. The Population I stars are
not consistent in their characteristics, but
they are always found in the dust-choked
spiral arms of the galaxies.
When the 200-inch telescope was com-
pleted on Palomar Mountain, Baade
continued studying the two sets of stars.
He found Cepheid variables in both
groups. The Cepheid variables in the
Magellanic Clouds where no dust is
found were Population II variables. The
RR Lyrae variables also belong to this
group. As a matter of fact the Cepheid
variables in the globular clusters for
which the actual distance was worked
out statistically were all Population II
variables. This means the size of the uni-
verse was calculated using the Popula-
tion II Cepheid variables as yardsticks.
However, the distance to the Andromeda
Nebula and other galaxies were calcu-
lated using large giant variables which
fall into the Population I Cepheids.
Flickering Yardstick Lengthened
Everything would have been all right if
the Population I Cepheids would fit into
a period-luminosity curve. But in 1952
after a painstaking comparison of Popu-
lation I and II variables, Baade announced
the Population I Cepheids did not fit the
period-luminosity curve. A Population I
Cepheid was about seven times brighter
than that of a Population II Cepheid of
the same period.

Using the law that the brightness var-
ies inversely as the square of the distance
we can easily see the flickering yardstick
of the Cepheid variables becomes almost
three times as long as believed. Suddenly
the universe expanded, all of the gal-
axies that were measured using the orig-
inal yardstick were pushed away from us
by almost three times their believed dis-
tance.
The three questions asked by the as-
tronomers were answered. Our galaxy
had suddenly been reduced in size until
the Andromeda Nebula was larger than
ours. In fact it has four to five times as
many stars as our Milky Way.
With the expansion the globular clus-
ters in the Andromeda Nebula become
much further away than thought. There-
fore, their brightness becomes compara-
ble to our globular clusters. With the
whole universe spread out, the amount
of time from the starting point of the
recession was pushed back four to five
billion years. So the figure of six billion
years as the age of the universe coincided
with the geologists. The Earth was no
longer older than the universe.

WORLD'S HEAVIEST TRAFFIC!
Say good-bye to washboard pavements and
chuck holes—their doom may be sealed!
Key weapon in the war on costly road dam-
age is a new miniature highway developed in
the Standard Oil research laboratories in
Whiting, Indiana. It is only 12 inches wide and
44 feet in circumference, but it carries heavier
loads than any highway in the world. This Tom
Thumb turnpike will eventually lead to meth-
ods of building longer-lasting, smoother, safer
highways...at far less cost to taxpayers.
Four wheels whirling around hour after hour
can give it any degree of traffic intensity de-
sired. Pressure that corresponds to the weight
of the heaviest trucks can be applied to the
wheels. To simulate actual traffic, the wheels
are placed on braking and acceleration 90 per
cent of the time. Automated electronic equip-
ment can quickly change "road conditions"
from desert dry to cloudburst drenched."Road
conditions", too, can be changed from freezing
to thawing.
Within weeks, the new test-tube roadway
can determine what happens to roads during
years of use in all kinds of weather. It can pre-
test paving formulas and techniques, and may
show how to eliminate washboard pavement
and chuck holes. Savings in highway research
alone may run into millions of dollars. Even
larger savings in auto and road repairs and
possibly in gasoline taxes are in sight.
This test-tube roadway is just one of the
many exciting developments at Standard.
Every day, scientific research, pure and applied,
points the way to new or improved products.
This work holds great challenge and satisfac-
tion for young men who are interested in scien-
tific and technical careers.

The twinkle of a man-made "star" is being checked with this special telescope and
photocell. It is used to record the way light is refracted or
deflected by turbulence.
The project is one of a number by the
Great Lakes Research Division of the
University's Institute of Science and
Technology. The Division is conducting
a highly diversified investigation of the
Lakes about which little is known scien-
tifically. The researchers' "star" is a pow-
erful light attached to the Charlevoix
breakwall which hurls its beam a mile
and one-half across Lake Michigan waters
into the lens of a telescope located on a
point of land below the city.
At the rear of the telescope is a photo-
cell which translates the light's twinkling
into electrical energy so that the fluctua-
tions may be recorded in graphic form.
Just as a star appears to twinkle because
the earth's atmosphere varies in density,
so does this light twinkle as it passes
above the water's surface. In the case of
the man-made light the atmosphere is
air immediately above the water, made
turbulent by variations in the wind and
air and water temperatures. The light is
refracted or deflected as it passes through
this turbulent air, causing variations in
its intensity.
It is anticipated that correlation of
these variations with known conditions
of wind and temperature obtained from
instruments stationed in the light's path
will make possible a new data-gathering
technique that may be used almost any-
where over water.
Once such data is obtained, mathemati-
cal formulas considering such items as
molecular transfer between air and water
will be used to determine findings. The
project is under the direction of Donald
J. Portman, assisted by Floyd G. Elder,
both U-M meteorologists.

they applied to objects in the real world,
he just counted. We might say that the
road to power and glory for mathemat-
ics was begun by people who counted
the way some primitive groups still
count: one, two, three, many.
This may not be as far back as you
think, for I recall an incident in the
Korean War when a commanding officer
heard that an assault was being made at
one point of the U.N. line. He called
that company and asked the officer at
that end how many Chinese were com-
ing over the hill. The answer: "Oh,
many, many!" He got the same answer
from the second officer he talked to, and
finally asked to speak to the commanding
officer there. His answer: "A whole pot
full of 'em, sir!" to which the officer
replied, "Well, I'm glad somebody over
there can count!"
In any case, there was a time when
the largest number that people could dif-
ferentiate was three. This lead to some
problems for the shepherd, who might
have thirty or forty sheep. He solved it
ingeniously. At the side of the entrance
to the fold, he put a small pile of stones
equal to the number of sheep he had.
Then when he brought the sheep in for
the night, as each one entered the fold
he transferred a stone from one pile to
another. If there were any stones left over
when all the sheep were in, he went out
to look for the lost sheep.
The principle this shepherd used with-
out realizing it is one of the most impor-
tant principles in the science of counting.
The one to one correspondence is the
(Continued from page 47)
way that we determine the size of infin-
ity. In essence, all that the principle of
correspondence says is that if you can
arrange two groups of objects in such a
way that every item in the first group is
paired with one in the second group
with none used twice and none left over,
then the number of items in the first
group is equal to the number of items
in the second group. With it we can
prove some very interesting things. For
instance, the number of positive integers
is equal to the number of positive inte-
gral powers of 100, because we can set
up the following relationship which is
always satisfied:
1, 2, 3,
100, 10,000, 1,000,000,
4, 5
10,000,000 10,000,000,000
Using the same principle we can prove
that the positive real numbers, rational
and irrational, between zero and one
have more members than the positive
integers. Let us set up the following table
listing all the real numbers:
1. .345432211 ....
2. .457683320 ....
3. .986453778 ....
4. .864588449 ....
etc.
Now take the real number expressed
in the following way: the first digit will
be 1 unless the first digit in the first
number in our list is 1 in which case it
will be 0. The second digit will be found
in the same way using the second digit

of the second number of our list. It is
now obvious that this number is differ-
ent from every number in our list and
thus there are some real numbers left
over when we run out of positive inte-
gers and so there are more of them.
Now the shepherd never thought that
the principle he was using to count his
sheep could be used to determine how
big an infinity is, but it can, and this just
serves to point out again the power that
mathematics gains from the fact that all
you have to know is that the system sat-
isfies the necessary axioms, and you know
that all the deductions following from
those axioms are also true.
At one time the whole number sys-
tem consisted of: 1, 2, 3, 4, ... . though
perhaps other symbols were used. In this
system, anything one could get by add-
ing or multiplying was a number. But
people subtracted and divided too. In
order that everything one could get by
these processes be a number, the zero,
the negative integers, and the fractions
were added to the system.
Then some smart alec came along and
proved that the square root of two
couldn't be exactly represented in this
system, so the irrationals were added.
Then somebody who really sounded crazy-
asked what the square root of minus two
was. So the imaginaries were added. You
will remember that the power transmis-
sion engineers found a use for them, but
they were invented just because we
wanted some way to represent the square
root of minus two.
But all this is just counting better.
Mathematics also branched out into other
fields such as measuring, (the calculus),
finding likelihoods of an event's occur-
ring, (probability theory), representing
shapes and actions in numbers, (numeri-
cal analysis), and many more.
Without all that we've discussed above,
one couldn't drive a car without the fear
that one of those wheels we discussed
before would fall off due to the fact
that the engineer that designed it didn't
know how to calculate the size of the
axle needed to bear the load. We couldn't
turn on a light without the fear that we
would start a fire due to the fact that the
electrician couldn't calculate the gage
wire he needed to carry the current (and
in fact there wouldn't be wire gages).
In short, there's safety in numbers.

Mechanical Engineering
Mechanical Engineering is essential to virtually every industry and to every phase of technology. As
a result, it offers the widest range of opportunity and endeavor available in engineering today. In turn, this
requires that the mechanical engineer receive a broad and basic education which provides him with a
depth and breadth of understanding of the basic fundamentals—a background that characterizes mechan-
ical engineers and explains their ability to perform in all of the fields of engineering.
It is because of his wealth of technical background that a mechanical engineer finds such a wide
range of opportunities available. His education includes basic science and mathematics courses, non-tech-
nical courses, as well as a number of courses which may be termed engineering science.
Mechanical engineering courses at Michigan are directly supported by a number of laboratories in
which the student gains not only a background in particular areas, but also a general knowledge of
the scientific approach to engineering problems and the use of essential mechanical and scientific equip-
ment.
While the mechanical engineering curriculum, of necessity, must be broad and inclusive, there is
sufficient flexibility, even at the undergraduate level, to permit course work in particular areas of interest,
such as the automotive field, internal combustion engines, heat and power, metal cutting and manufactur-
ing, produce design, and materials.

SMOKE TUNNEL

Air flow past an airfoil at an angle of
attack is characterized by smooth
streamlines past the bottom surface,
while the flow over the top surface
changes from laminar to turbulent.
Changing the angle of attack of an air-
foil rapidly from 0 degrees to 14 de-
grees produces little change in the
streamlines above or below the airfoil,
but smoke vortices are formed at the
trailing edge, and rapidly grow in size.


A curve ball produces strange patterns
in the smoke tunnel. Notice the bow
wave extending from the ball, and the
turbulent flow in the region immedi-
ately behind the ball.

Cover Story
Bryan Whipple, in his Cooley Award
winning essay; "Individualism and Nat-
ura1 Superiority," has perceptively anal-
yzed the social phenomenon of individ-
ualism and its relationships to creativity,
politics, and economics.
His thesis stresses individualism as
cosmic law—as a natural and extremely
necessary fact of life. The fiction of the
equality of man leads the society into
a morass of complacency and apathy,
killing the dreams, causes, ideals and
ideas which motivate the social group.
To maintain a strong American De-
mocracy, we must, as responsible people,
assert out individualism and often, the
non-conformity attending it.

The £dltot 5 Pen —
CONTEMPLATIVE
From time to time we have commented about the desirabilty
of a good theoretical preparation for engineers as well as pointing
out an apparent lack of preparation of engineers for their role as
men in the world of today. As a result of these comments, several
suggestions have been made concerning the expansion of the course
requirements in the humanities or the elimination of some technical
courses to make room for additional courses in the liberal arts and
the humanities.
We must admit that these suggestions have not met with whit
could be called "enthusiastic support." From a realistic standpoint
this type of response was not unexpected. Any type of broad,
sweeping changes can usually expect rough going, regardless of the
merit of the proposals.
Neverthless, we are still convinced that a proficiency in the
engineering sciences will not be a sufficient background for the
successful engineer of tomorrow. As we have stressed before, engi-
neers do not work as self-sufficient little groups in tiny cells—they
are continually dealing with people in the areas of politics, law,
government, education, finance, etc. At the same time an engineer's
success depends more and more on an understanding of people
and their motives—and this understanding can be intensified if
based on a background of sociology, psychology, philosophy, and
literature, etc.
It is readily apparent that we would favor some substantial
changes in the engineering curriculum. However, as mentioned
previously, a realistic view points out that there is little likelihood
of such changes occurring. With this realization in mind, we would
like to suggest a minor change in the curriculum that could have
an important impact on the individual. We would like to see the
addition of one 2 hour course that would attempt to cause the
engineer to become aware of the world of ideas as well as the world
of equations; to cause him to become aware of ideas and beliefs
other than those that he has been indoctrinated with since child-
hood; to cause him to evaluate these ideas on their merits by instill-
ing within him the spirit of objective thought; and, in general, to
aid him in the achievement of intellectual maturity.
For this course—which might be called a Seminar in Con-
templative Thought—we visualize something quite different than
the normal student-instructor-classroom-course arrangement. In
place of this normal situation would be a course composed oi
reading, thought, discussion, and evaluation of one topic through-
out the semester. In this case the topic itself would be unimportant.
In a larger sense, what would be important was the fact that the
student went deeply into the foundations of an idea, evaluated a
number of approaches, and reached a conclusion that he could
support by logical reasoning. What conclusion was reached, what
topic was studied, or even the fact that only one topic was studied
would have little importance if the overall goals had been met—
namely, to make the student aware of the world of ideas and to
instill within him the desire to evaluate these ideas on the basis ot
the issues and not on the basis of preconceived notions.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


As for the mechanics of such a course, it might be set up so
that small groups of students would meet informally for a two hour
period each week—with the instructor acting as a stimulator and
moderator rather than teacher or judge—to discuss various aspects
of the given topic as presented in suggested readings. Quite pos-
sibly the course would not even meet during the last month of the
semester while the student prepared a paper stating the conclusion
he reached on the issue and substantiating the reasons for his con-
clusion. The topic itself, as has been stressed before, is not import-
ant (except that it should have substantial depth on both sides of
the question) but it might be selected from topics such as the
following:
Man's Existence—For what purpose?
Liberalism vs. Conservatism.
Capitalism and Unions—Compatible?
Foundations of Freedom—Is interference with them protection
or destruction of democracy?
Eventually, we would hope that such a course would become
a graduation requirement. The addition of two hours to the cur-
riculum should not be difficult but the effects of these two hours
could be highly significant. Admittedly, we don't feel that these
two hours would be enough, but it is a step in the right direction.
4nk Spot*
The Technic, as some of you know, makes staff promotions
and changes at the start of the second semester. Consequently, this
is an ideal time for interested students to begin working on the
Technic. If you have been interested in the Technic but circum-
stances have prevented you from participating up until this time,
why don't you drop into the office in the next several weeks to dis-
cuss the opportunities for you on the Technic staff.
The Technic feels privileged to publish in this issue an out-
standing essay entitled "Individualism and Natural Superiority."
Written by Bryan Whipple, this essay won the $500 first prize in
the I960 Cooley Eassy Contest.
The publication of this essay brings to mind the posters which
have recently appeared on campus bulletin boards announcing that
the 1961 Cooley Essay topic is "The Role of the Non-Technical in
the Education of the Engineer." As evidenced by the above edi-
torial, we feel that this area should be of great concern to the stu-
dent engineer. We hope that the selection of this topic by the
Cooley Essay committee will evoke a widespread consideration of
this important problem.

How do Yotli
Measure AcJiievexmeiit?
At Delco Radio Division of General Motors we consider
our position of prominence in the fields of electronics and
solid state physics a positive measure of achievement.
Talent—bold, imaginative talent stimulated by
the challenge of new concepts—was responsible for this
achievement.
However, past accomplishments are significant only
insomuch as they indicate the path of the future.
At Delco this path is clearly charted ... we intend to
maintain our leadership.
Our current intensive programs in semiconductor
device development and materials research unfold new
challenges daily. Meeting these challenges requires a constant
infusion of new ideas and new talent—aggressive new
talent. That's what we're looking for.

INDIVIDUALISM AND
NATURAL SUPERIORITY
by BRYAN WHIPPLE,
Associate Editor
Sir Isaac Newton, English philoso-
pher and mathematician, was one
of the greatest men of science. His
theories have set the groundwork
for many of today's advance-
ments.
"Americans are so enamoured of equal-
ity that they would rather be equal in
slavery than unequal in freedom."
—Alexis de Tocqueville1
Like the weather, conformity is some-
thing that everyone talks about, but
no one does anything about. In fact, it
is an evil so ill-defined, so little-docu-
mented, so totally under-researched, that
the popular conception of conformity is
completely befogged. Current opinion
assumes that conformity is undesirable
for some vague esthetic reason, somehow
connected with lessened fruitfulness and
joy in life. It is further widely held that
conformity arises from advertising press-
ures or other mass-communication phe-
nomena, and that its chief manifestation
is the grey-flannel suit.
In establishing the true import and
nature of our current lack of individual-
ism, recourse will be made to many of
the tools of analysis—definition of
terms, systematic study of uncertain
points, and deductive reasoning. Heuris-
tic methods—-example, analogy, induc-
tion, and pure philosophizing—will
round out what is intended to be a cross-
sectional precis of "the significance of
individualism today".
Perhaps we ought first to dispel the
current and widespread fiction that we
have ever been a nation of individualists.
The quotation heading this section,
penned by a keen foreign critic of
Americana, will serve as a thesis. We
derive a good portion of our national
philosophy from various documents
asserting the equality of all men (al-
though we have seldom practiced this
belief). Patently, this is not true. Every
human characteristic is distributed statis-
tically. Some are saints, some sinners;
some geniuses, some imbeciles—all men
are not "created equal". Thomas Jeffer-
son, author of this much maligned
phrase, himself repudiates this interpre-
tation of the famous Declaration of In-
dependence sentence with the following
words:
"There is a natural aristocracy among
men. The gounds of this are virtue
and talents .... The natural aris-
tocracy I consider as the most pre-
cious gift of nature, for the instruc-
tion, the trusts, and the government
of society." 2
American egalitarian philosophy has
often operated to the detriment of the
nation. While it has functioned mightily
against the rise of any aristrocracy— in-
tellectual, financial, or political—it has
been impotent (for example) in com-
bating the truly unjust inferior position
of Negroes and Indian.
Jefferson, the father of American
democracy, believed that a natural aris-
tocracy was the safest repository for the
economic and political leadership of our
nation. De Tocqueville stated that our
infatuation with equality led us into

slavery rather than freedom. Emerson,
hardly less a democrat than Jefferson, be-
lieved that "an institution is the length-
ened shadow of one man; all history re-
solves itself into the biography of a few
stout and earnest persons".3
Despite these warnings from our lead-
ing observers and philosophers, the
course of American history has b;en dis-
tinctly conformist. "United we stand,
divided we fall" was the slogan of the
Revolution and the Confederation. Our
politics have almost always been of the
two-party variety, and it is interesting to
note that the one outstanding exception
to this enduring bifurcation (the Popu-
list movement) resulted in more reforms
in a shorter space than at any other time
between 1783 and the New Deal.
Further evidence of our national tradi-
tion of conformity derives from the
"melting pot" myth. America has been
exceedingly slow to assimilate foreign-
born elements. The hundreds of foreign-
language newspapers, and numerous com-
munities of distinct ethnic character are
proof, not of the heterogeneity of the
nation, but of the insularity, homo-
geneity, and social immobility of the
ethnic colloids.
Our laws, which mirror majority
wishes, have been most effective in cre-
ating and enforcing conformity. The
antitrust laws prevent the seizure of great
economic power by the few, as does the
graduated income tax. On the whole,
such power is more desirable than unde-
sirable, for it is the stuff of which great
men are made and great dreams are
effected. It is only the abuse, and not
the existence, of such power that is to
be feared. Outstanding endeavor and ex-
ceptional talent must be nourished by
adequate rewards.
Public schools are a noble idea and
have done considerable good in provid-
ing mass literacy and instructing the
populace in the rudiments of knowledge.
Yet it is proper to question their bene-
ficence. They cannot and do not meet
the needs of those of exceptional intel-
lectual promise. Public schools blunt and
stulify superiority. They promulgate a
syrupy fog of semi-knowledge, frosted
and predigested so as not to inflame the
tender stomachs of the typical pupil. As
Philip Wylie says in Finnley Wren:
"At all the millions of little Ameri-
cans is hurled a gassy empire of data,
uncorrelated, unexplained .... A
thousand thousand false facts and
never a reason .... Some day ....
a healthy race will take our property.
And our epitaph will be "Here lies
America, stillborn in the little red
schoolhouse". "*
We have a long tradition of equaliz-
ing pressures in America. There art-
scores of examples of our historic single-
mindedness, homogeneity, and con-
tentedness wnth mediocrity. The de-
partures from these traditions fairly co-
ruscate as the high points of this great
experiment in popular rule.
With such a background as this, need
we wonder why lack of individualism is
a problem in today's complicated so-
ciety?
The Organization Man and The
Lonely Crowd
"... God must hate the common
people because he made them so
common." 5—Philip Wylie.
We now turn to the contemporary sit-
uation. Two inspired and incisive analyses
have been written and widely read on
the subject, one by a business analyst
and one by a group of sociologists.
William Hollingsworth Whyte, Jr..
author of the former (The Organiza-
tion Man), examines the systemization
and blatant hyperorganization of white-
collar business activities.
David Riesman, principal co-author of
The Lonely Croud, presents a scholarly
discussion of the everywhere-evident lack
of any backbone in the future plans of
the young.
Now, let us examine a possible cause-
and-effect relationship between these two
aspects of intellectual anasthesia. Prob-
ably there would be no organization men
if we were still inner-directed, (as Ries-
man calls the man who knows who he is
and why he exists). Our desires, our am-
bitions, our natural "cussedness" would
chafe under the oppression of organiza-
tion. Bureauaucratization provides an easy
alternative to imagination. Indecision
predicates intellectual cohesion; decisive-
ness precludes it. We have organization
men who are organized from without
because we have not organized men who
are organized from within.
Young people (e.g., college stu-
dents) are complacent, apathetic, drifting
because they have nothing to fight for.
They have no burning passions, no
dreams, no causes, no interests, no con-
victions, no ideals, ideas, or hope. They
are at sea. They are fogbound. But, they
are adjusted!
They are probably better-adjusted than
the television sets they have watched
since infancy, whose electron beams are

through which the adolescent brain is
nourished with passive entertainment.
They are probably better adjusted than
the automobiles that they drove through
youth, surrounded by a chrome-and-steel
amnion-surrogate, their bodies fallow and
unused.
The lives American children lead are
too sheltered, physically and emotionally.
Strong, free-thinking, idealistic adults do
not often grow from hot-house children.
Tom Sawyer and his contemporaries had
much more stimulating, exciting youths
than these youngsters with electromech-
anical brood-hens and carefully-super-
vised (Boy Scouts, etc.) "adventure".
Their imaginations are cloyed with se-
curity. Small wonder that we are raising
a barren generation.
How many kids these days have hob-
bies? Very few—probably far fewer than
most adults suspect. How many are
perplexed when (on a college entrance
questionnaire, or a job application) re-
quested to list "hobbies, interests, activi-
ties, etc."? What variety would we find
in a hundred listings, or a thousand?
These are the other-directed myriads.
These are the cliches incarnate. These
are the protoplasmic robots. These are
our embryonic organization men.
We shall now consider a documented
example of the illth of conformity today.
Illustration—Report of the Foundation
for Research on Human Behavior
The Foundation for Research on
Human Behavior, an autonomous research
group staffed partly by University of
Michigan personnel and located on the
campus in Ann Arbor, has synopsized its
studies concerning the need of organiza-
tions for creative talent in a 46-page
booklet entitled "Creativity and Con-
formity". This volume contains invalu-
able data and findings. For illustrative
purposes, a brief resume and comment
on certain of these is desirable.
For the sake of precision and clarity,
we should first introduce a definition of
conformity.
Conformity is not uniformity. What-
ever intelligence, simplicity, or conven-
ience—in fact, any rational reason—dic-
tates, is not conformity, no matter how
universal or conventional the conse-
quences. Conformity arises only when
we allow irrational or unreasonable
pressures to influence our behavior—when
we are led by another, in negation to
ourselves.6
We may conform in four ways. Two
types of conformity arise in persons who
have their own opinions: the "passive"
type who succumbs through lack of con-
fidence, and the "expedient" type, who
continues to think that he is right but
strings along with the group anyway,
because it is easier than arguing. Then
there are two types of conformists who
have no opinions of their own: the
"cognitive" type who agrees with the
group because he thinks they furnish the
most likely answer, and the "belliger-
ent" type who always assumes a position
diametrically opposite that of the group.7
Further, conformity and individualism
never exist as mutually-exclusive abso-
lutes. It is as impossible to be a complete
conformist as is it to be a complete indi-
vidual. Like any other human traits,
these are statistically distributed.
Psychological tests have been devised
to assess these traits. There are several;
we shall describe one, as an example.
The subjects are seated at panels where
they cannot see one another, but can
see a centrally-located screen. The ex-
perimenter asks questions which the
subjects are to answer by throwing a
switch in front of him. The questions
may be "factual-logical" (vocabulary,
number-series completion), perceptual
(optical illusions), or general attitude-
and-opinion questions. In front of each
subject, on his switch panel, are some
colored lights that he has been told will
indicate the choice of other members of
the group. They do not, however. The
experimenter controls all the lights. He
can exert "group pressures" on his sub-
jects by turning on the lights in such
a way that they think highly improbable
answers are really correct, since "every-
one else" chose them. The experimenter
alone knows what each subject really
chose.
Female college sophomores do most
poorly (amongst the groups tested) on
this test. They conform to the wrong
answers 56y2 percent of the time. Their
male counterparts conformed 26 percent.
Senior engineering students conformed
22 percent, while research scientists did
best, with only 16 percent conformity to
the wrong "group" answers.
Interesting correlations were found
during the tests. Nonconformity, it
seems, correlates with intelligence, ego
strength, masculinity, dominance, and
ascendancy. Non-conformers also scored
highly in social acuity—ability to under-
stand others.
During the research of the Founda-
tion, a precious example of how group
pressures work to prevent outstanding
performance in industry was discovered.
In the pressing room of a certain textile
manufacturer, a standard production rate
of 50 pieces per hour was in force.
Work in excess of this amount was to be
paid at a bonus rate. A new girl was
hired and put to work at the pressing
tables in the midst of a busy department.
After a few days on the job, she attained
and then surpassed the 50 mark. A haz-
ing process known as "scapegoating" be-
gan at once. Her co-workers tipped her
work off the table, among other harass-
ment^. The girl's rate sagged to about
45. Shortly afterward, management sep-
arated the members of the work group,
and the new girl continued, working
alone. Her rate rose to above 90 within
a week and stabilized there.
Groups punish those who deviate.
This axiom is well known by anyone
with a spark of individualism in him.
(Fortunately, the same individualism that
perpetrates the societal sanction shields
the deviate.) Experimental proof of this
is reported in "Creativity and Conform-
ity"." Scientists formed discussion
groups of subjects, three of whom were
insiders, planted by the researchers. One
of the plants was instructed to conform
to the majority opinion in his discussion
group. The second was to take a con-
trary position and adhere to it. The third
was instructed to start out with a dis-
senting opinion, but let the group "press-
ure" him into conforming during the
course of the discussion.
Upon completion of the discussion,
the groups were to select committees—
an executive committee to make policies
for the group, and a correspondence com-
mittee to handle some miscellaneous un-

TECHNOLOGY
Here at last is an article that makes the funda-
mentals of transistors clear and understand-
able.
by DAVID C. BESTE
I
n the late 1940's, a new word was
introduced to the vocabulary of scien-
tists. This word was semiconductor. This
word has since led to others such as
semiconductor diode and transistor.
Today, many people have heard about
semiconductors and transistors. They
know that transistors take the place of
radio tubes. They know that they are
small and rugged, requiring no warm-
up time and little power. Few people
know, however, the principle of opera-
tion of a semiconductor. This article is

Figure I. Cubic crystalline structure with
the atoms at the corners of the cubes.
intended to describe the principle of
operation of a semiconductor, and in par-
ticular to describe the use of a semi-
conductor as an amplifier.
Basic Principles
Experiments such as X-ray diffraction
show that all good conductors (metals)
and all semiconductors (elements such
as silicon and germanium) have a crystal-
line structure. By crystalline is meant
that the atoms are held together in an
ordered array. One of the most common
crystalline structures is the cubic structure
in which the atoms can be pictured as
being at the corners of a series of cubes.
This is shown in Figure 1.
According to classical theory, each
atom is composed of a number of posi-
tive charges surrounded by an equal
number of electrons in orbit. Most of
these orbits are close to the positive
charges (nucleus). A certain definite
number (constant for a particular type
of atom) of these electrons are in an
orbit farther from the nucleus than all
others. These outermost electrons are
called valence electrons. They are the
ones which determine the electrical and
chemical properties of the atom.
If we now examine semiconductors
we find that they all appear in the same
column of the periodic table and have
four valence electrons. Since all semi-
conductors are essentially alike in chem-
ical and electrical properties, we will
only consider silicon.
Silicon atoms combine to form a
crystal. This crystal is held together by
the valence electrons which are shared
between two atoms in what is called a
"covalent bond". This is pictured in
Figure 2, where each line represents a
valence electron.
Each silicon atom (more precisely—

ion) has a net positive charge of 4, but
since for each ion in the crystal there
is an average of four electrons nearby,
the atoms show no net charge. If one of
these electrons could in some way be
removed, the atom would be left with a
net positive charge. Similarly, if one
electron were added, the atom would
exhibit a net negative charge.
The Junction Diode
If we connect a battery across a silicon
crystal, we find that no current flows.
The reason that no current flows is that
the valence electrons (i.e. the ones that
must move in order to have a current
flow) are all held tightly in their bond.
If we now add an impurity (about one
part in ten million) such as arsenic or
antimony which has five valence elec-
trons, we find that the semiconductor is
now capable of carrying current. The rea-
son for this is that only four of its val-
ence electrons are held in covalent bonds.
The extra electron, however, will move
when a voltage is applied because it is
held only loosely to the impurity. The
reason that it is held is that if it were to
leave, the impurity would be left with \
net positive charge which would attract
the electron. This force of attraction,
however, is much less than the force

holding the covalent bonds. Figure 3
illustrates the semiconductor with a pen-
tavalent impurity.
When a battery is connected across the
crystal, the electron is attracted to the
positive terminal and enters the positive
terminal of the battery. At the same time
an electron leaves the negative terminal
of the battery and enters the crystal.
Thus, a current is maintained through
the semiconductor. This pentavalent im-
purity semiconductor is called an N-type
semiconductor.
If instead of a pentavalent impurity,
one adds a trivalent impurity such as
aluminum, one finds that current will
again flow when a voltage is applied
across the crystal. The reason for this is
that one of the covalent bonds is now
incomplete and there remains what is
called a "hole" in the crystal. This is
pictured in Figure 4.

Figure 4. If aluminum is added to the
silicon crystal there are not enough
electrons to complete one of the cova-
lent bonds.
When a battery is now connected as
in Figure 5a an electron from a bond
just to the right of the "hole" moves
to the "hole" and fills it, thereby leaving
a "hole" in the position it had just left.
This is shown in Figure 5b.
This process continues until the "hole"
gets to the negative terminal where it is
filled by an electron from the battery. As
this happens, an electron leaves a bond
on the left and enters the positive term-
inal of the battery. This creates another
"hole". Thus a current flows through
the semiconductor. This is called a P-
type semiconductor. In future reference
to P-type semiconductors, we will con-
sider only the "hole" movement rather
than the more complicated electron "hole"
movement just considered.
We now have two types of semicon-

ductors. The N-type is formed when a
pentavalent impurity is added (electrons
are the current carriers). The P-type is
formed when a trivalent impurity is ad-
ded to the silicon ("holes" are its current
carriers).
In both the N-type and P-type semi-
conductors, the electrons and "holes"
respectively are moving around at random
even when there is no voltage across the
crystal. When the excess electron moves
away from the pentavalent impurity the
impurity is left with a net positive
charge. Similarly, when a "hole" moves
away from a trivalent impurity, the im-
purity is left with a net negative charge.
When no voltage is applied the total mass
of the N or P type semiconductors do
not show any charge.
If we now place an N-type semicon-
ductor next to a P-type semiconductor
we have a situation as pictured in Fig-
ure 6. In the N-type (N region) we have
fixed in position positive charges due
to impurity atoms and the unused (inco-
valent bonds) valence electrons which
are free to move. In the P-type (P
region) we have fixed negative charges
and free "holes".
If we now connect a voltage source as
shown in Figure 7 (the positive term-
inal connected to the N region and the
negative terminal connected to the P
region) we find that no current flows.
The reason for this is that in the N
region the free electrons are pulled to-
ward the positive terminal, but in moving
to the left they leave a net positive
charge on the right side of the N region.

PROJECT PROPOSAL
Copy No. m of n copies
To: WRA, ARS, SEC, NIHSAC, Lin-
coln Lavatory, Air Force ROTC, and
other interested agencies and individuals.
From: R. U. Onetoo
Subject: Project Turnabout—An effective
ICBM defense.
The difficulties to be overcome in pro-
viding an effective and reliable, active
AICBM system are well known. These
difficulties have led to several proposed
systems that border on the impractical,
either because of excessive cost, excessive
research and development time, unde-
sirable side effects, or all three together.
The object of this memo is to describe
a promising AICBM technique that is
more practical. There are a few diffi-
culties, but these should be surmountable
with a modest R and D effort.
The basic idea of this technique,
which we shall call the "turnabout" tech-
nique, is quite simple. Consider a large
array of rigidly fixed rocket engines uni-
formly distributed in a band around the
earth's equator, all pointed tangent to
the earth's surface, parallel to, and in
the same direction as, the equator. When
an incoming enemy warhead is detected,
these rocket engines are all turned on.
This applies a great torque to the earth
about its axis, and accelerates its rota-
tion. By control of the thrust, the earth
can be made to rotate 180° between the
time of detection and the time of im-
pact. The missile would therefore land
on the enemy's own territories, and con-
tribute to his own destruction.
In the following paragraphs are ex-
hibited representative system parameters
and design problems of a turnabout sys-
tem. Assume that 1,000 seconds (16.7
minutes) are available between detection
and impact. Detailed calculations are giv-
en in Appendix I.
1. Acceleration and Force Required.
For simplicity, we assume a constant an-
gular acceleration a. Then angular dis-
placement (0) at the end of t seconds
is 0 = at2/2. For 0=x, t= 1,000
sec., we find a = 6.28X'06 radian
sec2. The torque required to impart this
acceleration to the earth is 6.12 X 1()3''
dyne-cm. Dividing this by the radius of
the earth to find the required tangential
force, we find 9.6 X 1030 dynes or about
2 X 10" pounds of thrust. This could
be provided by using 1019 rocket engines
of two megapounds thrust each.
2. System Cost. We follow the usual
AICBM practice of measuring the system
cost in units of the gross national product
(GNP). At present the U. S. GNP is
only about S400 billion per year, but it
has been estimated that it will soon reach
Si,000 billion per year so we shall as-
sume 1 GNP = $1,000 billion =510'-'.
Research should bring the cost of one
rocket to 10 cents, which would bring
the system cost to only one million
GNP's.
3. Personnel and Production Require-
ments. The total population of the earth
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


is 3X 109 but it would be unrealistic to
assume that more than 1 X 10" would
be available for production of the rockets.
This leads to a quota of 1010 rockets per
worker. This means that to produce them
in a working year (3,000 hrs. or 107 sec.)
a rate of 1,000 two-megapound rockets
per sec. must be maintained. With mod-
ern technological advances this will soon
be possible.
4. Fuel Consumption. If we assume a
relatively high-performance rocket fuel,
such as liquid hydrogen with a liquid
fluorine oxidizer, having a specific im-
pulse of about 400 pound of fuel con-
sumed p&gt;er second, we find a fuel con-
sumption rate of about one metric ton
per second per megapound thrust. To
operate the two-megapound rocket en-
gines for 1,000 seconds therefore re-
quires about 2 X 1028 grams of fuel.
Inasmuch as this is over three times the
mass of the earth, it is obvious that
some new exotic fuel will have to be
developed.
5. Miniaturization problem. The total
surface area of the earth is about
5X10SI ft.2, but the band around the
equator in which the rockets would be
mounted will not be more than 1/5 of
this area, or about 1013 ft.2 The mount-
DECEMBER, I960
ing density then would be 10,000 rockets
per square foot. This could be accomp-
lished by reducing the size of the rockets
to one cubic foot and stacking them
10,000 deep.
6. Side Effects. The principle side
effects stem from the angular velocity w
acquired by the earth's rotating 180°.
For t= 1,000 sec, „&gt; = 6.28 X 10"3
radians per sec. The radial acceleration
(centrifugal force) needed to keep an
object on the surface of the earth in
tropic temperature latitudes is T = RM-
= 25,000 cm/sec.2 This reduces to
T=l g. at 87.8° latitude or 170 miles
from the poles. This means that most
loose objects on the surface of the earth,
such as vehicles, personnel, buildings,
the oceans, several hundred miles of the
earth's crust, etc., would have a tendency
to depart equal to 25 times the force of
gravity. However, the tangential velosity
at the surface at this point would be
R(o = 25/sec, or 3.6 times the escape
velocity, so there would be very little
danger of this material's falling back
down. It is probable that this side effect
would be distinctly adverse to the enemy.
Indeed, whether or not his warhead
would survive the barrage of debris, to
fall back to where his country had been
is quite academic. Of course it is nec-
essary to the population of the United
States and her allies that we take meas-
ures against the side effect, but this is
easilly accomplished by sinking large
shafts to the center of the earth's axis
of rotat.on, and excavating a large
cylindrical refuge chamber along the
axis. Having a radius of 170 miles the
maximum force of gravity on the walls
of the cylinder would be 1 g. The cham-
ber could easily be made air-tight and
fitted wrth air Jocks at fhe ent
shafts.
7. Immediate Research Program In
view of the obvious efficiency of the turn-
about system, it would be advisable to
initiate an immediate research and de-
velopment program on which the final
design could be based. The problems
to be overcome, such as rocket engine
mountings to withstand 25 g's., construc-
tion techniques for the escape shafts and
refuge cylinder, etc., are clearly solu-
able if a sufficiently intense develop-
mental program is undertaken We
therefore, propose the immediate found-
ing of the following preliminary devel-
opment program.

It should be noted that the prelim-

unusually low fraction for the purpose
involved. r

ROOM 128-H
Every engineer will be interested in this new
report on salaries and offers given to Michi-
gan's latest crop of engineers.
By J. G. YOUNG, Director-
Engineering Placement Service
The overall market for our engineer-
ing graduates continued to improve
this year. With approximately the same
number of graduates available as last
year, both salaries and recruiting activity
reflected a substantial increase in demand.
The most intense demand was noted in
the research and development areas, as
indicated by the increasing differentials
paid for high scholarship and advanced
degrees, but requirements in the design
and application areas were also strong
as evidenced by increases in comparison
with last year. Aeronautical requirements
of the BS level, however, did not in-
crease, evidently as a result of the con-
version from airframes to missiles. Oppor-
tunities for training-type summer jobs
were up substantially in most industries,
and salaries for such jobs also in-
creased.
In spite of the increased demand,
student interest and effort in finding em-
ployment also appeared to increase. This
was evidenced by a substantial increase
in the amount of campus interviewing
and plant visits, and in an unprecedent-
ed number of compliments from employ-
ers concerning the conduct and prepared-
ness of students in their interviewing
and negotiations.
Three trends in the types of positions
accepted were also noteworthy. The first
was a reversal of the trend to the West
Coast in favor of the Midwest, pro
reflecting a reduction in the numbers re-
quired by the aircraft industry. The
second was a large increase in the pro-
portion of students starting on training
programs instead of direct assignments
to specific functional activities. The third
was a substantial increase in the propor-
tion starting with medium-sized, rather
than large, organizations.
The following paragraphs present semi-
detailed placement data for the year to-
gether with comments indicating some
of the more significant trends. More de-
tailed breakdowns of much of this infor-
mation may be obtained from the Place-
ment Office.

ent decrease of 2% in PhD salaries
probably indicates only that the number
of acceptances reported is too small to
significantly determine the trend.

to be the result of employers reporting

Solid opportunities with solid state devices
A big part of Western Electric's job is to manufacture tbe
miniature "new arts" products that are changing the science
of communications. It's a job which offers you a challeng-
ing career—a chance to plan new methods of mass produc-
ing ever-improving kinds of transistors, ferrite devices,
diodes, special purpose electron tubes, etc.
You'll be with a company that is expanding rapidly in
this field. At present our Allentown and Laureldale, Pa.,
plants are devoted exclusively to making electron devices,
and a big new plant is under construction in Kansas City.
The needs of the Bell Telephone System for these products
are increasing daily and will multiply enormously with the
introduction of Electronic Central Office switching now
nearing trial operation.
These devices are changing the scene at all our manu-
facturing plants as they go into the startling new com-
munications products developed by our associates at Bell
Telephone Laboratories. From microwave transmission
equipment to submarine cable amplifiers, our products call
for creative production engineering, installation planning,
and merchandising methods. Our job for the Bell System
and the U.S. government has grown to the point where we
are now one of the nation's 'Top 11" in industrial sales.
And your chance to play an important part in our future
growth is solid!
Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, industrial, civil and
chemical engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, and busi-
ness majors. For more information, get your copy of Consider a Career
at Western Electric from your Placement Officer. Or write College

Come along with this Technic writer as he visits
a large chemical factory to find out what engi-
neers are doing "on the job"!
Four hundred tons of sulfuric acid
per day! Forty tons of nitric acid
per day! Those basic chemicals are just
two of the many products of the Everett,
Massachusetts plant of Monsanto Chem-
ical Company. This plant specializes in
heavy industrial chemicals including the
mineral acids, but it also produces a
variety of other products such as resins
and bleach. I recently had the privilege
of visiting this plant.
I made this visit for many reasons.
Having driven by the huge complex many
times, I was curious about the processes
which went on in it and about the prod-
ucts which flowed from it. More import-
ant, however, was my desire to gain a
first hand look at industry, the engineers'
role in industry, and managements' out-
look toward engineers. In addition, after
studying chemical reaction from a the-
oretical and laboratory viewpoint, I
wanted to see how the same reaction is
carried out in industry where not only
scientific but also financial considerations
are of importance.
My visit began at the office of the

Employer-Employee Relations
I was surprised to see how personal
the relations between the firm and its
employees are. Every year a performance
review report is made out for each em-
ployee. The report is filled out by the
employee's immediate supervisor. It is
then reviewed by the person next up the
ladder of administration. The five-page
report includes such items as the work
given to the employee and the results
which he achieved. Much of the report
is made out during or after a discussion
between the subject of the report and
his supervisor. This man-to-man talk ac-
complishes much for the company and
the employee. The employee gains from
the discussion by being given the right
to voice his feelings toward himself and
toward the firm. This helps to promote
better understanding between the two
parties and allows a better appraisal of
the subordinate. The company, by satis-
fying the employee, gains in efficiency
and in increased enthusiasm from the
employee.
A particularly interesting section of
the report is the "Development Plan".
The plan is framed jointly by the em-
ployee and the supervisor during the
interview. It consists of general and
specific recommendations for the em-
ployee. These recommendations may be
of a large variety. As an example, for
an engineer the problem may be that he-
is becoming interested only in technical
subjects. The accompanying recommenda-
tion may be to read non-technical maga-
zines, e.g. Time, Life, etc., to broaden

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&amp;WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt &amp; Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you do?—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can flourish.
For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,
Engineering Department, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft,
East Hartford 8, Connecticut.

At P&amp;WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab-
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused
on the development of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this live mock-up
of a reactor, nuclear scientists and engineers can
determine critical mass, material reactivity coefficients,
control effectiveness and other reactor parameters.

Representative of electronic aids functioning for P&amp;WA
engineers is this on-site data recording center which
can provide automatically recorded and computed
data simultaneously with the testing of an engine. This
equipment is capable of recording 1,200 different
values per second.

Studies of solar energy collection and liquid and vapor
power cycles typify P&amp;WA's research in advanced
space auxiliary power systems. Analytical and Experi-
mental Engineers work together in such programs to
establish and test basic concepts.

Chemical Engineering students are better able to understand the engineer's
role in industry when they visit a chemical plant. Here they watch air being
passed between thin sheets of plastic.
his activities and interest. By this system
the employee helps himself and helps
the company.
Mr. Kozacka then went on to tell me
about the engineers' role in the plant,
and about the plant in general.
The engineers are substantially on
their own in determining and carrying
out the methods which they use to
solve the problems arising in their work.
Most of the more experienced engineers
handle a particular aspect of the whole
plant, such as safety. The younger en-
gineers are assigned to specific projects
which grow in complexity and importance
as the experience of the engineer grows.
Occasionally a young engineer with a
large amount of potential is assigned to
a very important project. This is done
because he will not know the problems
which have stumped more experienced
engineers associated with the project. He
is starting out with a clean slate. This
type of brainstorming was used to good
advantage at this plant about two years
ago. At that time one of the major oper-
ations in the plant was operating un-
successfully. After many attempted solu-
tions had failed, the problem was given
to a very recent graduate of the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology. He suc-
cessfully solved the problem after much
hard work.
This young engineer is a good example
of industry's new crop of technical talent.
He joined Monsanto as an engineer at
Everett a little over two years ago. He
showed great promise when he was first
hired. At Everett, he did much in the
way of solving production engineering
problems. As his successes gained notice
he was given more responsibility and
more benefits. He is now working at
Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis,
and if present prediction proves to ne
correct, he has a fine future ahead of him.
As you can see, the plan of giving
engineers projects helps both the com-
pany and the engineer. It allows the
engineer to show what he can do and
allows the company to gain from the
increased output of the engineer.
My visit with the plant manager gave
me the overall impression that relations
between supervisor)' personnel and sub-
ordinate personnel are on a friendly
basis. This personal contact is an asset
to all who are associated with it—the
engineers, the technicians, the managers,
and the company.
After my visit with the plant manager
I was taken on a tour of the plant itself.
It covers 160 acres, about 80 of which
are "cultivated", that is, have facilities
upon them. It employs about 800 workers,
32 of which are engineers. About one-
half of these engineers are in admin-
istrative positions.
Sulfuric Acid Production
One of the major facilities of the
plant is the sulfuric acid production
operation. It produces about 400 tons of
H,SO, per day. The process begins in
Louisiana, where molten sulfur direct
from mining by the Frasch Process, is
put aboard tankers. The tankers take the
sulfur to New Haven, Connecticut. Here,
Monsanto has a large tank farm. The
sulfur, still in the molten state, is trans-
ferred to a costal barge. The barge goes
from New Haven to Everett, Massa-
chusetts. At Everett the sulfur is placed
in large tanks to await use. The tanb
are heated and well insulated in order
to keep the sulfur molten. For the re-
turn trip, sulfuric acid is placed in a
second set of tanks in the barge. The
barge takes the acid to New Haven, from
whence it is distributed.
The transportation of molten sulfur
is a comparatively new innovation. Un-
til a few years ago the sulfur was brought
from Louisiana in powder form. This
meant that before it could be used, it
had to be melted. This would appear to
be a small cost, but when tons of sulfur
must be melted each day, this cost gains
importance.
The molten sulfur, together with air
which has been dryed and cleaned, is
introduced into the first sulfur burner.
This burner is about three stories high.
In the burner the sulfur combines with
the oxygen in the air to form sulfur
dioxide. This operation is exothermic so
that the sulfur has to be brought up to
its ignition point by an oil fire and then
the operation creates excess heat.
After the process the gases are very
hot. They are cooled by passing them
through a boiler in which steam is formed.
This steam is then used to provide heat
for other operations in the plant.
Then, the sulfur dioxide goes to an-
other reactor. In this reactor the sulfur
dioxide is reacted with more oxygen in
the air to form sulfur trioxide. This
reaction takes place very slowly under
normal conditions. In order to speed
the reaction, a catalyst is used. The cat-
alyst presently used in most sulfuric acid
plants, including this one, is vanadium
pentoxide. The exact action of the cata-
lyst is unknown, but it has been postu-
lated that the catalyst provides a large
surface area upon which the reaction can
take place. Like the first reaction, this
reaction is exothermic, hence the hot
gases are again sent through a boiler to
produce steam and to cool the gases.
Since sulfur trioxide is the anhydride
of sulfuric acid, the next step in the
process is hydration. At Everett, the
sulfur trioxide is introduced into a large
absorption tower. In the absorption
tower is concentrated sulfuric acid. When
the trioxide combines with the acid,
oleum or fuming sulfuric acid is formed.
Some of this oleum is taken from the
processing tower, but most of it is

tion of and consequential reaction with
water. The concentrated acid is then
drawn off and diluted to the desired
strength.
Nitric Acid Plant
The next operation that I visited was
the nitric acid facility. The raw materials
for this process are liquid ammonia and
air. The ammonia is produced by the
Haber process (direct combination of
nitrogen and hydrogen) and brought to
Everett in tank cars. The air is com-
pressed by four huge compressors and
then cleaned. Vaporized ammonia and
the clean compressed air is introduced
into a reaction chamber. The chamber
contains a platinum screen which acts as
a catalyst. The reaction takes place at a
temperature of about 900 degrees Cen-
tigrade. Water is also produced in the
reaction, hence, the product is dilute
nitric acid. This dilute acid is concentrat-
ed or diluted to the desired strength.
Much of it is made into mixed acid, a
mixture of concentrated sulfuric and
nitric acids.
The plant makes a variety of products
in addition to the sulfuric and nitric acid.
Part of the sulfur dioxide made in the
sulfuric acid process is diverted to the
production of sodium bisulfate. An-
other product made here is aluminum
sulfate which is formed by the action of
sulfuric acid on bauxite. Some synthetic
resins are produced also. One prod-
uct made at Everett is produced nowhere
else. This is the solid bleach used in
such products as "Beads o Bleach" and
"Bleach Tabs". This bleach is about 90
per cent chlorine—the highest percent-
age now obtainable in usable solid form.
A tremendous supply of raw materials
is needed to produce the chemicals. The
molten sulfur and liquid ammonia have
already been mentioned. From the Carib-
bean, solar salt is brought by freighter
to Everett. Solar salt is left after evapor-
ation of salt water by the sun. Bauxite is
imported from Surinam. The bauxite,
which is chemical grade, is used to sup-
ply aluminum for the aluminum sulfate.
Everett has an advantage over inland
plants because it has deep-water harbor
facilities. The plant dock can take ships
which draw up to twenty-seven feet.
A great deal of steam is needed to
provide heat for the operations of the
plant. This heat is provided by the sul-
furic acid operation and by a large steam
plant. The steam plant is equipped with
enormous gas-fired boilers.
Quality Control Laboratory
Another supporting facility for the
plant is the quality control laboratory. No
research is done in this laboratory; all
research for Monsanto takes place in
their research center in St. Louis, Mis-
souri. The laboratory is in charge of all
quality control for the Everett plant.
Constant analysis is necessary to insure
quality products. Production in each
facility of the plant must be carefully in-
spected at set intervals. This constant
quality control keeps a good size labora-
tory busy. Like most industrial labora-
tories, this one is immaculate. One
surprising thing that especially impressed
me about the laboratory was its method
of preventing reactions to take place
among disposed wastes. Each bottle for
disposal is color-coded with colored tags.
Every color represents a type of chem-
ical. This insures that two incompatible
wastes will not be allowed to react.
In order to provide cooling for the
plant, a large amount of cool water is
needed. The water which circulates
through the plant's facilities is fresh
water. It flows in a closed system of pipes,
and is cooled by water from the Mystic
River. The river water is impure. This
causes corrosion, but replacing the corrod-
ed pipe and equipment, is much cheaper
than using city water. Also, by using the
pure water to do most of the cooling, a
great deal of corrosion is prevented.
Another problem is air pollution. This
problem is under control at Everett, al-
though occasionally there is a perceptible
amount of pollution. Monsanto has spent
a considerable amount in lessening the
pollution from the plant. A recent instal-
lation to treat the waste gases from one
operation cost a quarter of a million
dollars.
Safety is extremely important at the
plant. The personnel director, Mr. Robert
A. Ginivan, who is also an engineer,
estimated that about one-half of the
capital investment in the plant went to
provide safety. One of the senior engi-
neers is in charge of safety. The plant has
a very good safety record. In fact, it is
not unusual for the plant to go several
years without a lost-man-hour accident.
As all large chemical and petroleum
plants, the Everett works runs twenty-four
hours per day. Therefore, maintenance
becomes a problem. For general clean-
ing and repairing, the sulfuric acid fa-
cility is shut down about once a year.
The nitric acid operation must be stopped
approximately every week-and-a-half to
allow a change in the catalyst which is
then cleaned and reused. If an operation
is in need of emergency repair, a tempo-
rary repair is made so that the plant can
go on producing until its scheduled
shutdown. This is especially true of the
large operations such as the sulfuric acid
facility.
I feel that I accomplished my objec-
tives in visiting the plant. I received a
good look at industry and at engineering.
Much of what I saw is aiding me to bet-
ter understand my courses and how these
courses help the engineer when he goes
into industry. I strongly urge any en-
gineering student, especially freshmen
and sophomores, to take advantage of
any opportunity to visit a plant. I en-
joyed my trip and learned much from
it. I am sure that you will say the same-
thing if you take "a first hand look at
industry".

AND
RESEARCH
Edited by CHARLES MASSER
Michigan Education &amp; Research
This month Michigan-Education and
Research touches many unknown hap-
penings that occur every day at this
university. Our subjects range from how
currents behave in Lake Michigan to a
discussion of University of Michigan
students using electronic computers in
their homework problems.
Education Must Include
Humanities
Education today can neglect neither
humanities nor technology, according to
Algo D. Henderson, University of Mich-
igan professor of higher education. Pro-
fessor Henderson addressed 10 college
and university administrators from nine
foreign countries attending a three-week
Seminar on University Administration in
the U. S. He said, "Both general and
occupational education should be includ-
ed for every college and university stu-
dent. The answer relates back to our
belief in the kind of education that a
free man in a democratic society should
possess.
"The need of every individual for
literacy is now universally recognized.
The parent who has received some edu-
cation ordinarily desires his children to
advance to a better occupation than he
has had. In the U. S., training for occu-
pation has long been recognized as a
function of the public school and univer-
sity, although the apprenticeship method
is still widely relied upon for additional
or specialized training.
"Persons who have had some of these
advantages in our comprehensive high
schools, on becoming parents, desire their
children to go to college. Education, in-
cluding higher education, is clearly one
of the essential ingredients within our
rising standard of living shared by all
the people."
Henderson asserted, "Citizens in a
democratic society today have responsi-
bilities that far exceed those of earlier
generations. Communication and trans-
portation have brought the peoples of
the world much closer together. Today a
citizen needs to have a cultural back-
ground that will enable him to make wise
choices relating to the great issues of the
world. Thus, education at increasingly
higher levels is becoming essential as a
prerequisite for effective citizenship."
He pointed out that society obviously
benefits by having competent physiciaas,
historians and engineers, skilled organ-
izers and administrators, cultured par-
ents, teachers, and citizens. "We in the
U. S. are getting one additional percep-
tion of the role of higher education,"
Henderson stated. "This role is the cul-
tivation of our human resources. As a
nation we are encouraging young people
to attend college or university because we
need to enlarge their capacities for ser-
vice. We are building larger and stronger
universities because we are convinced
that it is in the national interest to do so."
Regulation of Body Temperatures
Studied
Madeline M. Fusco (Ph.D.), instructor
in physiology at the U-M Medical Center,
is investigating one of the elusive myster-
ies of human life: the way the body
regulates its own temperature. So far
science cannot pinpoint the mechanisms
which control heat production and heat
loss in the body, nor give a precise pic-
ture of how these mechanisms work. The
secret appears to lie mainly within the
hypothalamus, a small region deep inside
the brain which seems to function as the
body's "thermostat."
34
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


some sort of "thermostat which maintains
body temperature within very close toler-
ances. It governs those bodily activities
which maintain a delicate balance be-
tween heat production and heat loss."
If body temperature goes up, the hypo-
thalamus triggers a whole pattern of
responses—sweating, rapid breathing,
increased blood flow to the body's surface
—to discard heat from the body. If the
temperature drops, the hypothalamus
turns up the human "furnace" that con-
verts food into heat; it reduces blood
flow to the surface and starts muscles
shivering to create still more heat, the
U-M researcher explains.
A net work of nerves provides living
temperature detectors throughout the
body. They respond to changes in the
internal and surface temperatures, and
carry this information to the hypothala-
mus which then orders the necessary
adjustments.
Working with research animals, Dr.
Fusco can send bogus signals of temper-
ature change into the hypothalamus by
means of delicate electrodes. A "warm"
signal makes a dog relax, grow drowsy
and pant. He then starts losing heat and
his body temperature drops.
Conversely, a "cold" signal starts him
shivering. He curls into a tight furry
ball and his blood flow to the skin de-
creases to conserve heat. His actual body
temperature then begins to rise.
Dr. Fusco's future investigations will
seek answers to three major questions:
How, she wants to know, does the
hypothalamus control these heat re-
sponses? How sensitive is the body "ther-
mostat" to changes? And what is the
interaction between the deep body and
skin temperatures in the overall regula-
tion of body temperature. Information
along these lines may help doctors inter-
pret and control fever and the other ab-
normalities of body temperature which
are important symptoms of disease.
Behavior of Currents in
Lake Michigan
Lake Michigan currents dip some 15
miles into Little Traverse Bay, Univer-
sity of Michigan researchers have found.
Responding to wind direction and ve-
locity, the water moves from one-tenth
to one and one-half miles per hour,
either toward Petoskey or Charlevoix.
These are some of the findings in work
being carried on this summer by the
Great Lakes Research Division (GLRD)
of the University's Institute of Science
and Technology as part of a many-faceted
scientific investigation of the lakes ex-
pected to take a number of years.
Direction and speed of the currents
is determined by current poles and
drogues which are dropped overboard
from the Division's boat and then are
picked up after a fixed time limit. Com-
parison of their orgination with their
pickup point provides data on current
movement.
Prof. John C. Ayers, U-M oceano-
grapher, says Little Traverse currents had
been thought to dip in only about seven
miles, but under a strong west wind
doubled that distance. The U-M re-
searchers also put a fluorescent dye in
the water to measure the bay's mixing
characteristics. They examine the bay's
bottom by taking core samples.
Work on the bay is underway now in
part to help prepare for industry moving
into that area. Determination of currents
and other characteristics will show where
wastes dumped into the bay will go.
However, the main reason for the
GLRD's interest in the lakes is that
these inland seas, with an area of nearly
100,000 square miles and a shoreline of
about 8,000 miles, are the world's largest
source of drinking water.
"We must know in the immediate
years ahead all we can about the Great
Lakes if we are to preserve their value
and supply the ever increasing demands
placed upon them," says Prof. David C.
Chandler, GLRD director.
The GLRD's first major research work
began in 1954 when the characteristics
and currents of Lake Huron were inves-
tigated. Similar work was done in Lake
Michigan in 1955. Studies in Grand
Traverse Bay and elsewhere continued
the research.
Ahead lie such projects as core samp-
lings from the deepest parts of the lakes
to study their geologic history, intensive
work on the waters' plant and animal
life, and collection of data on inflow of
water from rainfall, and lakes and
rivers.

University of Michigan researchers are busy measuring Lake Michigan currents. Current direction and speed
are determined by charting movements of current poles like the one being thrown overboard.

MIT '59) is investigating the theoretical requirements of
an automated design system for advanced cryotron-circuit
computers.
HE WORKS WITH A NEW DIMENSION
IN COMPUTER DESIGN
Thin film cryotrons may make possible computers of small
size and truly prodigious speeds.
The speeds of today's computers are limited mainly by
device switching times. Speeds of cryotron computers would
be limited mainly by signal propagation times between
devices.
Automation of Logical Circuits. Edward Sussenguth is
studying methods of design which will reduce the distance
between devices to a minimum. He hopes to work these
methods into a completely automatic design system.
Ultimately, then, the systems designer would specify his
needs in terms of Boolean equations and feed them into a
computer. The computer would (a) design the logical cir-
cuits specified by the equations, (b) translate the logical
circuits into statements describing the interconnections,
(c) from the interconnections, position the devices in an
optimal fashion, (d) from this configuration, print out the
masks to be used in the evaporation process by which
these circuits are made.
This is a big order, but Edward Sussenguth and his col-
leagues have already made significant progress. Their work
may well have a profound effect on computer systems in
the coming years.
Orientation: the future. One of the exciting things about
computer development is this orientation towards the
future. If a man wants to match his personal growth with
the growth of computer systems, his future can be virtually
unlimited. This is true of all the fields associated with com-
puter systems—research, development, manufacturing,
programming, marketing. The IBM representative will be

ductivity and originality; to connect indi-
vidualism, creativity, and progress.
Establishing the Necessity of
Individualism to Progress
We have little to fear from lack of
individualism in the superficialities of
the social order. Dress, habits, and
mannerisms are of minimal importance,
whether similar or differing. Indeed,
some case can be set forth for greater
standardization in these areas. For exam-
ple, if students were required to wear
identical uniforms, many socio-economic
problems that hamper education might
be alleviated.
In the significant area of thought, how-
ever, a divergence amongst persons be-
comes a necessary adjunct to progress.
This will be proved later. Humans are
indisputably differently-endowed with
mental ability, with respect to both in-
tensity and hue. Progress depends heavily
on the fullest exercise of these idiosyn-
cratic traits.
When we draw upon a colloquium of
minds for guidance in the shaping of
progress, we inevitably achieve only a
statistical average of the talents repre-
sented by the contributors. Any especial
genius is commingled with the mediocre,
which invariably constitutes the bulk of
any group. Results of group activity, be
they ideas, plans, works of art, or sys-
tems of law, suffer from the ruthless lev-
elling of disparate capabilities.
We are speaking not only of formal
brain-pools, such as boards of directors,
legislatures, and research teams. We
include also the informal thought-collec-
tives—audiences, subscribers, listeners,
fans—every target of a mass-communica-
tion device. All produce results, all in-
stigate progress, only as a huge median-
being, of mediocre tastes, ordinary talent,
and common dreams.
The denegation of individual endeavor
in favor of "groupthink" has another
consequence, which is perhaps more defer-
ent to progress than this levelling. Its
effects cannot be predicted statistically,
however, so we shall merely theorize on
its extent and nature.
The cohesion of minds characteristic
of highly conformal groups tends to
blunt the individual ego. There is some
evidence in the biography of great men
that egotism is an ingredient, perhaps
of the nature of a catalyst, triggering and
sustaining the acid-attack of man upon
problem. When a higher loyalty diverts
even a part of this tonic, the insatiable
need of the hero to establish his own
heroism flags. A man who draws ideas
from one source and touches them up
slightly before passing them along to the
next in line has accomplished nothing he
can call his own. His is the position of
the assembly-line riveter, who feels no
empathy toward the completed auto.
We do not speak of competition or the
struggle for security, for these phenom-
ena occur, metamorphosed, under every
social setup, including communism. What
we describe is the need of individual re-
sponsibility, individual possibility. Pro-
gress would seem to require that a man
be sufficiently free from constraints—
rules, bosses, conventions, assembly-line
impersonality, and conferences—so that
he can identify with his work and believe
that his work will identify him.
A definition of progress is in order.
We construe the term in somewhat the
way a philosopher construes "truth".
Progress is any force, activity, or event
that militates toward a more ideal human
situation.
Now we prove the necessity for a
divergence of ideas in order to effect
progress. "A more ideal human situa-
tion" is subjective; therefore, so is the
notion of progress, which is defined in
terms of the former. Change is implicit
in the definition of progress, too—" . . .
progress . . . militates toward ..."
Therefore, some mind must conceive a
more ideal situation in order for that
situation to exist; a divergence of opin-
ion is an a priori requirement of progress.
A similar relation arises in thermody-
namics, where two different temperature
levels are an a priori requirement for the
existence of heat, which is defined as the
flow of thermal energy from one tempera-
ture to another.
Illustration—The Brainstorming
Technique
Brainstorming is a well-known tech-
nique which strives to achieve creativity
in a group. The brainstorming group is
given a problem and instructed to suggest
any idea, no matter how far-fetched, that
might bear on the solution to the prob-
lem. Participants are supposed to use the
ideas offered by others as starting points
for contributions of their own, and the
total number of suggestions, it is theor-
ized, will snowball. Further, no sugges-
tion may be critized, lest the participants
become inhibited or apply judicial think-
ing (an evil) before speaking.
Brainstorming is the spawn of Madison
Avenue, perhaps the "organization" cap-
ital of the world. In the advertising busi-
ness, this technique has been successful
—for reasons which, oddly enough, sup-
port the contention that creativity is
the realm of the individual thinker.
First, advertising must be palatable to
large groups to accomplish its objectives.
Therefore, the larger the group that
conceives it, the more minds through
which it is strained, the greater the like-
lihood of widespread appeal. Truly crea-
tive work must be original and contrary,
even unpopular, to accomplish its ends,
as we have seen. Second, much of adver-
tising must be designed to establish very
trivial, if extant, differences between com-
peting products. It must persuade, not
instruct. Persuasion and pressure are
prerogatives of the group. Thus, "group-
think" triumphs—an excellent method
for finding mediocre solutions to trivia!
problems.
Analysis—"Creative Thinking"
In a paper entitled "Creative Think-
ing—Introduction and Summary", Mr.
Fred Olsen, Vice-President for Research
and Development, Olin Industries, re-
ports on the fruits of an investigation of
U/2 years' duration by a team of dis-
tinguished researchers whom he assem-
bled to study creativity.
This group included Dr. L. L. Thurs-
tone, of the Psychmetric Laboratory of
the University of Chicago, as psycholo-
gist; Dr. F. S. C. Northrop of Yale as
philosopher (to examine creativity from
the standpoint of epistemology); Nobel
laureate physicist Arthur H. Compton;
composer-pianist Dr. Ernst Kronek;
painter John Ferren; and poet Richard
Wilbur, of the Harvard English depart-
ment.
Their work culminated in a three-day
symposium at the Skytop Club in the
Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. Five
major elements seemed to appear as
consistent elements in the creativity
problem:
38
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the recognition of the disturbing ele-
ment. Until the irritant or the "thorn in
the flesh" has been discovered, there is
no beginning of any creative act.
*'2) If our objective is, then, the
promotion of creativity, we have first to
find some ways of stimulating our sensi-
bility to dissatisfaction. We must de-
velop greater acuteness of this sensitivity
to things which are irritants, to things
which do not fall in line with our ac-
cepted generalizations. We must become
an ardent lover of what Gerard Manley
Hopkins says in his poem "Pied Beauty":
glory be to God for . . . all things
counter,
original, spare, strange.'
"3) . . . it is equally necessary, as
Arthur Compton says, 'to do something
about it when you are irritated, . . .
irritation is the first, but the decision to
do something about it, that is the essence
of creativity.
"4) When the problem has been for-
mulated, and the decision made deter-
minedly to go after its solution, then
there comes the crucial step which some
creative thinkers have spoken of as in-
spiration.
"5) ... a man can know his experi-
ences as items of thought: he has sensa-
tions, he invents a relationship between
sensations, and then invents another." 10
These statements seem only indirectly
to suggest individualism as a significant
contributor to creativity. Possibly this
is only because this term did not occur
to the researchers, for individualism
seems to run "through and through" in
these thoughts. Indeed, if we take the
liberty of interpreting "recognition of
the disturbing elment" as dissastifaction
with the status quo, and "stimulation of
our sensibility to dissatisfaction" as an
awakening of nonconformity, these find-
ings coincide perfectly with our hypoth-
esis. (Individualism and nonconformity
are not synonyms, but they are so nearly
coincident concepts that our other nec-
«sary assumptions eclipse these semantic
differences.)
Statist Politics Versus Minority Rights
"We must ask whether, as we look
hack over the ground we have traversed,
we can discern any master tendency at
work, and we do descry a tendency toward
standardization and uniformity, a tend-
ency which is the correlative and oppo-
site of the tendency towards differentia-
lion and diversity which we have found
to be the mark of growth of civilizations"
—Arnold Toynbee.
All governments are inimical to indi-
vidualism.
"Government of the people, by the
people, for the people" is also govern-
ment of the consensus, by the consensus,
for the consensus. The ideas which be-
come law in a democracy are the ideas
which are most widely held. Our
laws tend to fix these ideas permanently.
Popular government is an inbreeder of
custom and thought. Democratic govern-
ments pass many bad laws, and they
repeal few. (I do not question but that
democracy is more desirable than the
alternatives, however—I merely think
we should examine all institutions peri-
odically).
For example, the provincials who con-
trol the legislature of Michigan peren-
nially jeopardize the position of excel-
lence held by this University by their
parsimonious handling of her financial
needs. Perhaps the lawmakers are justi-
fied in spending t he money where the
immediate benefits will be more wide-
spread. But there is another possible
solution to the problem of 'the greatest
good to the largest number for the long-
est time." To suggest such a thing may
be heresy, but a case can be made for the
justice of minority supremacy. Consider
the conversation of Raskolnikov and
Razumihin in Dostoyevsky's Crime and
Punishment. In seeking a rationale for
his axe-slaying of the pawnbroker
Alyona Ivanova, Raskolnikov speaks elo-
quently for the special rights of superior
individuals.
"There is, if you recall, a suggestion
that these are certain persons who can
. . . that is, not precisely are able to,
but have a perfect right to commit
breaches of morality and crimes, and
that the law is not for them. . . .
"... extraordinary men have a right
to commit any crime and to transgress
the law in any way, just because they
are extraordinary.
"I maintain that if the discoveries of
Newton and Kepler could not have been
made known except by the sacrifice of
one, a dozen, a hundred or more men,
Newton would have had the right,
would indeed have been duty-bound . . .
to eliminate the dozen or the hundred
men for the sake of making his discover-
ies known to the whole of humanity.
"In short, I maintain that all great
men or even men a little out of the
common, that is to say capable of giving
some new word, must from their very
nature be criminals—more or less, of
course. Otherwise it's hard for them to
get out of the common rut; and to re-
main in the common rut is what they
can't submit to, from their very nature
again, and to my mind ought not, indeed,
to submit to it.
"I only believe that men are in gen-
eral divided by a law of nature into
two categories, inferior (ordinary), that
is to say, material that serves only to
reproduce its own kind, and men who
have the gift or talent to utter a new
word.
"The first category, generally speak-
ing, are men conservative in tempera-
ment and law-abiding; they live under
control and love to be controlled. . . .
". . . People with new ideas, people
with the faintest capacity for saying
something new, are extremely few in
number, extraordinarily so in fact. One
thing only is clear, that the appearance
of all these grades of men must follow
with unfailing regularity some law of
nature.""
If Raskolnikov is correct, then an
entirely different ethical code applies to
the superior individual, the nonconform-
ist. He who thinks differently, who is
capable of benefitting mankind through
his superiority, is morally hound to
minority rights and duties which trans-
cent commonness and conformity. To
such individuals, no government but
anarchy applies—not democracy, even
less socialism or communism.
Jefferson's natural aristocracy hypothe-
sis is borne out by this.
Illustration—The Federal Trade
Commission
Occasionally a voice of reason arises
from the depths of the Federal bureau-
cracy, marking an individual who has
not capitulated to the heavy seas of
conformity and the tyranny of red tape.
Lowell B. Mason, who has spent more
than a decade as a Federal Trade Com-
missioner, is one such individual.
Mason's book, The Language of
Dissent, analyses the dangers inherent
in our topheavy system of government.
According to Mason, topheavy govern-
ment, "Big Brother in Washington", is
as much a threat to individualism and
individual liberty as are the threats aris-
ing in the private sphere:
"The most effective way peaceful
totalitarianism can be achieved in the
U. S. is through complete government
control of the common everyday acts of
all people.

SOLID-STATE TRAVELING-WAVE MASERS
A recent addition to the field of low-noise devices is the maser (microwave amplifica-
tion by the stimulated emission of radiation), which can generate or amplify very high
frequency signals while adding but little noise.
The development of the solid-state ruby maser has permitted great advances to be
made in the design of low-noise receivers for radar and radio telescope systems. The first
ruby maser was operated at the University of Michigan Willow Run Laboratories and con-
sisted of a ruby crystal in a resonant cavity operating near 10 kilomegacycles. Since
that time a great deal of research has been carried on both at the Willow Run Laboratories
and in the Electron Physics Laboratory of the Department of Electrical Engineering on such
items as broadband cavities, room-temperature masers, low-magnetic-field masers, and
traveling-wave masers.
The solid-state maser generally requires a large magnetic field and operates at liquid
helium temperatures (4.5° Kelvin) and hence its use is restricted to cases where these in-
conveniences are justified. Present research is involved with the development of closed,
compact, cryogenic systems and the use of superconductor electromagnets. Further re-
search on solid-state materials can be expected to result in low-noise masers operating in
the millimeter wavelength regions.
In the figure above a laboratory experimental system is shown in which a traveling-
wave maser has been operated at 10 kilomegacycles. Gains of 30 db and instantaneous
bandwidths of 35 megacycles can be achieved in this system. The traveling-wave maser can
be turned over several hundred megacycles in the 10 kilomegacycle region.

Figure 7. When the voltage source is
connected as shown, holes move to the
right and free electrons to the left in
their respective regions.
This positive charge exerts an attractive
force on the electrons. Thus, the more
the electrons move to the left, the greater
the force pulling them to the right.
Similarly, in the P region the "holes"
move toward the negative terminal but
in doing so, they leave a net negative
charge on the left side of the P region.
Thus the more the "holes" move to the
right, the greater the force pulling them
to the left. When the voltage is con-
nected as in Figure 7 we say the junc-
tion is "reverse biased".
If the voltages are now reversed as in
Figure 8, we find that current flows. This
is because the free electrons in the N
region move away from the negative
terminal and cross the junction into the
P region. In the P region they combine
with a "hole" to complete a covalent
bond. When this occurs a bond near the
positive terminal breaks down and an
electron leaves the crystal. The resulting
"hole" moves away from the positive
terminal and toward the junction where
it is in turn filled by an electron. This
is a case of "forward bias".
It is now obvious that a junction of N
and P type semiconductors is capable of
rectification (i.e., allowing current to
pass in one direction only). A junction
of this type is called a junction diode or
semiconductor diode.

The Junction Transistor
It has been observed that when a P-
type semiconductor and an N-type semi-
conductor are placed together a current
will flow through the combination only if
a voltage source is connected in such a
way that the positive terminal is con-
nected to the P-type and the negative
terminal to the N-type. The electrons in
this case flow from the N to the P-type.
If we now place three semiconductors
together as shown in Figure 9, we know
that electrons can flow across the junc-
tions only in the direction from the N to
the P-type.
If we now connect two voltage sources
as shown in Figure 10, we see that cur-
rent can flow only in circuit A.
If, however, the P-type semiconductor
is made very thin and the voltage sources
are again connected as in Figure 10, we

tors together, electrons flow across

find that only about 5% of the electrons
crossing from the left hand N region
into the P region combine with "holes".
The remaining 95% of the electrons are
attracted by the positive voltage of term-
inal (3) and pass through the P region
before they have a chance to combine
with "holes".
In the arrangement of Figure 10, elec-
trons can easily flow from the left hand
N region into the P region. This means
that the resistance of terminal (2) is
low. We saw above that about 95% of
the electrons entering the semiconductor
at terminal (1) passed through into the
right hand N region. This occurred as
long as terminal (3) was positive regard-
less of the resistance in circuit B. There-
fore, we can place a large resistance in
circuit B without changing anything else.
We see now that a current passing
through a small resistance is transferred
into almost the same current passing
through a much larger resistance. Thus,

this device is called a transfer-resistor or
more commonly a transistor.
The Transistor Amplifier
It is now easy to explain how a trans-
istor can be used as an amplifier. Sup-
pose the circuit is set up as in Figure
11. An alternating voltage (£) to be
amplified is placed in circuit (A). In
circuit (B) is placed a large resistor. Now
a small change in £ will cause a large
change in the current (since the input
resistance is small). About 95% of this
change in current will flow through R
causing a much larger change in voltage
across R than occurred acoss E in the
first place.
As an example, suppose the input
resistance equals one ohm and the resist-
ance in the output circuit (R2) equals
100 ohms. Then using Ohm's law:
E
I , a change in the input voltage
R
(E) of one volt would produce a change

in the input current of
l\v
Now 95% of this one amp (or .95 amp)
flows thru R2. Again using Ohm's law.
now in the form E = IR, we see that the
voltage across R2 is .95 X l0° = 95V.
Thus we have amplified our signal by
a factor of 95.

this manner, the transistor will act as
an amplifier.

INDIVIDUALISM &amp; NATURAL SUPERIORITY
(Continued from page 39)
"Today, a series of administrative court
decisions are being quietly built up in the
world of commerce which may provide
future precedents for tyranny in every
phase of a man's life.
"We need a serious and perhaps tire-
some audit to see how many liberties are
being carried on our books as assets
which we really do not own any more. . .
"Mason's law holds that bureaucracy
will arrogate to itself all power available
under a statute in spite of the limitations
against tyranny in the Constitution. . .
This it will do quietly and unobtrusively,
through decisions at the lowest rung of
the judicial ladder where the issue seldom
meets the public eye." 12
This is only one example of the way
that government erodes individualism.
For a more lucid example, consider the
Chinese people, who have been reduced
to the level of a giant ant colony by
statist policies.
We do not choose to discuss the rela-
tive merits of political systems—merely
to indicate that a minimal dose of govern-
ment seems to give the most favorable
clime for individualism.
Illustration—"The Ebb Tide of
Freedom 1:!
Professor William Kilpatrick of Co-
lumbia University, a leader of progressive
education, wrote, "A fundamental re-
making of our economic system seems to
be in order so that men will no longer
be compelled to work against each other
but may rather be encouraged and per-
mitted—and if a recalcitrant minority
requires it, be compelled—to cooperate
for the common good."
Apparently Prof. Kilpatrick does not
esteem personal liberty to be essential to
"the common good".
This philosophy may have been what
Benjamin Franklin was referring to
when he said, "Those who would give
up liberty for a little temporary security
deserve neither liberty nor security".
From time to time we have made
references to the natural differences be-
tween individuals. This inference seems
well-supported by omnipresent facts.
However, there is another natural phe-
nomenon, which has recently been dis-
covered and is yet little-known, which
might make an amusing, if irrelevant,
closing to this paper—or is it so irrele-
vant?
Individualism as a Cosmic Law
Individualism is a cosmic law. Rela-
tivity has junked the Newtonian con-
cept of the Universe as a mechanistic
system of causes and effects, action and
reaction. Bodies, it seems, behave due to
their own properties, and not because of
environmental circumstances.
This is the essence of these sentences
from the chapter entitled, "The Abolition
of Force" in Bertrand Russell's book.
The ABC of Relativity:
"It has been customary for people to
draw arguments from the laws of nature
as to what we ought to do. Such argu
ments seem to me a mistake: to imitate
nature may be merely slavish. But if na-
ture, as portrayed by Einstein, is to be
our model, it would seem that the anarch-
ists will have the best of the argument.
The physical universe is orderly, not
because there is a central government,
but because every body minds its own
business.""

Company as a major source for main rotor
thrust bearings, generally regarded as among
the critical engine components, and one of the
most exacting to produce. Each ball bearing is
custom-built and rigorously tested. Tolerances
are held to the millionths-of-an-inch.
P&amp;WA turned to Fafnir because of Fafnir"s
long experience in the design and development
of aircraft bearings. Fafnir established an air-
craft division thirty years ago, the first In the
industry, and through it, is keeping pace with
the revolutionary changes in aircraft design.

MICHIGAN - EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
(Continued from page 35)
Computing at Michigan
Prof. Donald L. Kafi, University of
Michigan engineering faculty member,
is enthusiastic about the early introduc-
tion of computer techniques to engin-
eering students.
For the past year, the U-M has car-
ried out a project in this area, and in
some cases, the problems were too ele-
mentary for the students. Some 60 U-M
courses, including 49 in engineering, used
the computer as a regular part of course
instruction in the past year, Prof. Katz
explained.
The U-M experience shows that with
a very small amount of computer back-
ground, students were able to do the
problems assigned.
Effects of the Computer on
Education
Assistant Prof. Bernard A. Galler, a
research associate in the U-M Comput-
ing Center, believes Computers are effect-
ing the education of both undergradu-
ate and graduate students in the univer-
sities, particularly in the engineering
fields. He said "Recognition of the role
of electronic computers in scientific re-
search and education has led to the use
of these machines even for homework
problems.
"Along with this trend, one sees a rec-
ognition of the need for more mathema-
tics; in partciular, logic and statistics,"
Galler said. "These developments arc
being felt even in the high schools where
teaching of logic and statistics has al-
ready been introduced in many cities."
Galler explained that "there are many
facets to the computer, such as the use
of binary, octal, and hexadecimal number
systems in many computers, the use of
symboloc logic in the design of circuits,
and the growing use of statistical and
numerical analysis methods in the solu-
tion of problems on the computer.
"Some day the computer itself may be
a subject of a course in the high schools,"
Galler said. "Even now it is opening up
new areas of interest which the high
school teacher would do well to learn
about. The computer can serve very well
as a topic of discussion and exploration—
an 'enrichment topic'—for mathematiis
clubs and advanced students."
Prof. Emeritus Alfred H. Lovell of
The University of Michigan died Oct.
27 at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital follow-
ing a brief illness. He was 76.
Former chairman of the Department of

a big FISH in the right-sized STREAM
O
We've been told frequently that engineering graduates are attracted to a
company our size because of an honest and understandable desire to be
"a big fish in a little pond". Perhaps others prefer to think of the future as
the challenge of "swimming up-stream".
We believe that Sikorsky Aircraft is actually the "right-sized stream" for
young engineers who would enjoy diversified, small-group activities, as
well as stature opportunities in a field that is not limited nor professionally
confining. Sikorsky Aircraft is the company which pioneered the modern
helicopter; and our field today is recognized as one of the broadest and most
challenging in the entire aircraft industry.
Because of this, we can offer stimulating experiences in an ideal environ-
ment. Work associations could include joining an electronic team of twenty
to thirty associates—or—working with a highly selective group of four or
five on interesting problems of radiation, instrumentation, auto pilotage,
automatic stabilization, etc.
And what of your future?
That, of course, involves your own potential for growth. As
a far-sighted company, we're more than willing to help you
meet the challenge of "going up-stream"!

wants—Money. The first person submit-
ting the correct answers, including the
method of solution to the SIX Decem-
ber Technic Teasers, will be given a prize
of five dollars. In the event of a tie, the
earlier postmark will win. If a tie still
exists the winners can split the loot.
All entries must be in by January 5,
1961. All Technic members are excluded
from this contest.
1) A man stakes 1/m of his fortune
on each play of a game whose probability
is y2. He tries again and again, each
time staking 1/m of what he possesses.
After 2n games he has won n times and
lost n times. What is the result?
2) A man has 64 pounds of sand. He
needs only to use only 50 pounds, but
what he uses must be a representative
sample of all the sand. He has a riffle
which splints any amount of sand into
two representative samples of the same
weight. What is the least number of
times he must use the riffle to obtain his
50 pounds of sand?
3) Eight men entered a recent tennis
tournament at Hillcrest. The tournament
was played in 3 consecutive days, one
round a day, and happily no match was
defaulted. The first and second round
matches were stipulated to be two sets
out of three, while the final match was
three sets out of five. A spectator who
was present on all 3 days reported the
following facts:
A) Eggleston never met Haverford.
B) Before play began, Gormley re-
marked to Bancroft, "I see that
we meet in the finals."
c) Chadwick won a set at love but
lost his first match.
D) Altogether 150 games were played,
of which the losers won 43.
E) When the pairings were posted,
Abercrombie said to Devereaux,
"Do you concede, or do you
want to play it out?"
F) On the second day, the first-round
losers played bridge, and the
same table gathered on the third
with Eggleston in place of Aber-
crombie.
G) Bancroft won nine games.
H) Franklin won 37 games.
I) The first score of the tournament
was a service ace by Gormley, at
which Eggleston shouted, "Hey,
I'm not over there!"
Who won the tournament? Whom did
he beat and by what score?
4) A group of heirs divide their heri-
tage as follows: The first takes a dollar
and the Nth part of the remainder, the
second takes 2A dollars and the Nth
part of the remainder, and so on, each
succeeding heir taking a dollar more than
his predecessor and an Nth part of the
new remainder. In this manner the heri-
tage is divided into equal parts. How
many heirs are there, and how much does
each receive?
5) We have three cards that are col-
ored as follows; one has both sides red,
another has both sides white, and the
third has one side red and the other side
white. You reach into a hat holding these
three cards, draw one out and lay it on
the table. You find yourself looking at a
red face. Your roommate offers you a
bet on what the color of the other face
of the card. However, you want to know
the probability of the other face being
red. His roommate didn't know the an-
swer. What is the answer?
6) If a tree 30 inches in diameter has
a notch cut to the center, what is the
volume of the wood removed if the lower
plane of the notch is horizontal and the
upper plane makes an angle of 45 de-
grees with the lower plane? What as-
sumption must be made to do this prob-
lem?

Research Scientists Propose New
Theory for Rusting of Iron
Scientists at the Westinghouse Research
Laboratories have advanced a new basic
explanation for the corrosion of iron—
estimated to waste some $6 billion to
$7 billion per year in the United States
alone. Westingthouse researchers, Dr.
Earl A. Gulbransen and T. P. Copan,
suggest for the first time that the true
culprits are hydrogen ions, or protons—
one of the basic building blocks of
matter.
The hydrogen ions come from water
vapor, which must be present if iron is
to rust to any great extent at room temp-
erature. Their theory suggests that the
tiny hydrogen particles penetrate the iron
and enlarge the sites at which oxygen
normally combines with the metal. This
spreads the reaction throughout the sur-
face of the iron, causing it to rust destruc-
tively.
Until now, a "standard" explanation
for iron corrosion is that it is an electro-
chemical reaction, somewhat similar to
that which occurs in an ordinary battery.
Tiny local areas on the surface of the
metal are assumed to act as plus and
minus electrical terminals under the in-
fluence of an invisible liquid film of
water, generating minute electric currents
that corrode the iron. The new theory
suggests that something more fundamen-
tal takes place in the iron, even though

Edited by CHARLES MASSER
an electrochemical reaction also may be
present.
In a series of experiments that elim-
inated the conditions required for elec-
trochemical reactions, the Westinghouse
scientists reduced the complex rusting
of iron to its simplest atomic processes.
Pure iron wires about as thick as a fine
sewing thread were reacted with oxygen
and water vapor at high temperature-,
(835 degrees Fahrenheit) under closely
controlled, idealized conditions. The re-
sults of the minute-scale corrosion were
studied under an electron microscope
capable of magnifying objects up to
300,000 times.
The scientists report that with dry
oxygen the iron forms a protective oxide
coating from which grow billions of tiny
round oxide whiskers less than one-
millionth of an inch in diameter and
30-millionths of an inch high. Each
whisker grows from a single, specific
growth side on the wire's surface, much
as individual seeds sprout from the
ground into separate plant stems. Then
the wires were reacted under identical
conditions except that water vapor was
substituted for the dry oxygen atmos-
phere.
The moisture produces a startling
change in the oxide surface. From the
When iron is placed in a dry oxygen
atmosphere it forms a protective oxide
coating from which tiny whiskers grow.
Each whisker is less than one-millionth
of an inch in diameter and 30-millionths
of an inch high.

shaped platelets of iron oxide that spread
across the metal surface. Shaped some-
what like blades of grass, they are about
one-millionth of an inch thick, 30-milI-
ionths of an inch wide and 300-millionths
of an inch high. As they grow in size,
they spread more than 50 times in area
over the sites observed for dry oxygen
alone, reaching a density of nearly one
billion per square inch of surface area.
The amount of iron rust they represent is
250 times that which forms when the
water vapor, and the hydrogen ions it
releases, are absent from the reaction.
The experiments by the Westinghouse
scientists show that less than one part
of water vapor in 200 parts of the dry
oxygen atmosphere will cause the blade-
shaped crystals to form. At room temper-
ature this would correspond to a relative
humidity of about three percent.
"We conclude that the hydrogen ions
in the water vapor enlarge the areas of
chemical reaction between the oxygen
and iron and bring about the metal's
greatly increased corrosion," Dr. Gulbran-
sen declared ."At the lower temperatures
at which iron usually rusts, this basic
reaction is masked. Complex corrosion
products are formed and are not stable,
and the corroding metal is often re-
moved from the reaction site. Once such
basic understanding is at hand, we should
be able to do a much better job of con-
trolling corrosion. Already we can iden-
tify two control measures which must be
considered in addition to any electro-
chemical effects that are involved in iron
rusting: Hydrogen must be prevented
from entering the metal, and the growth
of the localized reaction sites must be in-
hibited by the addition of suitable alloy-
ing elements to the iron."
Heat Lamps Aid Space Program
by Simulating Thermal Barrier
The "thermal barrier," a major ob-
stacle to man's successful venture into
space, is being overcome with the aid of
a modern, sophisticated version of the
common light bulb. William F. Hodge,
engineer for General Electric, described
the device as a tubular, pencil-thin quartz
infrared lamp, capable of producing the-
intense concentrations of energy required
to simulate heating conditions which
exist when a space vehicle enters the
earth's atmosphere.
By pre-testing the heat resistance of
materials, structural parts, models or
whole structures of missiles, space

NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. Heat produced in the cylindrical
radiator reaches 3100° F., about a third as hot as the surface of the sun.
vehicles and aircraft, the nation is able
to facilitate its program in these fields.
Temperatures of more than 3000 de-
grees Fahrenheit, about one-third the
temperature of the surface of the sun,
arc- being created by closely arrayed banks
of the tubular lamps in ovcrvoltage
operation.
The fast heating and cooling char-
acteristics and low thermal capacity of
quartz infrared lamps make them "by
far the most satisfactory device" for
thermal barrier simulation.
Temperatures in this work must be
varied rapidly and controlled accurately
to produce the same temperature con-
ditions actual missiles would develop in
passing through various regions of the
earth's atmosphere.
The maximum wattage a quartz lamp
can withstand is determined by the
melting point (about 6100° F.) of the
tungsten filament. Lamps designed for
200 watts per inch, now being used in
thermal barrier simulation, have been
operated successfully for a few seconds at
1000 watts per inch.
Engineers revealed that a new lamp
now under development is designed to
operate at 360 watts per inch but is
capable of operating at as high as 1500
watts per inch for very short periods.
The operating life of quartz infrared
lamps of the type used in aircraft and
missile structure testing recently had been
improved by using platinum lead-in wires.
While oxidation causes the standard seal
with molybdenum lead-in wires, to break
down at 650°F., the new seal will last
for 100 hours or more at temperatures of
around 1500 degrees.
Russians to Warm Arctic
Soviet scientists reportedly have a
plan to defrost the Arctic. The Russians
think it feasible to thaw a northern sea
route through the ice by means of a
space belt of potassium particles which
would act as a giant reflector for the
sun.

the subject will push a button whenever
he thinks he has reached any one of these
five levels. His verbal opinions will be

In initial testing, the subjects will have
no tasks to perform other than to relate
their opinions of what effect the vibra-

however, certain tasks will be assigned.
Accomplishments of those tasks will then
be measured against the subject's earlier
opinions.
Vibrations, produced by a hydraulic
cylinder, will be between 1 and 30
cycles per second and within amplitudes
up to 10 inches at the lowest frequencies

Bendix answers your questions
WILL I BE PUT INTO
A TALENT POOL?
Depending on the company you join, your first assignment can range
from detailing to full participation, as a team member, in solving
a complex major systems problem.
Exactly where you will fit in depends on a number of
things, such as: (1) your ability; (2) the existing
opportunities; and (3) the amount of responsibility
your company is willing to give you.
Some employers actually have a "talent pool"
arrangement, where you will bide your time while
the company "orients" you, or looks you over.
At Bendix, engineers are hired to do specific engineering
jobs. We have long been devoted to the principle of
"maximum skill utilization." Engineers are not placed
in talent pools at Bendix.
We feel that it is wasteful to all concerned when a man
works below his ability and capacity. Ask your Placement
Director about Bendix—where you can build your
career to suit your talents. Arrange for an interview
with a Bendix representative; ask him about your
probable first assignment. You will be surprised at how
completely it can be defined. Or, write to C. A. Cleveland,
The Bendix Corporation, Fisher Building, Detroit 2. Mich..
for general information.

The i-ditot* Pen —
MEANS AND GOALS
A recent crusade by the Michigan Daily has once again brought
the subject of the non-technical education of engineers into the
campus spotlight. Although the quasi-muckraking style of an am-
bitious would-be journalist was the vehicle for this article-editorial
series (The headline "Engineering English Stirs Controversy should
have read "Michigan Daily Stirs Controversy), we do find ourselves
in agreement with one of the two stated premises. In the series
the Daily author has voiced a plea for increased study by engineers
in the humanistic-social science area. At the same time it is strongly
implied that no steps can be made in this direction until the English
departments of the Engineering and L.S.A. colleges have been com-
bined.
We wholeheartedly agree with the argument for increased non-
technical courses for engineers, as evidenced by recent Technic
editorials. However, we do not agree that it necessarily follows
that in order to achieve these goals the two English departments
must be combined. Later this may prove to be an advantageous step
but the important point now is to convince the students, faculty, and
administration of the College of Engineering that a broader educa-
tional foundation for engineering students is highly desirable. At
the present time this conviction does not exist to any degree in the
College of Engineering. This, in itself, is the problem ue face toda).
What many have failed to realize, including the Daily, is that any
attempt to link this problem with certain means of implementation
(i.e.—combining the English departments) is likely to bring un-
favorable results.
Therefore, while reserving judgement on the means, we would
like to reemphasize our attitude towards a broadened educational
base for engineers with this statement from the Humanistic-Social
Research Report of the American Society for Engineering Education:
.... (engineering) students would profit—as pro-
fessional men, as citizens, and as individuals—from a fuller
acquaintance with the resources of the humanities and the
social sciences.
FOUNDATIONS OF FREEDOM
Throughout the semester we have been watching a series ot
threats, charges, and public statements fly back and forth between
Wayne State University and some members of the state legislature.
All of these statements have centered around WSU's decision in
September to lift a 10-year old ban on Communist and other outside
speakers. Most of the statements seem to be the result of a misunder-
standing of just what constitutes the new policy but some of the
statements have resulted from an apparent lack of understanding
of the fundamental reasons behind such a policy.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


will be allowed to spread vicious propaganda advocating the over-
throw of the government. However, WSU President Clarence B.
Hilberry has repeatedly stated that "nothing could be further from
the truth. All the safeguards have been set up to prevent propa-
ganda of any kind being preached." He has also pointed out that
"a Roman Catholic priest would have as much trouble getting to
speak propaganda at Wayne as a Communist would get, and neither
one of them would be allowed to speak." Thus the policy becomes
one of allowing the free flow of ideas but also one of not allowing
any type of propaganda which might undermine our democratic
way of life.
The misunderstanding of what the WSU policy says is under-
standable and forgiveable. It even becomes insignificant beside the
fundamental lack of understanding of democracy that has been
exhibited by some people, including a number of state legislators.
What they fail to realize is that if, in the long run, democracy is to
survive we must allow the free and open debate of all ideas, no
matter how contrary to our own beliefs they may be. Only in so
doing will the falsehoods be separated from the truth.
What is more important, the legislators and others do not under-
stand that once certain limits are placed on the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights, for any reason, the way has been cleared for real
dangers to our democratic system. In an attempt to eliminate some
dangers that may exist in a free, open society the door is opened to
the- much greater dangers of a capitive, closed society. It is the lack
of realization of these facts that is the saddest part of the whole
situation.
FINAL EVALUATION
On the editorial pages of this and the previous seven issues, it
has been our goal to stimulate the thinking of engineers on topics
of importance to them as engineers and/or as individuals. Conse-
quently, the discussion has been centered on such subjects as the
preparation of engineers as men as well as technicians, the role
engineers might play in the developing nations of the world, and a
continual urging of engineers to participate fully in such campus
educational activities as Challenge and the SGC reading program.
To a large extent these efforts have probably not been overly
successful. This is due at least partially to the prevailing concept on
this campus that engineers can not or should not, be concerned or
think about anything other than technically oriented subjects. Our
only hope is that, to some extent, we have aided in obliterating this
false concept.
In any event, this issue marks the change-over point on the
Technic editorial staff. Starting with the next issue, concern for this
page, and we hope for the future of engineers and engineering as
well, becomes the responsibility of Editor-in-Chief-Designate Bryan
R. R. Whipple.

NEW POLYMERS
CHALLENGE RUBBER
Natural rubber has finally yielded to scientific
synthesis. Using the type of polymerization pro-
cesses developed for plastics, the rubber indus-
try is going into large-scale production of new
synthetics.
by BENSON SHAPIRO
The Phillips Chemical Com-
pany's Copolymer Plant near Bor-
ger, Texas, produces 118,500
long tons of synthetic rubber an-
nually. This is enough rubber for
22,100,000 passenger car tires.

Company.
Presently, plants capable of pro-
ducing close to one half billion
pounds of synthetic rubber per year are
being constructed or planned. A new
surge of growth has suddenly come about
in this young expanding industry. The
cause—the stereo specifics.
The stereo specifics are polybutadiene
and polyisoprene. The name stereo speci-
fic is derived from the catalysts used in
the production of the new synthetics.
Earlier Synthetics
Previous synthetics did not resemble
natural rubber. In fact, their properties
were quite different from the tree pro-
duct, necessitating the continued use of
natual rubber in spite of its disadvan-
tages. In contrast, polybutadiene closely
resembles natural rubber, and polyisop-
rene is almost an exact replica of the
natural structure, which is also based on
isoprene.
The first synthetic rubber was invented
in Europe over eighty years ago. This was
merely a laboratory curiosity. It was not
until World War I that a large scale pro-
duction of synthetic rubber came about.
Germany, cut off from its supply of nat-
ural rubber, was forced to resort to syn-
thetics. They used methyl rubber pre-
pared from 2, 3-dimethylbutadiene. This
synthetic, although not possessing good
qualities, served the purpose and proved
that large scale synthesis was possible.
The next developments in the industry
came in the 1930's when numerous types
of synthetics were introduced. Among
these were neoprene, Buna S, Butyl, and
G R-S. These products, many of which
were produced in large quantities in this
country during World War II, had a
variety of properties and a corresponding
variety of uses. But, synthetic rubber
could still not replace natural rubber.
The New Synthetics
Natural rubber was needed because of
its high heat resistance and high resili-
ence, properties which are attributed to its
regular configuration. Both polyisoprene
and polybutadiene exhibit these sam prop-
erties to some degree. The isoprene poly-
mer is, because of its close resemblance
to the natural product, superior to the
butadiene polymer in these properties.
Natural rubber is in many ways an un-
desirable raw material for important large-
scale production. The price of natural
rubber has constantly fluctuated for the
last five years. These fluctuations have
ranged from fifty cents per pound down
to twenty-three and one-half cents per
pound. This has caused many shifts in re-
tail prices, profit, and production. The
properties of natural rubber vary from
season to season, area to area, and even
from tree to tree. Each batch must there-
fore be processed in accordance with its
properties. This restricts the use of large
scale fast moving production processes.
In addition, the natural product is usual-
ly contaminated with dust, bark, and
other foreign matter. Hence, it must un-

and consequently an added cost.
In contrast, the new synthetics possess
many properties which will enable them
to decrease production costs, and con-
sumer prices. The initial marketing price
will be about thirty-five cents per pound.
Once large scale production begins and
better methods are discovered, the price
will probably drop. Since they are pro-
duced under carefully controlled condi-
tions, their properties can easily be stan-
dardized and adjusted to meet require-
ments. Also because of production
methods, the purity can be simply con-
trolled, eliminating undesirable contam-
inators.
From a national security viewpoint,
the greatest disadvantage of natural rub-
ber is the difficulty in securing it. Major
production areas are Southeast Asia and
Liberia. South America also has some
large plantations. During wartime trans-
portation of the rubber from plantation
to American plants presents great prob-
lems. The long supply lines are extreme-
ly vulnerable. This problem caused the
federal government to initiate the syn-
thetic rubber programs of World War
II. The situation has worsened consider-
ably since then because of the unrest in
Southeast Asia. Even in times of relative
peace, we cannot be assured of a contin-
uous supply of rubber as long as we must
depend on unstable nations such as In-
donesia, which produces a large portion
of the world's supply of rubber. The
government therefore has been very
much interested in the production of
good substitutes for natural rubber.
The chemistry and consequently the
production of the stereo-specifics is vast-
ly different from that of the older syn-
thetics. Both of the new products close-
ly resemble the plastic polymers, poly-
ethylene and polybutadiene. The new
synthetics are produced by the use of
complex organometallic catalysts. These
catalysts are hydrocarbons combined with
metallic elements. Each catalyst produces
a specific type of polymer. Those used
for the two rubber polymers are Ziegler-
type or lithuim derived. The mechanism
of these catalysts is still one of natures
closely guarded secrets.
There is more than one type of polysio-
prene. The differences are in the con-
figuration of the molecules. The proper-
ties of the polymers are to a great ex-
tent dependent upon the configuration.
One problem in the production of poly-
isoprene is the difficulty in controlling the
molecular structure. Much research has
been done in this field, but more must be
done before an exact replica of natural
rubber can be synthetically created. For
the present, the very good approxima-
tions must do.
Polyisoprene, the synthetic almost ex-
actly like natural rubber, has many fine
properties. As stated before it has high
resilience and heat resistance. It can be
processed and cured just like natural rub-
ber if it is modified by the addition ol
anti-oxidants, proteins, and fatty acids
which naturally occur in the tree product.
These substances also stabilize the poly-
mer. Polyisoprene is easily processed and
is in general suited to all uses of natural
rubber. In fact, in color and flow charac-
teristics it is superior to the natural pro-
duct.
Polybutadiene is cheaper than polyiso-
prene because its monomer is cheaper.
This, of course, gives the butadiene poly-
mer a definite business advantage. There
is a possibility that Shell Chemical will
be able to produce isoprene monomer
cheap enough to compete with butadiene.
Polybutadiene is difficult to process be-
cause of dryness and poor tack. How-
ever, blending it with natural rubber re-
sults in a mix of satisfactory heat re-
sistance, abrasion resistance and tensile
strength. Tires made of a 50-50 mix of
polybutadiene and natural rubber proved
comparable to those of natural rubber in
all respects. Also, polybutadiene's abra-
sion resistance makes it a good material
for conveyor belts and other such ap-
plication.
Development
Polyisoprene was developed by Good-
rich-Gulf Chemical Company, a com-
pany formed jointly by B. F. Goodrich
Rubber and Gulf Oil to enter the field
of synthetic rubber, in 1954. At about
the same time, Firestone probably de-
veloped a similiar process. Goodrich-
Gulf attempted to patent and more or
less monopolize the process. The Justice
Department sued Goodrich-Gulf on
the grounds that the process had been
developed under government research
grants and therefore was not completely
the property of Goodrich-Gulf. The mat-
ter was finally resolved by having the
company agree to license other manu-
facturers who want to use the process.
The polybutadiene process was brought
forth by Phillips Petroleum at about the

butadiene synthetic rubber.

same time as the polyisoprene one was
developed.
Business Aspects
Nine companies are either operating,
building, or considering building plants
to produce the stereo specifics. The first
companies to announce plans for pro-
duction plants were Phillips and Fire-
stone. Phillips is planning to produce
only polybutadiene. Their Borger, Texas
plant, scheduled to open about this
month, will have a capacity of twenty
thousand long tons per year. Firestone's
plant in Orange, Texas will produce thir-
ty thousand long tons of both synthetics.
It will go on stream next year.
Shell Chemical Company has at this
time the largest stake in the stereo speci-
fics. They surprised the entire industry
when their plant at Torrance, California,
began production of isoprene in 1959.
In addition, Shell is building a plant at
Marietta, Ohio, which will have a capa-
city of 90,000 long tons per year. This
plant, too, will produce only polyiso-
prene.
Other companies with plants under
construction are Goodyear, Goodrich-
Gulf, and American Rubber and Chemi-
cal Company, a combination of twenty-
nine firms with Stauffer Chemical Com-
pany possessing fifty percent. United
States Rubber, General Tire and Rubber,
and Texas-United States, a subsidiary of
both Texaco and United States Rubber,
are considering construction of plants.
Foreign Competition
In addition, Montecatini of Italy is
presently producing another stereospeci-
fic in semi-commercial quantities. The
synthetic, being produced at Farrara, Italy
is an ethylene isopropylene copolymer de-
veloped by Professors Karl Ziegler of
Germany and Giulio Natta of Italy. The
copolymer is produced from monomers
costing only from four to five cents per
pound, and will, therefore, have a defi-
nite price advantage over the other two
stereo specifics.
Russia has also developed a synthetic
rubber which is known to be based on
isoprene. Nothing is known of current
production.
In this country, the most surprising
feature of this new phase of the produc-
tion of synthetics is the tremendous
speed with which so many companies
have entered production. Each plant re-
presents a tremendous investment. But,
as in the chemical industry, the companies
in this industry cannot allow their com-
petitors to gain a research, production or
marketing advantage. In this fast moving
industry, hesitation can lead to financial
disaster. Because of the time lag between
research and large scale production, de-
cisions must be made quickly to prevent
a competitor from cornering the field and
building up an insurmountable advan-
tage.

A description of the remarkable system by
which bats locate objects as tiny as a gnat by
bouncing ultrasonic sounds off them.
by ROLAND SCHAEDIG
A study of the relationship between
the sounds which a bat emits and
its ability to detect objects involves
in interaction of the zoological and
physical sciences. This interaction may
not be as obvious as the influence of bird
flight on the development of the airplane;
however, the successful flight of bats has
wide implications, including the theory
of radar and sonar and the orientation of
blind men. A study of the bat's obstacle
detection will help us to see these in-
teractions more clearly.
In earlier years, zoological study was
greatly concerned with the classification
of the kinds of animals and the origin
of the species. Therefore, as long as bats
existed only as static specimens within
a particular classification, little could be
accomplished toward solving problems
which concern us.
Man's first speculation about bats'
ability to avoid collisions with objects on
a dark night was probably that they pos-
sessed extremely sensitive vision. Bats do
have distinct eyes, but their vision is act-
ually very poor. Proof that their vision
had very little influence on their obstacle
detection had appeared by the 18th cen-
tury. At that time scientists in Europe
found that bats could detect objects with-
out trouble if they were blinded. But if
both ears were tightly plugged, the bats
would strike wire obstacles at random.
No one realized at the time, however,
that there might exist sounds inaudible
to human ears but useful to a bat for ob-
stacle avoidance.
The sinking of the Titanic in 1912
led Sir Hiram S. Maxim to devise a
means by which ships could detect ob-
stacles. His inspiration came from the
study of bats, from which he called atten-
tion to the possibility of bats' use of
sounds inaudible to the human ear. He
proposed sounds of a frequency below
human range, 15 cycles per second,

PROGRESS IN
AUTOMOBILE BRAKES
Great strides have been made in improving the
safety and reliability of automobile brake sys-
tems, but there are still some tough problems
that need to be licked.
by R. CURTIS FISHBACH
The problem of stopping an automo-
bile is, of course, as old as the au-
tomobile itself. Many means of braking
were tried; there was a time when you
could step on the reverse gear of the Mod-
el T to achieve some braking effort.
Fortunately, we have made great strides
in brake design since the days of the
Model T. Today, American automobile-
manufacturers have generally accepted
the internal expanding drum brake for
use on their vehicles. For the most part,
this brake has been extremely reliable,
but during the past few years this brake
has shown an increase in the per cent of
failure. At the same time, more is being
expected of the brakes due to the in-
creased weight and the increased engine
potential of today's cars. Consequently,
we cannot overlook the problems which
Curt Fishbach, a sophomore in
automotive engineering, comes from
South Bend Central High School,
where he participated in debating
and the Science Club. He is treas-
urer of the Engineering Council
and Secretary of the Society of
Automotive Engineers here at U-M.
Last year Curt won the U of M
ASME technical paper contest. This
is his first article to appear in the
Michigan Technic.

are causing the brake failures.
One of the problems encountered in
the present brake system is the uneven
distribution of braking effort needed
while stopping a car. During a stop, an
automobile that normally has a ")l-Alc:&lt;
weight distribution on the front and rear
axles, will change as much as 18^.
giving a 71-29% distribution. Automo
biles are commonly equipped with brakes
giving 60% front, 40% rear braking
effort. It would be much better if a sys-
tem were used whereby the braking effort
would be divided between the front and
rear axles according to the per cent of
weight on each, as it changes during a
stop.
The second and largest problem con-
cerning automobile brakes is the heat
produced by braking. It has been shown
that a 4000 pound car, when stopped
from 60 miles per hour, produces 620
B.T.U.'s of heat, or enough heat to melt
three pounds of cast iron. This heat
comes from the friction between the
brake shoe and the brake drum. The
components of the system must be able
to withstand and dispose of the heat
created.
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
^


Heat can be disposed of in three
ways. The first way is to radiate the
heat to surrounding parts. This, how-
ever, is not advisable because the tires
are nearby and they can't withstand any
further heating. They create enough heat
on their own. A second way of disposing
of heat is to conduct it to surrounding
parts. This also is not advised for the
same reason: the tires don't need the heat,
and the heat would induce extra wear in
the wheel bearings which are also near-
by. The third, and best, way of ridding
brakes of heat is to convert it to the air.
In general, this is the way today's brakes
are cooled. Convection accounts for bet-
ter than 90% of the disposal of heat
from brakes.
It is vital that brake system compo-
nents be able to withstand and dispose of
heat, for too much heat will adversely
affect them. The brake fluid will vaporize
if heated beyond 1100° F., a tempera-
ture easily attainable in many of the
brakes on today's automobiles. Because
a vapor is compressible, the effect the
hydraulic pressure in the system has, is
lost. Also, the vapor can readily escape
through small leaks in the seals in the
system where the fluid cannot.
The brake linings, commonly made of
organic material such as asbestos, wear
quite well at low and moderate tempera-
tures. At high temperatures, above 800°
F., the wear rate can triple and even
quadruple. It does not seem to matter
what type of lining material is used, as
all types have about the same temperature
bound. Linings that have been developed
to withstand higher temperatures have a
coefficient of friction so low that they
are impractical. Thus, it is important to
keep brakes cool to preserve lining life.
Brake drums, the largest principal
parts of brake units, are also adversely
affected by heat. Because of their size and
because they are responsible for con-
verting heat to the air, the heat proper-
ties of brake drums are quite important.
It is also essential that brake drums give
maximum performance, long life, be light
weight, and low in cost. Today's brake
drums are found to maintain a good co-
efficient of friction up to 800°F. Beyond
this point the coefficient of friction falls
off seriously. Since temperatures above
800°F. are often attained while stopping,
most brakes on American cars are prone
to fade.
It is also found that brake drum ex-
pansion comes with rising temperature.
This expansion requires more brake shoe
travel and wheel cylinder displacement.

Technicians in the General Motors Research Laboratories operate a testing de-
vice used for the evaluation of brake lining materials.
The increase in drum diameter also
means less contact between the shoe and
the drum; hence, localized high shoe
temperature and localized high lining
wear. High temperatures also weaken the
drum material structurally, causing the
drum strength to decrease and the metal
to soften and warp.
When selecting a material for brake
drums, there are a number of "heat fac-
tors" to be considered. Mass is one of
the most important, since mass times
specific heat is the thermal capacity of
the drum. Therefore drums must have
enough mass to give a good thermal ca-
pacity. Emissivity, the property of a metal
to radiate heat to the air, is also import-
ant. A large amount of heat dissipated by
radiation makes the entire cooling job
easier.
Surface area and exposure are import-
ant factors when cooling is to be done
by convection. It is best to have as large
a surface area as possible. Finning of
brake drums is also good aid in acquiring
more exposure. Finning can increase the
total drum area by 70%. Shrouding must
also be considered. The amount of air
allowed between the wheel rim and drum
will certainly control how well brakes
are cooled. Better shrouding in today's
wheels and brakes would bring better
cooling.
Good homogeneity of the materials in
brake drums is quite necessary since it
avoids hot spots in the drums and ren-
ders a good flow of heat between the
heat generating and heat dispersing sur-
faces. This can help keep the drum
strong so that it is long lasting and long
wearing. By avoiding hot spots, rigidity
is aided, allowing the drum to hold its
shape even with unequal pressure on it.
Cast iron has met most of these re-
quirements over the years. It has a high
heat storage capacity, high emissivity,
low expansion, high melting point, and
low cost. Aluminum, which has been re-
cently introduced as a brake drum ma-
terial, shows merit in having good heat
conductivity, good homogeneous charac-
teristics, and good convection proper-
ties. Unfortunately, aluminum has a low
heat storage capacity, and is subject to
expansion and softening. Also, aluminum
has a higher initial as well as production
cost.
The most recent new brake drum that
has been tried is the finned aluminum
drum with a cast iron rubbing surface
liner. This combination has, so far,
shown outstanding success as a cool op-
erating brake drum. The concept over-
comes the inherent weakness of alum-
inum, and retains the good features of
both aluminum and cast iron. This de-
sign should soon become the adopted
type of drum.
There are extra aids that could be in-
corporated in automobiles to help in the
cooling problem. Special air ducts to in-

MACHINES THAT SELL
"Iron clerks" are cutting overhead losses and
improving service in the merchandising of count-
less small items. Here is a description of the
mechanisms inside these intriguing devices.
by DAVID PAH
The idea of automatic merchandising
is not new. It is a vending industry
maxim that the first vending machine
was built in 219 B.C. by the Greek inven-
tor, Hero of Alexandria. Its purpose was
to sell holy water to the public. The de-
vice was simplicity itself. It consisted of
a container for the holy water, a valve,
and a lever on a pivot to operate the
valve. When a coin was inserted, it would
roll down a trough, strike the valve's
operating lever, and fall into a collection
bin. The momentary opening of the
valve, due to the coin striking the operat-
ing lever, allowed several spoonfuls of
water to escape. However, it appears that
people just weren't ready to accept such
a revolutionary method of buying holy
water, for no other historical reference to
automatic merchandising is found until
the late eighteenth century. Then, a crude
machine was used by London tobacco
merchants to vend cigars.
It wasn't until 1930, however, that the
refinements, which enabled vending ma-
chines to reach their present importance
in merchandising, began to be made.
These refinements, which were mechani-
cal in nature, preceded and caused re-
finements in application.
Mechanical Refinements
The success of automatic merchan-
dising is directly related to the mechanical
perfection of the vending machinery
used. Therefore, the following develop-
ments were instrumental in the growth
of the vending industry.
The endless chain principle of vend-
ing was the first major improvement.
David Patt is a freshman in
Science Engineering, hailing from
Detroit's Mumford High School.
This is his first article in The
Michigan Tecbnic. While in high
school, Dave was a member of the
Math Club, and his other interests
are astronautics and nuclear engi-
neering.

In a device incorporating this principle,
containers or open faced boxes are at-
tached to two parallel endless chains;
the products to be vended are inserted
in the containers. When the machine is
operated, the chain moves the product
into position and it is ejected or "vend-
ed."
The gravity vender was another in-
novation. In this device, the products to
be vended are stacked one on top of the
other in a manner resembling the cups
in a paper cup dispenser. When the ma-
chine is operated, the lowermost item is
ejected, thus allowing the next product
to fall into vending position.
The development of coin changers.
which accepted nickels, dimes, and quar-
ters, was one of the most important con-
tributions to the success of vending ma-
chines. Along with coin changers came
the development of electrical actuation
and temperature control systems.
The next step was the incorporation of
some combination of these devices into
one machine. Today's vending machines
employ multiple endless chains or a
number of gravity feed columns to give
customers a wide choice of products.
They use coin changers and electrical
actuation to increase convenience, and
they may also provide heating or refrig-
eration when necessary.
Applications
These mechanical improvements led
to more widespread applications. Today,
vending machines have reached the point
where they sell practically all "nuisance

machines. Sales are excellent even though the unit is near the dormitory cafeteria.
items" (over $2,000,000,000 worth in
1959). A "nuisance item" is a good
which is physically small, has a long
shelf life, and costs between five and fifty
cents. Because of their small cost, they re-
quire a relatively large percentage of time
and labor to sell. Hence, the term "nui-
sance item." They include such familiar
things as cigarettes, candy, gum, soft
drinks, and so forth.
Recently, vending machines have be-
gun to sell things other than nuisance
items. Such products as hot sandwiches,
pastries, ice cream, hot coffee, and hot
canned foods (stew, soup, beans, chili,
etc.) have been successfully vended.
One interesting example of the ex-
panding use of vending machines can be
found at the University of Kansas. The
University is operating an automatic food
service facility next to a conventional
dormitory lunchroom. The automatic in-
stallation is similar in quality and econ-
omy to the manual installation, but is
much more convenient.
These new applications are indicative
of the future. And this is where the real
interest in automatic merchandising is
found
The Future
I have mentioned before that the suc-
cess of automatic merchandising is re-
lated to the mechanical perfection of the
vending equipment used. Therefore, re-
cent technical advancements in the vend-
ing industry provide a basis for predict-
ing the future of automatic merchandis-
ing.

be largely responsible for any future suc-
cess of automatic merchandising. This is
an automatic currency changer. The
changer accepts and changes any United
States SI or $5 bill. It rejects bills which
are counterfeit, foreign, or of wrong de-
nomination. The machine distinguishes
between bills electronically (operational
details are unavailable due to secrecy)
and is built in modular form for ease of
maintenance. The changer is controlled
by a miniaturized computer which co-
ordinates the operation of its five mod-
ules. The modules are: 1) currency-ac-
cept circuitry; 2) currency discrimina-
tion circuitry; 3) coin accept mechanism;
4) coin payout; 5) currency payout.
Another important device is the to-
talizer. This operates in conjuction with
the coin changer as follows. A customer
deposits a sum of money in the changer
and proceeds to make purchases from
the vending installation. The totalizer
would add up the purchases and visually
indicate the credit balance. When the
customer has finished buying, the totalizer
will compute his change and the cur-
rency changer will pay it.
For two months last summer, a proto-
type installation of changer and totalizer
operated at Macy's in New York City.
The machine sold men's shorts and T-
shirts and provided 18 sizes of each.
Electronic and microwave cooking
units, which will allow complete meals
to be prepared and served by machines,
are under development. The food will
be quick-frozen and stored in the ma-
chine. When operated, the machine will
transfer the food to a cooking comp.irt-
ment where microwaves will heat it to
the perfect temperature. The food will
then be served, all in twenty or thirty
seconds.
Future applications of vending ma-
chines will make extensive use of the
above developments. Consequently, it
will be possible to sell almost any type
of retail good. We will no doubt see au-
tomatic restaurants, super markets, movie
theaters, and department stores.
Last month, The Vendo Company
opened an experimental automatic drive-
in restaurant and grocery store in Kan-
sas City. The restaurant consists of a
kitchen where the majority of the food
items are to be prepared; a small man-
ual service counter, which operates from
11 A.M. to 11 P.M.; and the vending
machinery, which operates continuously.
Attendants who work the 12-hour shift
in the kitchen make change (the currency

changer is not being used here) and
stock the vending machines. The restau-
rant section sells fresh coffee, milk, ice
cream, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and
other drive-in items.
The grocery section consists of ma-
chines which sell items in three tempera-
ture ranges: frozen, chilled (34 degrees),
and room temperature. The following
items are typical of the products offered.
1) Frozen items—Bulk ice cream,
frozen vegetables, frozen pastries, frozen
fruits and fruit juices, and frozen meat
dishes.
2) Chilled items—Dairy products in-
cluding eggs, milk, butter, cheese, and
lemonade; meat products as bacon and
bologna.
3) Room temperature items—Bakery
selections such as bread, rolls, and crack-
ers; staples as sugar, flour, soap, and
coffee; and a wide selection of canned
goods.
The purpose of this experimental in-
stallation is to evaluate public acceptance
of automatic merchandising, methods of
operation and packaging, and economic
feasibility.
Benefits of Automatic Merchandising
The benfits offered by any automatic
merchandising facility are: convenience
in 24-hour service and speed of service;
a large saving in payroll costs (an auto-
matic installation requires a much small-
er number of personnel than an equiva-
lent manual facility); extreme flexi-
bility in that vending machines can easily
be added or removed; maximum use of
space; and small inventories due to the
large product capacity of the machines.
For the consumer these benefits will
mean decreased prices and increased con-
venience. This alone is enough to insure
the success of automatic merchandising.

STU'S EXPLAINING HOW MACHINES WILL
SOME DAY "OUTTALK" PEOPLE
"Stu" Smith graduated from Southern Cal
with a powerful yen for excitement. His kind of
excitement—Engineering.
He got what he bargained for (and a little
more) when he joined Pacific Telephone. One of
Stu's early assignments was to find out how
existing Long Distance networks could be used
to pipeline high speed "conversations" between
computers in distant cities.
The fact that he did a fine job did not go
unnoticed.
Today, four years after starting his tele-
phone career, Senior Engineer Stuart Smith
heads a staff of people responsible for telegraph
and data transmission engineering in the huge
Los Angeles area. As a pioneer in this new data
transmission field Stu predicts data processing
machines will some day do more Long Distance
"talking" than people.
Stu contacted 12 other companies before join-
ing Pacific Telephone. "I don't think there's any
limit to where a man can go in the telephone
business today. Of course, this isn't the place for
a guy looking for a soft touch. A man gets all the
opportunity he can handle right from the start.
He's limited only by how well and how fast he
can cut it."

Every semester, the men chosen for Tau Beta

prepare essays on some non-technical aspect of
engineering. This essay was selected as out-
standing among those submitted by last fall's
pledge class.
by ARLEIGH DAGENIAS
When defining the responsibilities of
a citizen today in the United
States, the status of the world must be
taken into consideration; for a citizen to-
day is no longer just a citizen of his
country, he is a citizen of the world.
In the past, a good citizen was judged
as one who fulfils his ob'igation to vote,
to serve on the jury, to spend his allotted
time in the service of his country, and in
general to be a fairly respectable individ-
ual. Today fulfilling these obligations is
not enough, for citizenship in our times
involves a whole kaleidoscope of intang-
ibles. These new varied aspects of a cit-
izen's responsibility have gradually evol-
ved with the international proximity of
nations and individuals of the present
day. The clarity of this citizen's respon-
sibility to the world is obvious at every
moment of every day as the impact of
world events has its effect upon each in-
dividual citizen's life; and in reverse, the
citizen's ability to fulfill his obligations
will have a direct effect on the world of
today, as well as the world of tomorrow.
These areas of responsibility for an
American citizen of our times touch on
many facets of his life. Of first concern
is an active participation in working for
a peaceful world. It is not the responsi-
bility of our governing officials alone
to strive for peace, but the burden falls
upon all of us. A tolerance for and an
attempt to understand the nations of the
world are obligations of the responsible
citizen. Knowledge of foreign countries,
their customs, beliefs and ways of life
is a first step toward understanding. A
tolerance of different opinions, prefer-
ences, and attitudes will break the way
for friendship. A genuine interest and
concern on the part of the citizen for the
welfare of people in all areas of the
world will serve as a foundation for more
active participation. Those who travel
are obliged to carry with them at all
times an open mind and the constant
thought that they are representatives of
their country and all American citizens
will be judged through them. Supporting
the instruments of truth and freedom in
the world is the responsibility of all citi-
zens. The broad scope of these activities
is constantly growing in many forms,
from freedom broadcasts to finding
homes for the refugee population of the
world.
In the home it is necessary that citi-
zens who arc parents raise their children
to be responsible citizens of the world.
A respect for life and individuals is of
major importance in molding a worth-
while citizen. It is the parent citizen's ob-
ligation to impart to his child the attitude
that he can do something to solve the
problems of his country and his world
and that it is his responsibility to be con-
cerned and to participate.
It is the responsibility of today's citizen
to have ideals. Responsible feelings of the
American citizen are too often drowned
in the materialism of his every day life.
In his drive toward obtaining a higher
material existence, the citizen often loses
any desire to work for anyone but him-
self, forgetting that in contributing as a
citizen of the world he works for his own
interests by creating a better world for
his family and himself. Immersed in his
strivings toward personal and materiai
satisfaction, he can spare neither the time
nor the energy for responsible citizenship,
and ideals of freedom, peace and a bet-
ter world are choked off and replaced by
"I-don't-care" attitudes, cynicism, and
negative responses. A balance must be
maintained between idealism and ma-
terialism so that the citizen will be con-
tinuously aware of the world around him
and of his obligations to it, for the re-
sponsible citizen must have a sense of
values that will promote the selfless con-
tribution on his part toward the ideal of
a better world.
Finally, perhaps the most important in-
gredient of the responsible citizen today
is enthusiasm, enthusiasm for his world
and his country, and enthusiasm for im-
proving them as an individual and as one
of a group, for he must live his life in
this world and hopefully leave a better
one for his children.

Arleigh J. Dagenais, the writer

Beta Pi pledge essay competition,
expects to receive his BES in Aero
this February. Arleigh has played
sandlot baseball and has worked
summers on rocket projects for Su-
perior Engineering Co. He is a
veteran of four years' service in
the USAF, where he was an air
traffic controller.

HYDROFOIL
CRAFT ON
ITS TOES
Hamilton Standard's Electronics Department is currently
developing the automatic stabilization system for Grumman
Aircraft's exciting hydrofoil boat. This all-aluminum, 80-ton
test design is expected to reach speeds of 60 to 80 knots by
means of reducing its drag through the automatically con-
trolled "lift" of hydrofoils. For peak efficiency, the incidence
of these foils must be continuously controlled so that the
center of gravity will remain steady as wave height and
direction of flow change . . . through every kind of sea.
As you can see, the engineering requirements implicit in
designing an automatic control system for such a craft
created a variety of problems. Engineers had to consider
automatic pitch stability augmentation during take-off, cruise
and landing; manually adjustable trim control devices to
allow the pilot to set desired trim in pitch attitude; pitch
trim control from level to eight degrees bow-up and within
± .25 degrees of reference. In addition, the control, which
will require 115 ± 10V RMS at 400 ± 20 CPS, had to be
designed so that open or short circuit failure of any one
component would not put large reference voltages in circuit
areas resulting in large control surface displacements.
Making use of its experience acquired in engineering the
Automatic Stabilization Equipment for helicopters such as
Sikorsky's S-61 the Electronics Department developed the
lightweight, highly transistorized gear shown below incor-
porating the latest state-of-the-art packaging and circuitry
techniques. The block diagram on the left below shows the

AND
RESEARCH
Edited by CHARLES MASSER
This month Michigan-Education and
Research has made several stops at just
a few of the interesting yet sometimes
unheard of areas in scientific research and
development. We will travel from such
places as the Michigan Medical Center,
where a discussion on how the immunity
to disease is affected by radiation is
overheard, to the psychology labs where
an experiment is now in progress on the
visual preception of humans, in which
color amid brightness without detailed
shapes are used. So without further de-
lay we are off to the Michigan Medical
Center.
Immunity Affects of Radiation
New evidence on the way radiation
affects immunity to disease was reported
by Reuben L. Kahn (Sc.D.) of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Medical Center. In
a talk prepared for the Panamerican Con-
gress on Pharmacy and Biochemistry
meeting in Santiago, Chile, Kahn said
when an antitoxin was injected into an
irradiated area of an animal, it produced
better protection. He gave rabbits lethal
doses of diphtheria toxin, along with a
protective anti-toxin. In those animals
in which the injection site had first been
exposed to X-radiation, the antitoxin
worked "more effectively than the anti-
toxin injected in the non-irradiated areas
of the control animals.
He also reported that other rabbits
were given skin injections with staphy-
lococcus germs. This produced a "severe"
reaction in the normal animals, but only
a "mild" inflammation when the injec-
tions were made in an irradiated area.
Kahn, the developer of the world-wide
blood test which bears his name, conclud-
ed that radiation disrupts the "localizing"
effect of normal inflammation. He told
the Congress ordinary inflammation,
caused by a wound or the invasion of
bacteria or protein substances, helps pre-
vent infections from spreading to other
parts of the body. It seals off the attack-
ing organisms in the infected area and
"is one of the most powerful phenomena
that keeps us alive." In some manner not
determined, radiation upsets this local-
izing ability. The U-M scientist called it
an "anti-localizing phenomenon" and
said it is "obviously of great importance
in immunity and deserves careful study."

search grants from the National Institute

Development of the bubble chamber for the study of subatomic particles brought the I960 Nobel Prize for physics to
Prof. Donald A. Glaser. Glaser developed the bubble chamber in 1952 at the University of Michigan.
Hopkins University . In all, 28 institu-
tions within the state of Michigan shared
a total of 6.7 million for 356 research
projects.
"Bubble Chamber" Wins
Nobel Prize in Physics
Discovery of the "bubble chamber"—
man's window to the interior of atoms—
stems from a scientist's eye for a bottle
of beer and a university's willingness to
gamble on his ideas. The scientist is Don-
ald A. Glaser, 34, who won the
Nobel Prize in physics November 3 for
development in 1952 of the "bubble
chamber" at The University of Michigan.
Glaser's idea came from observation of
the foaming action of an uncapped bottle
of beer. He theorized the beer foamed
after being struck by a particle of matter
from the atmosphere, with an assist from
the heat in the vicinity of the bottle.
Glaser thought the same principle might
work in studying collisions between sub-
atomic particles hurled by atom smashers.
If these particles passed through a suit-
able liquid, he reasoned, they might
leave a trail of bubbles, enabling physi-
cists to photograph and study the results.
He approached several agencies for sup-
port in testing this theory, but was re-
jected. Then the U-M's Phoenix Project,
a privately supported atomic research
program, gambled Si500 on the idea. It
worked. Today, an estimated $35 million
a year is spent on "bubble chamber" re-
search and development.
After proving the feasibility of his
idea with Phoenix help, Glaser built an
improved chamber with liquid propane
and tested it at Brookhaven National
Laboratory, where in the first 10 minutes
of operation he obtained photographs of
nuclear events seldom seen in their en-
tirety by older methods.
Eight of his first 22 pictures, for ex-
ample, pictured the creation in nuclear
collisions of particles called pi mesons,
their slowdown and decay into mu me-
sons, and the transition of mu mesons
into electrons, one of the basic building
blocks of atoms.

1401 computer system.
HE'S MAPPING NEW WAYS TO BEAT
TRAFFIC JAMS IN LOGICAL SYSTEMS
A computer system must be versatile. The IBM 1401 sys-
tem, for instance, might go to work in a radiation lab, a
stockbrokerage office, an air operations center, a refinery,
or any one of a hundred other places. Demands upon the
individual units of the system will vary widely.
Paul Farbanish analyzes the loads placed on the system by
different applications. One of his assignments is to design
new and alternate ways for data to move from unit to unit
with the greatest speed and reliability.
Like many an engineer at IBM, his responsibility ranges
over a wide technical field. To do his job he has become
familiar with many challenging areas of electronics. Within
the 1401 system alone he dealt with circuits, data flow
control, input-output, storage, etc.
If a young engineer wants to move rapidly into the most
advanced areas of electronics, he would do well to consider
IBM. In the fast-expanding world of data systems and its
many peripheral fields, a man is given all the responsibility
he is able to handle. New ideas and new ways of doing
things are not only welcome but actively encouraged.

which would have an 80 foot wave length
in air. But the small objects which bats
would encounter during flight could not
produce appreciable reflections of such
sounds.
In 1938, Donald R. Griffin, a Har-
vard University zoologist, and G. W.
Pierce, a Harvard physicist, listened to
bats by the use of a sonic detector appara-
tus constructed by Pierce. The maximum
response of this apparatus was at 50 kilo-
cycles, which is more than double the
highest frequency audible to human
ears. This obviously reversed Maxim's
earlier proposal.
To prove that these ultrasonic sounds
were necessary for normal flight, Griffin
tied the jaws of several bats shut and
sealed their lips with collodion. In flight
they blundered helplessly into wires and
the walls of the room. If the slightest
crack or pinhole appeared in their collo-
dion masks, enough high frequency
sound was allowed to escape so that the
bats flew normally again.
Careful studies convinced scientists
that neither the high frequency ultrasonic
pulses nor the clicking sound audible to
human ears ever occurred without the
simultaneous presence of the other.
Whenever the sonic detector indicated
that a bat was emitting an ultrasonic
pulse, the human ear could also hear a
faint clicking. With the short ultrasonic
pulses bats actively probe their environ-
ment. But the emission of the sounds is
not semi-automatic, regular, or mechani-
cal. Rather, the pulse repetition rate
varies according to the needs of the bat.
There are considerable differences in the
pulses emitted by the Eptesicus bat when
cruising and when in hot pursuit of an
insect. The cruising type of pulse is also
quite distinct from anything which the
bats ever emit when in the laboratory.
The cruising (natural) pulse is of long-
er duration—10 to 15 milliseconds, while
it is only 2 to 4 milliseconds in the lab-
oratory. The longer duration cruising
pulses of the Eptesicus may start with
frequencies as high as 70 kilocycles or
as low as 33- These frequencies may have
a rapid or gradual drop during the first
few milliseconds, or they may remain con-
stant for nearly the entire duration of the
pulse. A low pulse repetition rate when

Table I. Comparison of the physical dimensions and performance of
natural and instrumental systems for echolocation, typical radar and
sonar systems of World War II have been selected for comparison
with the insectivorous bat Eptesicus fuscus on the basis of available,
published information concerning the former. (Permission from Donald
R. Griffin).
cruising several feet above the ground is
used to avoid confusion between echoes
of the bat's own successive pulses. When
the bat approaches an insect during feed-
ing hours, the pulse repetition rate in-
creases, because the bat is paying closer
attention to echoes from the insect.
Not all bats eat insects, however. Two
distinct groups, the insectivorous and the
fruit eaters or carnivorous bats, are set
up with respect to the intensity of their
emitted sounds. The first group, the in-
sectivorous or "loud" bats, orient them-
selves by means of intense pulses, easily
detectable on almost any microphone that
covers the frequency range of 10 to 100
kilocylces. Sound pressures measured
close to the mouth of this group of bats
commonly range from 20 to 100 dynes
per cm.2 or higher. The "whispering"
group of bats, because they do not feed
on the wing, emit sounds which are very
difficult to detect. Their sound pressure
levels are rarely higher than 3 to 5 dynes
per cm2.
The control of the directional pattern
of the sound pulses has been found to be
quite accurate. A bat can emit pulses
which shift from a beam pointed straight
ahead to a directional pattern which his
much more energy at 60° to one side
within a fraction of a second. As Griffin
says in his book Listening in the Dark.
"Each individual pulse has not one but
a whole family of directional intensity
patterns, and if these were measured not
merely at 90° but at many other angles
both vertically and horizontally about the
direction in which the bat is flying, we
would find that each frequency had its
own characteristic pattern and that the
high frequencies at the start of the pulse
are concentrated much more strongly in-
to the forward direction."
Before studying the facilities for sound
reception, it is necessary to find out the
source of the bat's sounds. One of Grif-
fin's co-workers observed that when a
bat's mouth is wide open, the opening
into the throat and larynx was seldom
visible. There was only a brief flicker
at the back of the tongue at the same time
that a pulse was indicated by the sonic
detector. The larynx of the bat is re-
markably large and specialized consider-
ing the small size of the animal. Two
pairs of very thin membranes, each only
about 1 /3000 of an inch thick lie on the
34

shallow cavity. Tension applied to the
membranes causes them to vibrate at ult-
rasonic frequencies sufficient to generate
pulses of sound for successful echoloca-
tion.
In the reception of echoes a directional
localization must also be possible, be-
cause in addition to simply detecting the
obstacles, the bat must know where the
obstacle is located. Frequency modulation
of the emitted pulses makes possible this
directional orientation. For example, a
change in frequency at the rate of about
20 kilocyles per millisecond will occur in
an echo reaching the Myotis bat. There-
fore, if the echo reaches one ear 0.1 mil-
liseconds before the other, the ears will
receive a frequency difference of about
2000 cycles per second. It is even pos-
sible that smaller differences than this
are detectable.
The center of the sound reception is
located in the cochlea inside the ear. The
part of the cochlea nearest the middle
ear which is concerned with the high
frequencies is unusually large in bats.
Whenever hair cells on the cochlea are
stimulated by sounds, they generate small
voltages called cochlear microphonics,
which reflect the degree to which the hair
cells of the cochlea are stimulated. The
cochlear microphonics or potentials are
electrophysiological indications for the
frequency range of the bat's hearing.
During the emission of sound, the
bat's sensitive ears require protection
from its own outgoing pulses. We can as-
sume that the emission of each pulse of
high frequency sound would place a se-
vere strain on the bat's cochlea. The ana-
tomy of the protective device is known
and consists of two muscles of the mid-
dle ear which are attached to minute
bones connecting the eardrum to the
membranous windows leading to the
cochlea. The way in which these muscles
give the needed protection is not com-
pletely understood, but a quite simple
theory is available. It is that the muscles
contract just as each pulse is emitted;
since contraction of these muscles, which
are enormously large relative to the size
of the bat, raises the sound pressure
necessary to generate a given cochlear
microphonic, it reduces the sensitivity of
the bat's hearing also.
In attempting to relate the study of a
bat's obstacle detection to an easier life
for a blind person, scientists first tried
to learn how certain blind people could
move about successfully. The first ideas
were that variations in temperature and
pressure close to the blind person's face
gave him a "facial vision." We can ima-
gine that, if we blindfolded ourselves
and walked through an obstacle course,
we would move according to what
seemed to be variations in pressure or
air currents. Actually an auditory means
of obstacle detection is more important
than the misnamed "facial vision."
Several instruments for echolocation by
blind people have been devised. The
sound sources seem to work best when
they are concentrated into a quite narrow
angle, and when the beam can be moved
about to scan the surroundings. There
is little use of these devices, however,
because it is not yet known what type of
sound would serve best for direct human
echolocation. A few laboratories and in-
cludes passive detection, which is simply
listening for sounds originating from the
submarine or other object to be detected.
In this case, if two "ears" or receivers are
used and are sufficiently separated, a
triangulation with the sound source is
possible, and its distance as well as bear-
ing can be obtained. Binaural auditory lo-
calization, as this process is called, is very
accurate. Sonar in its truer sense is an
active acoustic orientation. Here a sort of
sound signal must be emitted, and its re-
turning echoes must be detected. Its prac-
tical possibilities are limited by the abili-
ty of the listener or the receiver to dis-
tinguish between its own echoes and
foreign sounds.
It is tempting to claim that man de-
veloped radar and sonar as a result of

inent nose leaves. Bats depend on ultrasonic waves for their meals.
stitutions have several echolocation in-
struments, but the type of information
which they supply hardly makes the use
of them worthwhile. The natural sounds
which most skilled blind men base their
echolocation on come from footsteps and
finger snapping.
In the development of sonar on the
other hand, definite success is attained in
echolocation by artificial devices. Radar
also has achieved this success, although
radar consists of the emission of elect-
romagnetic waves rather than sound
waves as in bats and sonar. The success
of sonar is in the use of underwater
sound to locate submarines lying beneath
a ship. If the distance to the bottom of
the ocean is being measured, we call it
echo sounding.
A general definition of sonar often in-
his study of bats. The principle might
even be extended to include airplanes:
birds taught men the principles of flight.
But this is all wrong. As Professor Griffin
has put it, "the engineers anticipated the
biologists." Radar, sonar, and the air-
plane prompted the zoologists to com-
pare the animals to the machines, with the
result that the zoologists greatly increased
their knowledge of animal behavior. The
gyroscope is another example. Fifty mil-
lion years ago insects navigated through
primeval swamps and forests by means
of a rudimentary gyroscope connected by
the nervous system to their wings. It was
not until 1907 that a gyroscope was in-
stalled in a ship by Sperry. Perhaps there
isn't, after all, anything new under the
sun.

Of course, there are revolutionary ways

switching to an entirely different typc

"Can he run! Look." Thereupon he

Glaser describes the "bubble chamber"
in The Physical Review in January, 1955.
Little more than a year later (May,
1956), he reported development of a
"bubble chamber" using liquified xenon
gas which made possible easy and rapid
observation of both charged and neutral
particles, some of which live less than
10 millionths of a second. The "xenon
chamber" will detect neutrons, gamma
rays, neutral mesons, and almost all other
atomic particles.
Michigan physicists believe the "bub-
ble chamber" may rank in importance
with the invention of the atom smasher.

representatives.
"Three-fourths of the ducks hatched
in continental U. S. are dependent upon
breeding grounds in western Minnesota
and the eastern Dakotas," he points out.
"These wetlands, particularly glaciated
potholes, that the waterfowl need, are
located largely on private lands.

Dean Emeritus Samuel T. Dana of the

to drain water areas and the breeding
lands disappear as a result. Public au-
thorities have assumed that the bulk of
the waterfowl population will have to
come from private lands. But we cannot
expect the farmer to provide adequate
waterfowl facilities at his own expense—
it is up to the federal and state agencies
to provide most of the necessary land
through ownership, through lease from
private owners, or by subsidy to keep the
land in water.
"The government now subsidizes
drainage projects," Dean Dana points
out, so why not reverse the procedure

During the past ten years a quiet revolution has been taking place in design offices,
contracting firms, state highway departments, and fabricating plants throughout the land
whereby the use of the digital computer has increasingly aided the civil engineer in every
branch of the broad range of his activities. In the Civil Engineering Department, the Uni-
versity of Michigan is leading the way to further advances. Computer programming is first
taught in the surveying courses where the groundwork is laid for later work at both the
undergraduate and graduate level.
The IBM 704 computer, which can perform 40,000 arithmetic operations a second, is used
by students for home problems and in research. Undergraduate students solve computer
problems in hydraulics, structural analysis, structural design, and surveying. In graduate
instruction, typical problems being studied include the determination of stresses in a deep
plate beam, inelastic column buckling analyses, torsion of structural sections, the study
of the response of a tall building to earthquake shock, flood routing, hydraulic surge, trian-
gulation adjustment, and astronomic azimuth determination.

Such experience is called a Genzfeld.
meaning "total field of view."
Pickett has been working with several
other U-M researchers in developing a
more elaborate apparatus for creating the
Ganzfeld experience. "We have built a
large plaster hemisphere which, when
stood on its edge on a table, allows a
viewer sitting at the table to put his head
far enough into the hemisphere so that
he sees nothing but its white powdery
interior. "When light is introduced over
the viewer's head a Ganzfeld is exper-
ienced. With this device we have been
able to measure the brightness sensitivity
of the eye during the times when the
viewer feels blinded. "We have made
the surprising discovery that during these
blind spells the eye is just as sensitive to
changes in brightness as it normally is."
One interpretation of these findings
is that seeing can occur only where there
are things to be seen, says Pickett. "Vis-
ual perception is the perception of things,
shapes, lines, shadows—not qualities like
brightness and color."
U-M researchers have recently com-
pleted the construction of a still more
elaborate apparatus which will produce
the Genzfeld experience and allow shapes
to be gradually introduced into this total
foggy field, Pickett points out.
"This apparatus will make it possible
to investigate shape perception under
very simple visual conditions. Studies
elsewhere have shown that during the
recurring blind spells experienced in this
Ganzfeld, shapes emerging out ot this
foggy field are much more difficult to
perceive than when one is seeing nor-
mally."
Visual perception has long been of in-
terest to psychologists, but a better un-
derstanding of it is needed for design-
ing various types of instruments such as
radar scopes, instrument panels, and other
man-machine systems.

The poor beast innocently winding her
way to the out-house is about to suffer
the same searing fate that has befallen

in microwave technology, this modern
farmer has installed a magnetron unit
nearby. The extremely short radio waves
emitted by the magnetron will so agitate
the molecules of the meat, that the heat
generated by friction will cook the
chicken in fifteen minutes. If he doesn't

~fke £ditot5 Pen —
In looking back upon three and one-half years of my education
in the engineering college, I find reason to wonder whether I have
learned as much as I ought to have. I find that I am dissatisfied.
Probably this dissatisfaction is felt by the majority of my classmates.
as well. We seniors, faced with the imminent necessity of applying
our learning to the task of earning our bread and butter, tend to be
a bit uncertain of the capacity of our educational background to
bring forth fruit.
I imagine that it would be a waste of editorial space to exhort
underclassmen to study hard and learn well, for such advice is
given them from all sides in great abundance. But perchance some-
thing in the manner of "an inside tip" on how to keep on top of
one's studies might be considered seriously by a reader here and
there. Therefore, I would like to pass along to the younger student
this maxim, which I believe to be the most important rule for the
conquest of any course: study every subject at least as frequently as
the class meets.
This theory of regular studying works because it permits the
student to understand what is going on at each meeting of the class.
If one has prepared his lessons for a particular class in advance, he
will be able to give 100% attention, whereas the fellow who puts
in just as much time, but all on the weekend, sits through many
classes in which he has something less than a perfect idea of what
the instructor is discussing. His attention level and his degree of
absorption tend to lag. If he has not been getting enough sleep
(who does?), he will become drowsy and inattentive. The lectures
on material not perfectly understood seem dull and a bit confusing.
Before long, he will become completely lost. His classmate who
has some idea of what is going on through daily preparation will
get the most out of the lecture, and will learn while in class. The
man prepared in advance will therefore learn more and better with
less study, merely because he is regular.
Catching up from behind is one of the most time-wasting, dis-
couraging, and altogether inefficient things that a student may
ever be required to do. And if the "catching up" should be in the
form of cramming for an exam, inferior results are almost assured.
Despite the fact that the regular studier winds up doing less
work for the same amount of learning, very few students have the
self-discipline to follow such a pattern rigorously in all courses.
Therefore, I believe that some means to make daily preparation of
lessons almost imperative for the student should be considered. I
would suggest that the "incentive" for students to come to diss
prepared come from a policy by the individual instructors to call
upon students at random to recite. Probably there would be no
need to grade the students on their class recitation; the desire to
avoid embarrassment alone would suffice.
This method has been used with considerable success in foreign
universities, at the military academies, and in the Michigan Law
School. At these schools, students know they may be expected to
feed back part of the information which they supposedly had learned
for that day's class. Erratic workers are brought to light, and proper-
ly made to realize that effective learning requires systematization
of effort.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Another advantage of oral recitation is the instructional value
to other students—a fellow student may be able to present an
answer or to discuss a problem in a different manner than the in-
structor, making it more understandable. Additionally, the instructor
is enlightened because he has a direct measure of points that the
students do not understand very well.
Different courses have different needs, and the preferences of
instructors are very valid considerations. Therefore, I do not pro-
pose this as a blanket policy. However, I sincerely believe that
such a system, used to the practical limit, would result in easier
and better education in the engineering college.

SJnk Spoti
A couple of years ago a new idea came to the Michigan engi-
neering campus. Transfer students coming here from other large
engineering schools were surprised to discover that our college did
not sponsor an open house to introduce non-engineers, including
community, family, friends, Lit people, and high school students
to the mysteries lying within our buildings.
Thus was Engineers' Weekend born. The engineering college
now had an annual open house. It was student-organized and
student-run. Last year's open house, held in May, was termed by
its chairmen "a moderate success." At that time, everyone connected
with the open house had great expectations that Engineers' Weekend,
1961, would be bigger and better than ever before, as a result of
the experience gained and the growing interest in showing off the
facilities of the college.
Something seems to have gone wrong. The Engineering Coun-
cil, whose responsibility it is to set up the committee to run the
Weekend, has been unable to find a chairman. Signs requesting
petitions for the job have been up for weeks. The technical societies
have been asked to poll their members. No response.
We feel that this is a worthwhile project, particularly to the
extent that we are able to show something of engineering to pros-
pective Michigan engineering students. May we request that any
interested student drop an inquiring note in the campus mail
addressed to Engineering Council, 3212 East Engineering Building?
Incidentally, many jobs other than the general chairmanship need
filling also.
While we are on the subject of the Engineering Council, we
might point out that Council meetings are open to all students, and
that this is the perfect place to air gripes, grudges, suggestions,
comments, etc., about any facet of the College. The members are
eager to leap upon any new idea to improve conditions, so if you
have any, drop in at 3529 SAB at 7:15 on alternate Thursdays--
beginning with February 16, and then March 2, 16, and 30.

A CHALLENGE
FOR ENGINEERS

Stephen S. Attwood, Dean, College of Engineering
and Professor of Electrical Engineering.
The February issue of the Michigan
Tecbnic, edited and published by-
students in our College of Engineering,
is widely distributed to high schools
throughout the state. I want to take this
opportunity to "speak" to our high
school students who may be interested
in pursuing the exciting careers that
are possible in the fields of science and
engineering.
Science and engineering go side by
side in searching out and applying in-
creased knowledge of the fundamental
physical laws of the universe. As new
laws are discovered and utilized, we can
expect to find a steady, and even acceler-
ating, improvement in man's physical
life and well-being. This should be an
exciting challenge to many of our young
people.
There is, however, a considerable diff-
erence between the objectives of scien-
tists and engineers. The difference is not
a sharp one since any one man may work
in both areas. In general, the scientist
endeavors to extend our understanding
of the laws of nature or to discover new
laws, without being particularly con-
cerned about how they may be applied
to the development of equipment or
processes.
The engineer's objective is to take
these laws and put them to work in
developing new designs, new processes,
new equipment, new products, new ma-
terials. But this is not all. Let's look at
a definition of engineering.
"Engineering is the profession that
applies the laws of science to the
efficient and economic conversion of
natural resources for the benefit of
man."
In this definition, note these words
"economic" and "benefit of man." In
the latter it is clear that the engineer has
to work with people, and for people, to
their benefit. This introduces problems
of human relationships that are not al-
ways easy to handle. The "economic"
phrase indicates that the engineer must
always be concerned with the cost of his
objective. Sooner or later, he may be
called upon to make decisions involving
large sums of money. This calls for char-
acter and responsibility.
In the years ahead, we foresee tre-
mendous developments that may go far
beyond many of the things we now have
—such as computers, transistors, TV,
missiles, satellites. Do some of these ideas
challenge you? If so, there is a place of
responsibility and honor for you in the
profession of engineering.
A career in engineering, full of re-
sponsibility and challenge, is not the
easiest path to follow. It calls for a basic
interest in mathematics, physical sci-
ences, and English. To be effective, ideas
must be communicated in both oral and
written form.
Let's conclude by quoting an anony-
mous poet.
We have two ends
With a common link;
With one we sit,
With one we think.
Success depends
On which we use:
Heads we win,
Tails we lose.

FRESH WATER
FROM THE SEA
As the rapidly rising demand for fresh water in
the world approaches the naturally available
supply, it becomes increasingly important that
man learn to desalt sea water cheaply and
abundantly in the near future.
by JOHN STARK
This 15,000 gallons per day
■freezing process pilot plant de-
veloped by the Carrier Corp. of
Syracuse, N. Y., is now under test
at Wrightsville Beach, North Car-
olina.
During the twentieth century a serious
shortage has been developing in
many parts of the world of one of man-
kind's basic resources and most vital
needs—water. Certainly, man's peren-
nial quest for fresh water has had a pro-
found impact on the course of the human
race since the time of Moses, yet there
was always the feeling that abundant sup-
plies of water could be found if one just
looked far enough. Although our water
needs in the immediate future can be sat-
isfied by more effective utilization of our
presently available fresh water, consider-
ation of a few basic facts clearly indi-
cates that we must also increase the
fresh water supply itself.
• At present, the fundamental source
of all our fresh water for agricultural, in-
dustrial, and domestic use is rainfall.
• Of the total amount of rain falling
on the United States, about 515 billion
gallons per day are available to us for
use. This rather constant figure repre-
sents the upper limit of available fresh
water.
• The consumption of water in the
United States is increasing so rapidly that
the current rate of 290 billion gallons
per day is expected to more than double
in just twenty years, reaching an esti-
mated total of 597 billion gallons per
day in 1980.
Constant Supply, Rising Demand
It should be apparent that if sometime
before 1980 the demand for fresh water
has become equal to the supply, our
economy will suffer severely unless in
the meantime methods have been devel-
oped for greatly increasing the supply of
fresh water in this country at reasonable
cost.
Even now the demand for water has
outstripped the supply in many parts of
the United States. Southern California
currently transports its water 240 miles
from the Colorado River across moun-
tains and deserts through a complex pip-
ing system to the Pacific coast. But this
huge project will soon be inadequate. In
the November election the people of Cali-
fornia voted on the most expensive prop-
osition ever put on a ballot—a 1.75 bil-
lion dollar bond issue to utilize the water
of the Feather River 400 miles to the
north. However, shortage of water is not

a problem of California alone. A U.S.
Geological Survey study showed that in
1957 over 1000 commmunities in this
country, representing one seventh of our
entire population, experienced water
shortages of varying degrees. Nor is water
supply a problem of this country alone.
Many parts of North Africa, the Mid
East, the Caribbean and other areas al-
ready experience a severe lack of water.
Desalting the Sea
There is no doubt then that substantial
new sources of fresh water must be found
in the near future for many regions of
the world; and the most likely sources
are the salt waters of the earth—the great
oceans and the inland reserves of brack-
ish water. Of course, utilization of these
saline (salt) waters is not a new idea.
Man has dreamed of making fresh water
from the sea for centuries. And in fact
there have been commercial sea water
conversion plants operating for a num-
ber of years in scattered plates on the
globe; including one on the Island of
Aruba in the Caribbean which is pro-
ducing 2,700,000 gallons of fresh water
per day. However, even the most effi-
cient of these present plants (that at
Aruba) produces water at a cost of about
S2 per 1000 gallons, which is approxi-
mately ten times the price we in the
United States currently pay for fresh
water. Since our economy consumes water
at a tremendous daily rate—e.g. the pro-
duction of I ton of steel requires 275
tons of water—it stems imperative that
processes be developed soon which con-
vert salt water to fresh water at a cost
comparable to that of obtaining water
from conventional sources.
Congress Acts
Recognizing the potential seriousness
of the fresh water supply problem in the
United States, Congress in 1952 passed
a Saline Water Conversion Act which
authorized the Department of the Inte-
rior to establish an Office of Saline Water
(OSW) with an initial budget of $500,-
000 to carry out research and develop-
ment activities in the conversion of
saline water. This budget was later ex-
panded to $10,000,000 as more than
forty conversion processes came under
intensive study by the OSW in their ef-
fort to determine which processes would
be most suitable for commercial opera-
tion.
In the fall of 1958 a Joint Resolution
of Congress was enacted authorizing the
construction of "demonstration plants
for the production, from saline or brack-
ish waters, of water suitable for agricul-
tural, industrial, municipal, and other
beneficial consumptive uses;" and an ad-
ditional sum of $10,000,000 was appro-
priated for the construction of five of
these demonstration plants. According to
the OSW a "demonstration plant" means
a "plant of sufficient size and capacity to
establish on a day-to-day operating basis
the optimum attainable reliability, engi-
neering, operating, and economic poten-
tial of the particular sea water conversion
process or the brackish water treatment
process selected by the Secretary of the
Interior for utilization in such plants."
The particular conversion processes
chosen for the five demonstration plants
were those processes which on the basis
of laboratory and pilot plant investiga-
tions appeared to have the greatest prom-
ise for the economic conversion of saline
water on a large scale. In Table 1 is
given a brief description and the pres-
ent status of these five OSW demonstra-
tion plants. The conversion process em-
ployed in each of these plants will be
described in some detail subsequently
in this article.
Before going further, a few of the
terms commonly used in describing water
should be clarified.
Average sea water contains about
35,000 parts per million (ppm) of
dissolved solids.
Average brackish waters contain
3000-5000 ppm of salts.
The standard for fresh or potable
water is 500 ppm (as a maximum) of
dissolved salts.
From the above figures it can be readi-
ly seen that the solution to the world's
fresh water problem lies simply in re-
moving economically from each 1000
pounds of sea water at least 34^ of the
35 pounds of salts.
Economics of Conversion Processes
In discussing the overall problem of
producing fresh water from saline waters,
it must be kept in mind that the basic
factor is the cost of conversion. For there
are numerous chemical and physical pro-
cesses which are capable of removing the
salt from saline water; but it is vitally
important that processes be developed
and utilized in the near future that will
accomplish this conversion to fresh water
in large quantities at reasonable cost.
Since economics is the fundamental
consideration in saline water conversion,
attention should be given to the three
principle types of cost encountered. These

and fuel, and operation and maintenance.
Among the individual cost items found
under these general headings are pur-
chase of land, erection of the plant,
standard engineering equipment (such as
vessels, pumps, pipelines, and furnaces),
special equipment, standby facilities, in-
strumentation, raw water treatment and
storage, service facilities and buildings,
fuel, power, steam, any chemicals used
in treatment of the water, maintenance-
materials, operating and maintenance la-
bor, overhead, interest and depreciation,
taxes, and insurance.
It should be apparent that if various
conversion processes are going to be eval-
uted meaningfully on an economic
basis, all of the pertinent costs involved
must be kept in mind. Nevertheless, in
recent years optimistic cost estimates have
sporadically appeared in the press which,
upon closer study, have shown a neglect
of significant items of cost.
In order to attain uniformity in cost
estimating, the Office of Saline Water
in 1955 in cooperation with its consul-
tants developed a standardized cost esti-
mating procedure so that the economics
of all existing and proposed conversion
processes could be realistically compared.
In Table 1 are included predicted costs
as of July, I960 for the five OSW demon-
stration plants.
The large number of processes which
have been proposed for producing fresh
water from saline waters may be classed
in six general groups: 1) distillation by
various kinds of evaporators; 2) solar
distillation; 3) membrane processes; 4)
freezing of water; 5) solvent extraction;
and 6) other thermal, chemical, and elec-
trical processes.
Of these six types of processes, the
greatest amount of research and develop-
ment activity has been directed to var-
ious thermal and mechanical distillation
methods. Basically, distillation is quite
simple. The saline water in a container
is boiled and the vapor is collected and
condensed, leaving the salt behind. How-
ever, large quantities of heat energy—
about 9550 BTU's per gallon of water—
are required for this simple distillation,
and engineers have through the years
developed several evaporation processes
which use much less fuel.
Vapor Compression Distillation
One such process is "vapor compres-
sion distillation." The simple still men-
tioned above evaporates salt water to
steam at atmospheric pressure. If, how-

ever, instead of condensing this steam, it
is compressed to a pressure somewhat
greater than atmospheric, its temperature
will rise and its sensible heat can be
used to evaporate more salt water; and
the additional heat energy provided is
considerably greater than the mechanical
energy used to drive the compressor.
Many small conversion units of this type-
were used by the armed services during
World War II on islands where fresh
water was not readily available natur-
ally.
The OSW demonstration plant at Ros-
well, New Mexico will operate on a
forced-circulation vapor compression cy-
cle. (Forced circulation of the salt water
feed is used in order to increase the rate
of heat transfer in the evaporator.) Fig. 1
shows a schematic diagram of this type
of distillation plant. When salt water is
boiled in a tubular heat exchanger, the
water which vaporizes is heated further
by mechanical compression. This super-
heater vapor then condenses in the evap-
orator-condenser and in doing so again
boils an approximately equal amount of
salt water to salt-free vapor. This cycle
is repeated continually, with the distillate
being discharged through another heat
exchanger so that it preheats the saline-
feed—which in New Mexico is brackish
water.
Multiple-Stage Evaporation
Another distillation process which
makes more efficient use of heat energy
than a simple still is multiple-stage long-
tube vertical evaporation. In a long-tube
vertical (LTV) evaporator, the saline-
water feed is passed through tall vertical
tubes where it is made to boil by the
condensing of steam or water vapor on
the shell (outer) side of the tubes. As
the feed boils, the salt-free vapor is
removed and condensed.

INCENTIVES
Many labor and management conflicts could
be eliminated by company investigations of the
principles of incentive management.

by BRYAN WHIPPLE,
Editor-in-Chief
The Lincoln Electric Company of
Cleveland, Ohio may well be the
most unusual manufacturing concern in
the nation.
While Lincoln is a rather small com-
pany beside the giants it competes with
in its field (arc welding machinery and
supplies), it has achieved a most remark-
able record:
Lincoln has not had a work-stoppage
of any kind due to labor-management
disputes since 1933. The competition has
aggregated hundreds.
There is no labor union as such in the
Lincoln plant, only a sort of association
of employees.
The labor turn-over rate at the Lincoln
Company is about one-third that of man-
ufacturing companies in general.
Lincoln now sells most of its products
for about 80% of the sales price of 1933,
despite materials costs that average 220%
of the 1933 rate.
The compensation of the average Lin-
coln employee is about double that of the
average employee in competing electri-
cal-industry plants.
The sales value of products per em-
ployee, even at the low prices asked, is
double the electrical machine industry
average.
The average annual per cent change in
productivity per production worker at
Lincoln, between 1934 and 1950, was
plus 15.35%, while for the machinery
industry as a whole, including electrical,
the change was only plus 2.74%.
In 1956, the average Lincoln em-
ployee's compensation, including bo-
nuses and annuities, was $11,209.
How It's Done
How can the Lincoln Electric Com-
pany achieve such fantastic results in its
manufacturing operations? The secret lies
in the fundamental philosophy of the
management. The people who run Lin-
coln, right from president James F. Lin-
coln down to foremen and inspectors, are
applying a system called incentive man-
agement. This philosophy is concerned
with every facet of management to some
degree, but it is in the field of human
relations that the system is most effective,
and through which most of the remark-
able results have been achieved. The log-
ic is somewhat as follows:
1) Most production workers would
like to earn more money, and will be
willing to assume new responsibilities
and to work better {not harder) in order
to do so. In addition, these workers can
and will develop skills and abilities that
they never knew they were capable ol
until they were given the encouragement
of a financial incentive.
2) These same workers once did, or
perhaps still do, enjoy participation in
rough sports and athletic contests. Into
these games and contests they poured all
of their ability, energy, and skill—and
it was fun. Why cannot similar circum-
stances, a similar atmosphere, be made
to surround industrial work? If men arc
oriented toward their work as amateur
athletes are toward their sports, and there
is no fundamental reason why they ought
not to be, industrial production will be
greately benefited and the worker will
find his employment more enjoyable.
3) Recognition of superior employee
effort is a third way in which smooth,
efficient operation of the Lincoln plant is
gained. Recognition is implied in 1) and
2) above, but should also be given to de-
serving employees for its own sake, in
the form of promotions tied only to mer-
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


on good workmanship, and so forth. A
friendly and cooperative manner between
all levels of workers is thus gained; this
is essential in achieving continually out-
standing performance.
System Really Works
This nutshell treatment of the very
successful incentive philosophy at Lin-
coln Electric is hardly sufficient to con-
vince most persons who have no first
hand acquaintance with incentives that
such simple rules, when honestly and
continually applied, can have such sur-
prising results. These tenets stem to be
little more than the usual industrial ver-
sion of how to "win friends and influ-
ence people." One might be inclined to
think that such policies would bring
about increases in productvity on the
order of \0r/r to 15%.
However, these tenets are not mere
policies, they are a philosophy. Their
total application, in every phase of Lin-
coln activity, results in productivity two
to four times that of the competition. For
example, since the company firmly be-
lieves that workers ought to be rewarded
for their efficiency, the company has an
elaborate scheme by which the employees
are able to buy and own most of the
stock. This encourages the employees to
think as if they were the managers, for,
as stockholders, they are on the "man-
agement side" as well as on the "labor
side." Since dividends go to those who
are responsible for their size, their size
tends to be assured. This internal owner-
ship also helps the employees to realize
that the company exists for their benefit,
and that it is good sense to help it
prosper.
Explained In Book
The entire system of "Incentive Man-
agement" is explained in detail in a very
interesting book by that title written by
company president James F. Lincoln. The
book has been privately published by the
Lincoln Electric Company. The price of
the 284-page hard-cover volume has been
set in accordance with the principles
described therein—SI. I believe it may
also be found in the engineering library.
Those wishing to purchase a copy may
the system is so successful, it has not
been used elsewhere—for instance, by
Lincoln's competition—there is an an-
swer. The Lincoln plan requires a great
deal of nonconformist thinking to estab-
lish it in a plant; the managers and own-
ers alike must adopt a viewpoint on
certain matters of corporate organization
and policy that are heretical. Mere emu-

The foregoing has been an unpaid
commercial, but not for the book—I am
sure that even Lincoln cannot be mak-
ing much at that price—rather for the
philosophy it contains. Even those engi-
neers who may never be called upon to
supervise workers in a factory should
note the amazing achievement of this
company and recall it occasionally as
proof that men are capable of much
more than they are apt to believe. Only
adequate incentive is necessary to effect
such miracles.
Stumbling Block
For those who might wonder why, if
1942 1943 1944 F943 1946 047 194a 1949
lation of some of the ideas at Lincoln is
insufficient. Incentive managers must take
the system to their hearts, and let no
shred of traditional thought once deter
them. In addition, they must be unusually
capable managers in all the ordinary as-
pects. Management-ownership attitudes,
prejudices, inclinations, and abilities are
the determinants of incentive-philosophy
success.
If the basic tenets of this philosophy
were read and appreciated for their
worth by one-tenth of all future manag-
ers, our national industrial wealth and
living standard might b? doubled.

Science and. the JUaur:
LIE DETECTORS
The physiological and psychological make-up
of a human being makes one of law enforce-
ment's chief tools a possibility.
by DAVID PAH
The scene is a bare rectangular room
lit by a single unshaded bulb. It is
occupied by two men. One, a murder
suspect, is sitting in a chair and has nu-
merous instruments strapped to his arms,
legs, and torso; the other, a police offi-
cer, is standing in front of an impressive
looking machine with two colored lights
—one marked "truth" and the other
"lie"—as the prominent feature of its
control panel. The officer asks, "Did you
shoot S - - - - K - - - - on the night of
December 6, I960?" The suspect replies,
"No!" Immediately one of the colored
lights begins flashing to indicate truth or
lie as the case may be.
The above—though it may be over-
dramatized—is the conception many peo-
ple have of a lie detector in operation.
Unfortunately, there is no machine in
existence which can detect a lie as easily
and as accurately as this hypothetical de-
vice. However, a machine—the poly-
graph—does exist which records certain
physiological phenomena; these records
can then be used as a reliable criterion
for spotting deception. Before we discuss
the operation of polygraphs, however,
we should know the nature of the above
mentioned physiological phenomena.
Physiological Principles
A multitude of experiments have es-
tablished that emotions have a definite
and immediate effect on certain bodily
functions. These effects are due to the
action of one area of the brain, the hy-
pothalmus, which acts as a control center
for the integration of body functions
with emotional pressures. When stimu-
lated by an emotional change, the hypo-
thalmus causes a corresponding change
in circulation, respiration, digestion, me-
tabolism, glandular activity, and body
electrical resistance.
It has also been established that emo-
tions can't be turned on and off at will.
An accomplished actor may be able to
conceal all outward signs of emotion such
as facial expression and tone of voice, but
he can do nothing to control the physio-
logical effects of his emotions.
In most cases telling a lie is accom-
panied by a powerful emotion: fear ot
detection. Yet, in laboratory exrx-riments
using volunteers who had nothing to fear
from detection, polygraphs consistently
indicated emotional changes accompanim:
lies. A possible explanation is that the
subject enters into the "spirit of the
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and is especially anxious to see if the ma-
chine will be able to detect his lies. It
seems, then, that telling a lie is almost
invariably accompanied by an emotional
change of some sort.
Mechanical Functioning
The polygraph does not actually tell
whether or not a person is lying; it does
detect and indicate emotional changes by
recording changes in certain bodily func-
tions: specifically, the skin's electrical
resistance, blood pressure, heart beat, and
breathing rate. The machine itself consists
of three main parts—the pneumograph,
the galvanograph, and the cordio-sphyg-
mograph—and operates in an unexpect-
edly simple manner.
The instrument which records the
breathing pattern is the pneumograph. It
consists of an accordian-shaped tube
which is strapped to the subject's chest.
Breathing causes the tube to expand and
contract thus changing the interior air
pressure. This change in air pressure is
transmitted through a rubber tube to the
breathing rate bellows pictured in figure
(1); this, in turn, causes the bellows,
which operates a recording pen through
a mechanical linkage, to expand and
contract. Thus the movements of the pen
correspond to the subject's breathing and
the resulting pattern is recorded as a
wave form on a moving sheet of graph
paper. Any change in the subject's breath-
ing pattern (indicating an emotional
change) will be evident as a change in
the wave form.
The cardio-sphygmograph, which op-
erates in a manner similar to the pneu-
mograph, records blood pressure and
heartbeat. It consists of a standard blood
pressure cuff like those found in any
doctor's office. The cuff is wound around
the subject's upper arm and inflated with
air. Each heartbeat causes blood to flow
through and expand the arteries in the
arm; the strength of the expansion will
depend on the blood pressure. These ex-
pansions and contractions cause a corre-
sponding action in the blood pressure
cuff which results in a change of the in-
terior air pressure. The pressure change
operates the bellows pictured in figure
(2) which moves another recording pen.
Thus, any change in heartbeat or blood
pressure will, like a change in breathing
rate, be evident as a change in wave
form.
There is an important reason for the
difference in the shapes of the two bel-
lows. The pneumograph bellows oper-

ates at close to normal air pressures. How-
ever, since the blood pressure cuff is in-
flated to higher pressures, it would strain
a bellows of this type beyond its limits.
The bellows in figure (2) allows a great-
er expansion and thus eliminates the
possibilities of its being ruptured.
The galvanograph circuitry consists of
a wheatstone bridge. One of the resis-
tances is formed by the subject's palm,
which is connected to the circuit by two
electrodes. A change in the skin's resis-
tance, which is thought to be caused by
a change in the body's neural currents,
will cause a current to flow through a
galvanometer movement thus operating
a recording pen. As a result, any change
in skin resistance is indicated as a change
in a third wave form. The three wave
forms mentioned are recorded simulta-
neously on a single sheet of moving
graph paper.
Operating Procedure
The basic operating procedure of the
polygraph is as relatively simple as its
mechanical construction. First, the various

WITH
TECHNOLOGY
New electronic ranges that cook by high fre-
quency microwaves may soon replace the con-
ventional kitchen range.

These are just a few of the amazing
cooking feats now being performed by
a new electronic range that cooks by
high frequency microwaves rather than
conventional electric heat.
Electronic Range Opens Up New
Cooking Era

because it cooks 90% of foods ordinar-
ily cooked on surface units, this new de-
velopment opens up an entirely new

cooking era. Cooking is done in minutes
instead of hours, and foods can be
cooked on serving dishes of fine china,
paper plates, glass and other non-rru.--
tallic utensils.
Microwaves Have Unique Properties
The electronic range cooks by high
frequency microwaves which have unique
properties. Materials in the microwaves'
path do one of three things: reflect, such
as all metal surfaces; transmit, such as
paper, cardboard, and glass; or absorb,
such as foods.
Magnetron Generates Microwaves
A magnetron, a two-element vacuum
tube in which the flow of electrons is
under the influence of an external mag-
netic field, is used to generate extremely
short radio waves called microwaves.
These microwaves travel forward from
the magnetron through a wave guide and
are reflected downward into the range
cavity, where a stirrer, or four-blade fan,
distributes the waves uniformly through-
out the range interior to prevent im-
properly distributed energy from causing
"hot spots" in the food. The magnetron
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


cycles per second and has a useful energy
output of about one kilowatt-hour. The
electronic range operates on a 220-volt
electric current, just as a conventional
electric range.
Once the microwaves have reached the
range interior, they cook the food by pen-
etrating it up to a depth of two and one-
half inches, causing agitation of mole-
cules and friction to produce heat for
cooking.
Chromium Range Liner Cooks Food
Evenly
In this new electronic range-, a chro-
mium lining is used instead of the enam-
eled raw steel liner used in a convention-
al oven. The chrome provides a shield
through which the microwave energy can-
not penetrate, for although all metals will
absorb some energy, non-magnetic ma-
terials such as chromium absorb far less
energy than magnetic materials like enam-
eled steel. As a practical example, a com-
bination microwave infra-red range was
recently developed by the Westinghouse
Electric Corporation. The Westinghouse
engineers found that the energy losses
due to absorption in this combination
oven with a chrome-plated oven liner
were about 150 watt-hours lower than
the losses of the raw steel oven liner. As
a result, food cooks from all sides at
once because microwaves striking the
chromium lining of the range are con-
tinually reflected and literally bombard
the food.

Baking by telephone is now a reality. As demonstrated here by Miss Joyce Leicht,
engineers of Westinghouse Electric Corp. turn on and off by telephone
any electrical appliance.
Baking by Telephone Now a Reality
In conjunction with this development,
Westinghouse engineers have also devel-
oped a new method of operating ovens
and other electric household appliances.

phone" is now a reality. With equipment

phone, dial her home number, and, by
means of a special relay system, the oven
may be turned on or off, depending on
previous settings. Distance is no barrier
and the system can be applied to virtually
any electric appliance.
Electronic Range Has Special Browning
Element
Because foods cooked in less than 18
minutes will not brown, the electronic
range has a specially-designed, high-
speed browning element for browning
that may be operated simultaneously with
the microwave cooking. This browning
clement is useful when cooking broiler
steaks and other foods requiring brown-
ing or crust.
New Range Operates Easily
All functions of the electronic range-
are controlled by four knobs above the
door. One knob turns on the main power,
while another activates the magnetron
for microwave cooking and automatically
times the cooking operation. A "Hi-Lo"
selector permits an alternate speed for
cooking such items as roasts. The fourth
knob controls the browning element and
is calibrated up to five minutes.
In addition, a built-in safety feature
stops electronic cooking immediately
when the door is opened. Cooking can be
watched through a perforated metal pan-
el in the door which also serves as a vent

Servicing the microwave components
is relatively easy. Almost all of these parts
may be repaired or replaced from the
front of the range after the lower front
panel is removed.
New Comfort and Safety Features
Introduced
The advantages offered by the new
electronic range are many and varied.
Probably its most impressive advantage
is the remarkable cooking speeds made
possible. For example, a two-layer cake
bakes in six minutes compared to about
30 minutes in a conventional oven; one
from the range to the table, since uten-
sils only become hot as heat from food
is transmitted to them. Hot pads are re-
quired only when the special browning
element is used.
Temperature is eliminated as a cook-
ing factor and all cooking is determined
by time. The microwave cooking control
contains an automatic timer calibrated in
seconds and minutes; when cooking
time is completed, a signal bsll rings un-
til manually stopped.
Another advantage is that stale bread
and rolls can be refreshed as if they had
just been taken from a baker's oven.
Left-overs and complete meals can also

potato bakes in four minutes and eight
potatoes bake in eight minutes compared
to about 45 minutes in both cases in a
conventional oven; a frozen turkey cooks
in 5 minutes per pound compared to
about 25 minutes per pound in a con-
ventional oven.
Advantages other than speed are
gained from microwave cooking. Elec-
tronic cooking is cool because the micro-
waves create heat only in the food and
not in the utensils and range interior.
Thus, food can be cooked in serving
dishes and taken by hand immediately
be reheated without loss of flavor or
moisture, and foods have greater nutri-
tional value because fast, microwave cook-
ing results in a greater retention of min-
erals and vitamins than does slow, con-
ventional electric cooking.
Also, food odors are greatly reduced in
electronic cooking because food is cooked
too fast for odors to circulate.
Microwave cooking cuts down on dish-
washing because food is cooked so fast
it does not have time to adhere to the
sides of dishes and utensils. Similarly,
cleaning the range is comparatively sim-
ple because spattered or spilled foods arc
not baked to the cool oven sides and
may be wiped off with a damp cloth.
Microwave Cooking a Reality in the
Near Future
Even now, such corporations as West-
inghouse, American Motors, and General
Electric have developed either a single
microwave cooking unit or a combination
microwave infra-red range that is highly
effective. Incidentally, many home econo-
mists have reacted more enthusiastically
to the latter arrangement. Since even the
strongest advocates of microwave cooking
admit that conventional cooking does
some things better and they do not fore-
see an end to conventional ovens or sur-
face units, it was felt by many economists
that a combination range should be de-
signed first. In this way, homemakers
will be able to "fall back" on the con-
ventional oven while they are learning to
fit microwave cooking into their pro-
grams. Therefore, a combination range-
would be a step forward in that a double
oven installation would not be required.
Two Main Factors Stunt Growth of
Microwave Cooking
Although the microwave range has
"wrinkles" that must be "ironed out,"
just as any other new development, most
home economists feel that there are only
two main factors stunting the growth ot
microwave cooking. The main one and
the only one of importance right now is
the prohibitive cost of these ranges oc-
casioned by the present high cost of
microwave components. (A typical single
microwave cooking unit currently costs
about $1200, including delivery and in-
stallation.) However, it is generally felt
that the next few years will see the price
drop sufficiently for microwave cooking
to reach a mass market.
As the price comes down the second
retarding factor will assume importance,
that being the natural reluctance of home-
makers to change their cooking habits
overnight. A considerable educational
program in the form of advertising and
personal demonstrations will be needed
to combat this factor.
Once these two problems have been
overcome, the electronic range will un-
doubtedly begin to reach a mass market.
The next few years should see this time-
and effort-saving "oven of the future"
adopted by the American homemaker as
standard kitchen equipment.

What's it take to make the right connection?
Plenty! Consider the problem. Western Electric manufac-
tures the switching systems which connect some 60-inillion
Bell telephones throughout the U. S. The average call over
today's electromechanical system requires 420 relay opera-
tions. All together, this interconnecting equipment makes
up the heart of what is, in effect, the world's largest machine.
That's where Western Electric and you come in. The
switching equipment for this "machine" involves an enor-
mous manufacturing job carried on by our plants throughout
the country. Because of the size and service requirements
involved, we require quality standards far exceeding those
of ordinary manufacturing. The size of this job presents an
unusual challenge to the engineer who may save the Bell
System many thousands of dollars by even a small cost-
reduction step.
While today's switching calls for a priority on engineer-
ing, tomorrow's will be even more exciting. For even now
the revolutionary Electronic Central Office is under field
trial and promises to remake the world of telephony. Future
Western Electric engineers, working closely with their
counterparts at Bell Telephone Laboratories, will concen-
trate heavily on developing manufacturing methods for this
ECO equipment.
Your Western Electric assignments may cover many of
our other responsibilities as the world's leading communica-
tions manufacturer. Perhaps you'll work on advances in
microwave transmission, or even on satellite communications.
Joining Western Electric may well be your right

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&amp;WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt &amp; Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you do?—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can flourish.
For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,
Engineering Department, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft,
East Hartford 8, Connecticut.

At P&amp;WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab-
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused
on the development of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this live mock-up
of a reactor, nuclear scientists and engineers can
determine critical mass, material reactivity coefficients,
control effectiveness and other reactor parameters.

Representative of electronic aids functioning for P&amp;WA
engineers is this on-site data recording center which

Just before the Christmas holidays, a
serious air crash over New York City
proved to be the worst disaster in air-
plane history. This month Michigan Ed-
ucation and Research presents the views
of a Michigan faculty member on how
this disaster and crashes similar to it can
be avoided. Also covered are clips re-
garding Cancer research at Michigan, in-
ternational work of the Phoenix Project,
aging of the Great Lakes, and the inter-
esting facts surrounding the launching
of the Russian Satelite Sputnik I and
the increase of Russian studies at the
University.
Safety in Air Traffic
A University of Michigan expert called
for a "crash program" to improve the
nation's air traffic control system, accom-
panied by a long-range research program
in flight safety.
Prof. Paul M. Fitts (Ph.D) of the
U-M Department of Psychology said
"much better" voice communication is
needed between pilots and ground con-
trol centers and this can be developed
with existing equipment.
More importantly radar beacons —
called transponders—could be installed
in major commercial aircraft, permitting
clearer visibility and positive identifica-
tion of planes on ground-based radar,
regardless of weather conditions.
Transponders already are used in mili-
tary aircraft.
"With these kinds of equipment im-
provements, humans can do a much bet-
ter job of air traffic control until com-
puters may be developed to help handle
this task," he commented.
"In addition to a short-range program
involving use of on-the-shelf hardware,

Prof. Paul M. Fitts, Department of
Psychology
we need long-range research to determine
the optimum balance between human and
mechanized control of air traffic.
"Finding out how to build an ideal
air traffic control system will take many
years of research. In the meantime, we
should apply what we already know as
best we can."
One of the nation's leading researchers
on man-machine systems, Fitts formerly
directed the Aviation Psychology Labora-
tory at Ohio State University, studying air
traffic control programs. He was one
of the founders of the Flight Safety
Foundation.
Sputnik and Russian
Russian used to be just another for-
eign language before Sputniks — but
science students now take Russian se-
riously, says Associate Prof. Horace W.
Dewey of The University of Michigan
Department of Slavic Languages and Lit-
eratures.
"More students in science fields are
studying Russian than ever before," he
says. The U-M has offered two special
reading courses in Russian for the past 10
years for the purpose of providing a read-
ing knowledge of Russian for research in
science, mathematics, social sciences, and
humanities. But it was not until the Sput-

gan taking the courses, Dewey reports.
Only upperclass and graduate students
can take the courses, and a grade of B or
better satisfies the doctoral language re-
quirement.
Science students in these courses are
in a hurry to acquire at least the read-
ing knowledge of Russian, Dewey points
out, since some of the important scien-
tific papers in Russian are not available
immediately in translation.
"Although students in these courses
can read important material, they would
have a hard time in communicating in
spoken, Russians still have a lot to learn
in certain fields of engineering or in
fields like orthopedic surgery."
Phoenix Project Helps Thailand
Thailand is well on the way to acquir-
ing its first nuclear reactor for peaceful
research on atomic energy. Construction
of the reactor by an American firm is
expected to begin soon.
The University of Michigan through
its Phoenix Project is helping the Thais
with their project. This year William
Kerr flew to Bangkok to advise the Thai
government on training scientific person-
In 1957, Professor Kerr first visited
Thailand to discuss the training of per-
sons to administer and set up the re-
search and reactor program. Since then,
the Thai government has sent four per-
sons to the U-M for reactor training and
instruction in nuclear engineering. Two
have completed their training and have
returned to Thailand. Two are now study-
ing in the U-M's graduate program in
nuclear engineering.
The Thai reactor, to be located near
Bangkok, will be operated by Chulalong-
korn University under the auspices of the
Thai atomic energy commission.

Students from many countries, including Thailand, work at the Phoenix Project under the direction of

Russian. But the courses give them a
basis from which they can further their
study in Russian. The main thing they
seem to want is a reading knowledge,
and since they come from highly special-
ized scientific fields they have a limited
time to devote to language studies."
Of course, not all Russian scientific
writing is of high caliber, Dewey cau-
tions. "In mathematics, physics, and chem-
istry, however, the Russians have made
significant progresses, and, "according to
American specialists with whom I have
nel and on planning a reactor program
for use in connection with their one
megawatt, swimming-pool type research
reactor, which will be similar to the
U-M's Ford Nuclear Reactor. Discussion
will also include laboratory design.
Thailand is one of about twenty na-
tions the U-M has assisted with atoms-
for-peace programs. Since 1956 the Uni-
versity's Phoenix Project has carried out
such assistance to underdeveloped na-
tions through a contract with the Inter-
national Cooperation Administration.
Cancer Program
A report just released by The Univer-
sity of Michigan Cancer Research Insti-
tute shows that U-M scientists are con-
ducting 128 separate research projects
on the problems of cancer.
Prepared for doctors and for cancer
organizations at the national, state and
county level, the report summarizes cur-
rent efforts by the U-M in attacking can-
cer through research, teaching and care of
the disease's victims.

Manned space missions of extended flight
duration must have a large, continuous, long last-
ing and reliable source of electrical power. Only
a nuclear reactor heat source is compatible with
these requirements to provide power for propul-
sion and to operate all equipment aboard the
spacecraft. Advanced nuclear energy conversion
systems are now being developed by Garrett's
AiResearch divisions to meet these new power
requirements.
Besides nuclear and solar power systems for
space applications, other project areas at Garrett
include: electronic systems, such as flight data com-
puters and solid state transistorized conversion
systems for high speed generators; and complete
environmental systems for advanced flight vehicles.
This diversification of project areas enables
the engineer at Garrett to specialize or diversify
according to his interest, not only making work
more interesting but increasing the opportunities
for responsibility and advancement.
An orientation program lasting a number of
months is available for the newly graduated engi-
neer, working on assignments with highly experi-
enced engineers in laboratory, preliminary design
and development projects. In this way his most
profitable areas of interest can be found.

A multi-stage LTV evaporator consists
of a number of individual evaporators, or
stages, in each of which saline water
flows through the vertical tubes. In the
first stage externally supplied steam is
used on the shell side to effect evapora-
tion. The vapor from this first stage
then enters the shell side of the second
drop from stage to stage in order that
evaporation takes place. Large stills of
this type of twenty or more stages have
been proposed as the cheapest way of
making fresh water from the ocean on
a major scale.
The OSW demonstration plant at
Freeport, Texas is a long-tube vertical

stage where it condenses and is collected
as distilled water; but in condensing it re-
leases latent heat sufficient to evaporate
water in the tubes of the second stage.
The vapor from the tubes of this second
stage then evaporates more water when
it condenses in the third stage and so on.
Because of heat losses the temperature of
the water vapor leaving each stage is
lower than that of the previous one and
there must be a corresponding pressure
evaporator system of 12 stages, as can
be seen in the model, Fig. 2. Construc-
tion of this plant, which was designed by
W. L. Badger and Associates of Ann Ar-
bor, was begun in August by the Chi-
cago Bridge and Iron Company. When
completed, 1,000,000 gallons per day of
fresh water will be produced in the
plant's twelve stages, with the first stage-
operating at a temperature of 250° F and
the final stage at 110° F.
Scaling and Corrosion—Two Major
Problems
Although distillation currently seems
to be the best way of producing fresh
water, two serious problems are encoun-
tered in the actual operation of evapora-
tors. These difficulties are the corrosion
and scaling of the distillation equipment,
particularly the heating surfaces. Sea
water is a highly corrosive solution, and
hence the development and use of corro-
sion-resistant materials of construction
is important. Extensive tests were made
of different materials by the International
Nickel Company and W. L. Badger and
Associates during the operation of the
OSW pilot plant long-tube vertical evap-
orator at Wrightsville Beach, North Caro-
lina.
Badger concluded that steel can be
used as a material for the construction of
the evaporators, pumps, and piping but
probably not for the heating surfaces.
Of the more expensive materials, alumi-
num is unsatisfactory due to severe pit-
ting in sea water, while aluminum brass.
90-10 copper-nickel alloy, and admiralty
metal resist quite well the attack of sea
water. What may be the most economical
heat transfer surface is a thin layer of a
corrosion-resistant metal backed up by
cheaper steel. Other possibilities for
evaporator construction which have not
been sufficiently explored are the plastics,
glasses, and ceramics.
Intensive study has also been carried
out at Wrightsville Beach of the scaling
of heating surfaces during distillation.
Scale is defined by Badger as a deposit
formed by precipitation from solution
of a substance which has a solubility that
decreases with an increase in tempera-
ture. Since in an evaporator the highest
temperature is at the heated surface and
hence the solubility of the scale-forming
material is lowest there, deposition will
most likely occur on that surface. The
University of Michigan Research Insti-
tute is currently conducting an investiga-
tion headed by Professor K. F. Gordon
of the Chemical Engineering Department
with the objective of obtaining a better
knowledge of the mechanism and limits
of scale formation on a heated surface
in order to provide a sound basis for de-
veloping methods of scale prevention.

For, none of the methods currently used
to combat the formation of scale is
wholly effective.
Multistage Flash Distillation
There is a rather new distillation meth-
od — multistage flash distillation — in
which scaling is not as serious a problem.
Flash distillation is based on the equilib-
rium principle that if heated water is in-
troduced into a container having an am-
bient pressure less than the vapor pres-
sure of water at that temperature, some
of the water will vaporize. In a multi-
stage flash distillation unit, saline water
is preheated under pressure and then
fed into a vessel where the pressure is
lower than the equilibrium pressure of
the feed. Because of the reduced pressure,
part of the feed water flashes into vapor,
thereby lowering the liquid temperature.
The flashed vapor then condenses in a
condenser (through which the saline
feed is passing—so as to make use
of the heat of condensation). The liquid
which remains then passes to the next
vessel where the pressure is still lower,
(Continued from page 54)
and the flashing process is repeated. A
flash distillation unit of 42 stages will be
built at San Diego, California by the
Fluor Corporation as one of the OSW
demonstration plants (Fig. 3). Original
plans to have a nuclear reactor supply
the energy for this plant have recently
been suspended.
Harnessing Solar Energy
Considerably different than the distil-
lation processes described thus far is the
attempt by engineers to harness the en-
ergy of the sun for the distillation of
saline waters. Interest in solar stills cen-
ters around the fact that one of the ma-
jor costs of saline water conversion—fuel
or energy—is eliminated if the sun's en-
ergy can be effectively utilized. The sim-
plest form of solar still consists of a
shallow pan containing salt water and
covered with a sloping glass plate which
is transparent to the radiation of the
sun. As water is evaporated from the pan
by the sun's rays, the vapor condenses on
the underside of the glass cover and
trickles down the glass to a trough in
which the drops are collected. In order
to produce fresh water on a large scale,
solar stills covering many acres would
be needed. A substantial saving in equip-
ment costs would result, however, from
the use of inexpensive, transparent and
durable plastics rather than glass.
Currently, the greatest amount of ac-
tivity in the development of solar stills
is found in the Mediterranean countries.
Among the organizations conducting
studies are the National Commission of
Special Energies in Spain, the National
Physical Laboratory of Israel, the Univer-
sity of Bologna in Italy, the Academy of
Sciences of the U.S.S.R., and govern-
ment groups in the countries of North
Africa.
Using Membranes and Electric Current
Now let us consider methods other
than distillation that may be employed
for the removal of salt from saline wa-
ters. One of the most interesting methods
of conversion is the membrane process
known as electrodialysis. Electrodialysis

FRESH WATER FROM THE SEA
(Continued from page 38)
utilizes an electric current, two electrodes,
and thin membranes which permit the
passage of either only positive ions (ca-
tion exchange membranes) or only nega-
tive ions (anion exchange membranes).
This process can be understood by
studying the operation of the electrodialy-
sis cell of Fig. 4. Between the two elec-
trodes are alternately placed anion and
cation exchange membranes. (The anion
exchange membranes are labeled A( —)
and the cation exchange membranes C
( + ).) Saline water is allowed to enter
the cell so that, before a current is ap-
plied, in each compartment there is wa-
ter containing an assortment of positive
(mostly sodium) and negative (mostly
chloride) ions. By referring to the fig-
ure, the migration of ions which takes
place when current is applied can be fol-
lowed. The general observation should
first be made that the positive ions, be-
ing attracted to the negative electrode,
will tend to travel to the left unless im-
peded and the negative ions, being at-
tracted to the positive electrode, to the
right.
In compartment Wt the positive ions
will be attracted to the left electrode and
will stay in W,; the negative ions would
like to move to the right out of W, but
cannot because membrane Cu will not
pass anions. Hence the concentration of
salt will build up in compartment W,.
Looking at compartment P, on the other
hand, it is seen that the positive ions can
move out of P, to the left through C,,
and the negative ions can move out to
the right through A,.,. Compartment P,
then will contain nearly pure water. As
a result, the cell will be composed of
compartments alternately high and low
in salt concentration which can be drained
to obtain reject brine and fresh water
respectively.
Unlike most other conversion processes,
the power requirements for electrodialy-
sis depend directly on the concentration
of salts in the feed. For this reason, this
process is most suitable to brackish water
feed—as will be used in the OSW dem-
onstration plant at Webster, South Da-
kota.
Making Fresh Water by Refrigeration
Another means of extracting fresh
water from saline waters which at pres-
ent compares favorably cost-wise with
processes discussed thus far is by refrig-
eration or freezing. In principle, freez-
ing is the opposite of distillation. Where-
as in distillation heat is applied to water
and salt-free vapor taken off overhead,
in freezing processes heat is removed
from water and relatively salt-free ice
produced.
From the standpoint of energy require-
ments, conversion by freezing has an in-
herent advantage over distillation—to
freeze one pound of water 144 BTU's
must be removed from it while to evap-
orate the same pound 972 BTU's of ener-
gy must be supplied. Another advantage

Figure 4.—Brackish water can be de-
salted by the application of an electric
current to an electrodialysis cell in
which anion and cation exchange resins
are alternately arranged.
of freezing is that the scale-formation
problems encountered in distillation pro-
cesses are not nearly as significant at low
operating temperatures. However, freez-
ing methods do involve a difficult sepa-
ration step—washing the product ice
free of unwanted brine.
In a freeze-process plant, saline feed is
first cooled by heat exchange with prod-
uct fresh water and rejected brine. Then
the liquid feed is partially frozen, pro-
ducing some vapor (which is removed
overhead) and a slurry of ice in brine.
Now the slurry is sent to a washing col-
umn where the brine is drained off and
the ice washed. Finally the washed ice is
melted and fresh water obtaind.
The fifth OSW demonstration plant,
to be built on the East Coast, will employ
one of three freezing processes which arc
now in the pilot plant stage. These pro-
cesses differ mainly in the manner in
which the actual freezing step is carried
out.

line water conversion processes that are

Harley A. Cloud (BSEE, Penn State '58) is a group leader
in the development of simulation testing equipment for a
new solid state airborne computer which IBM is building
for the Air Force.
TRIPS THROUGH THE STRATOSPHERE
WITHOUT LEAVING THE GROUND
A computer will be the heart of the navigation and control
systems for future aircraft designed to operate in the
stratosphere.
Such a computer is now being built by IBM for an advanced
aircraft under development for the Air Force. Harley Cloud,
an IBM engineer, is developing simulation equipment which
will put the computer through its paces. His equipment
will simulate the systems functions encountered by the
250-ton aircraft at Mach 3, fourteen miles up, with poten-
tial adversaries in wait.
Without the airplane leaving the ground, his testing equip-
ment will simulate such inputs to the computer as accelera-
tion in the inertia) system, velocity in the doppler radar, and
air pressure in the air data subsystem. These simulation
techniques will help protect lead time for the entire project.
Responsibilities Are Large. As a group leader, he is direct
mg the design, laboratory breadboarding, electrical draft-
ing, testing and evaluation of this ingenious equipment.
It's a very responsible job for a man out of school less
than three years.
But age is no barrier to advancement in IBM. In the fast
moving world of data systems, it is ideas and the ability
to do the job that count. And fresh new ideas and abilities
are always welcomed at IBM—whether in development, re-
search, manufacturing, or programming.

The 128 research studies cover subjects
ranging from fundamental physical and
chemical principles to the highly complex
effects of modern clinical treatment.
Many of the investigations seek new
knowledge of normal growth. According
to the report, "Progress toward the solu-
tion of the cancer problem has been slow
because too little is known about normal
cells."
Other studies attempt to find variations
among different kinds of cancer, the ef-
fects of hormanes and anticancer com-
pounds, and the clinical value of radia-
tion.

World famous University Hospital,
center of the current program
of cancer research.
In the field of virus research, the report
states "It still has not been definitely-
established that cancer in man is the re-
sult of any known virus, although some
evidence is beginning to accumulate . . .
A culture of (cancerous) mouse cells
has been found to contain a virus. This
virus will produce tumors in mice (and),
in tissue culture, this virus will trans-
form normal human cells into growing
cancer-like cells."
Teaching programs on cancer, says the
report, include regular courses in the
Medical School curriculum, special lec-
tures, demonstrations, conferences and su-
pervised investigations. "Particular atten-
tion is directed to arranging special lec-
tures by visiting clinicians and investiga-
tors who present first-hand their recent
observations ..."
The report also describes the broad
range of cancer diagnosis and treatment
being conducted at the U-M Medical Cen-
ter. This includes use of drugs by the
Cancer Chemotherapy Unit, expanding
use of radioisotopes, and efforts to com-
bat leukemia.
Sources of funds for U-M cancer re-
search, states the report, include the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, American
Cancer Society, the U-M Memorial Phoe-
nix Project, and a number of private do-
nors and foundations.
Youthful Fountain?
The Great Lakes contain the world's
largest supply of fresh water—6,700,-
000,000,000,000 gallons of it. But a
University of Michigan oceanographer
has warned that unless steps are taken to
preserve these Lakes, "our children's
children may be catching rain water or
distilling sea water to allay their thirst."
Now U-M Great Lakes scientists be-
lieve they may be close to a method which
could lead to means of preserving the
Lakes as a fresh water resource. The
problem isn't that the 66 million people
in states touching the Great Lakes will
drink them dry. Even if they were to use
the water at 50 gallons per person per
day, without replenishment, it would be-
some 5,500 years before they reached
final mud. The problem is, rather, what
man dumps into the lakes—sewage and
industrial wastes. These chemical and or-
ganic materials "age" the Great Lakes
faster than they would age naturally.
To somehow control this aging process,
thus preserving and furthering the Great
Lakes use as a natural resource, is the
long term goal of the Great Lakes Re-
search Division (GLRD) of the U-M's
Institute of Science and Technology. Di-
vision scientists now are approaching a
first step toward this goal, according to
GLRD Director David C. Chandler
(Ph.D.), in devising a method to meas-
ure the rate at which organic material is
produced in the Lakes.
If they can find a way to determine
this quickly and over a wide area, they
could then perhaps begin to understand
this process, following which they could
seek ways of controlling it—and thus of
managing the aging of the Lakes. They
would like to be able to measure the
rate of photosynthesis that occurs in a
given column of water—or how much
organic material is fixed in the water in
a day. (Photosynthesis is the method in
nature, still not wholly understood, by
which sunlight as energy is converted to
vegetable organic matter.) Their method,
which would be a measure of the energy-
nutrient chain, is a refinement of some-
what similar methods reported by other
scientists and was developed largely by
Dr. George W. Saunders, Jr. (Ph.D.).
It would work like this: Sunlight enter-
ing the water is the source of energy for
the tiniest species of acjuatic life, which
in turn produce organic matter that serves
as food (a source of energy) for larger
organisms, in a long and complicated
chain. The amount of organic matter pro-
duced depends on the intensity of sun-
light which decreases with increasing
depth.

This happened in Detroit. A man
walked into the Missing Persons Bu-
reau and announced the disappearance
of his wife. The policeman on duty
asked for a description.
"She's 5 feet even," the man began,
"and she weighs 240 pounds. She's cross-
eyed, my wife is, but only in one eye.
She's kind of sloppy, especially when she
doesn't wear shoes."
The policeman noted the description,
then said, "When did you first notice the
disappearance?"
The husband thought for a moment.
"About five weeks ago."
The policeman was stunned. "Five
weeks ago," he repeated. "Why did you
wait until now to report it?"
The husband grinned sheepishly. "For
the first three weeks," he confessed, "I
thought it was a dream."
Blonde: "I'd like to see the captain
of the ship."

A "stream-of-action" environment with unusual growth
possibilities should be a major factor in a choice of
career. And that's an excellent reason for considering
carefully the opportunities existing in Sikorsky Aircraft.
We believe that our company is just the "right-sized
stream". Young engineers can enjoy diversified, small-
group activities, as well as stature opportunities in a
field that is wide open to the expression of imagination
and professional competence.
Sikorsky Aircraft is the company which pioneered the
modern helicopter. Our current program is far-ranging
and is recognized as one of the broadest and most
challenging in the entire aircraft industry.
Work associations are stimulating and in an atmosphere
of progress. Assignments could include joining an elec-
tronic team of twenty to thirty associates—or—working
with a highly selective group of four or five on interest-
ing problems of radiation, instrumentation, auto pilot-
age, automatic stabilization, etc.
If you want to enter this "stream-of-action", the time is
now. Opportunities for personal progress have never
been greater.

FRESH WATER FROM THE SEA

Helps you perform
miracles in instrumentation
currently in the advanced development
or pilot plant stage have been described.
However, research and initial develop-
ment work is being carried out on a va-
riety of other conversion processes which
should at least be mentioned. Since 1953
Texas A &amp; M College has conducted lab-
oratory investigations of the feasibility
of making fresh water by solvent extrac-
tion. In this process, saline water is con-
tacted countercurrently with an organic
solvent (the secondary and tertiary
amines have given the best results) to
produce a more concentrated raffinate
and an extract containing nearly salt-free
water, which separates upon heating.
The testing program has shown that sol-
vent extraction is most applicable to
brackish waters.
A process which is now widely used
for water purification but apparently not
applicable for reasons of economics to
feed with as high an impurity content as
saline waters is ion exchange. In this pro-
cess, the impure water is passed through
exchange resins where its various salt
ions are replaced by unobjectionable ions
from the resin. But for treatment of sea
water the cost of the chemicals for re-
generating the resins makes the process
prohibitively expensive at present.
Among the other processes being stud-
ied which are at least theoretically feas-
ible are gravitational diffusion, chemical
precipitation, electrolysis, ultrasonics, and
the use of ultra-high frequency currents.
Still other means have been suggested of
obtaining fresh water from the sea. One
of the more imaginative proposals is to
tow icebergs from the Arctic regions and
let them melt in large dry docks at har-
bors in the temperate zone.
This country's water problem was sum-
marized by Dr. A. L. Miller, Director of
the Office of Saline Water in a recent
speech. "It is hard to realize," he said,
"as we stand on the threshold of space,
that within a few years our number one
domestic problem may be the provision of
adequate supplies of plain ordinary water.
The predicted increase in water use in
the coming decades makes it unmistak-
ably clear that we will need more water
than can be provided from readily avail-
able natural sources of supply. We must
turn to scientific and technological re-
search to develop a new source of supply
that can provide an ever-growing percent-
age of tomorrow's water."

Engineering Mechanics is in its fiftieth year at Michigan. The Department was created to
teach the engineering aspects of classical mehanics to all engineering students. Its versatile
graduates, particularly those with higher degrees, move readily into areas where the de-
mand is greatest. This results in activities as modern and glamorous, as demanding and
rewarding, as those enjoyed by an engineer.
Men broadly trained in Engineering Mechanics are prepared to work on fundamental
problems in many branches of engineering. The staff and the graduates of the Department
have been actively and responsibly engaged in the past on such things as the design of a
200-inch telescope, the analysis of airship structures. More recently, they have engaged in
research in rarefied-gas hydrodynamics, vibration studies of helicopters, submarines, naval
vessels, and ocean liners, and analysis of missile airframes. They have been actively as-
sociated with the development of sea-going nuclear power plants, reactor hydraulics, and
nuclear rocket propulsion. They have made many contributions in the area of fluid mechan-
ics and its application to manufacturing processes.

A young accountant had been keeping
steady company with a girl for five years.
Doggedly he refused to pop the ques-
tion. Naturally the girl was getting im-
patient.
One night the accountant took his girl
out to a Chinese restaurant. She studied
the menu and began telling her boy
friend what she would care to eat.
"How would you like your rice," the
boy friend asked, "fried or boiled?"
The girl looked at the accountant, took
a deep breath, then said very slowly and
distinctly: "Thrown."
* * *
A group of scientists were discussing
politics in the space age. Suddenly, a dog
that belonged to the owner of the house
interrupted. "Gentlemen," the pooch
said, "this is the most erudite and so-
phisticated discussion I have listened to
in some time, but the discussion is com-
pletely theoretical and wholly devoid of
any practical aspects."
One of the guests, a middle-aged lady,
bent down and ran her hand over the
dog's back. "Why, bless you!" she ex-
claimed. "You know how to talk."
"Certainly, I know how to talk," the
dog replied. "Why shouldn't I? After
all, I went to Cornell."
"All right," said the dog's owner,
looking the dog right in the eye. "Let's
go easy on the bragging. Don't forget—
you never graduated."
The little girl's father was a union or-
ganizer. "Daddy," she said to him one
evening, "I can't sleep. Will you tell me
a story?"
Daddy nodded, "Once upon a time-
and-a-half . . ." he began.
Two beautiful actresses, well-turned
and well-stacked, were admiring a dia-
mond necklace in a swank jewelry store.
"It's out of this world," said one, "But
who would be jerk enough to pay $40,-
000 for it?"
"I don't know," the other actress an-
swered. "But don't worry, I'll find him."

instruments are attached to the subject;
then, the machine is turned on and ad-
justed. The examiner then asks a few
neutral questions about a know fact such
as "Are you wearing glasses now?" or.
"Are you in Detroit now?" These ques-
tions (assuming the subject is cooperat-
ing and answers them truthfully) serve
to establish the normal response pattern
for that individual. Then, if the subject
lies during subsequent questioning, there
will be a change in the response pattern.

Sergeant Barkman's statement that poly-
graphs, when used under ideal condi-
tions, are 95% accurate.
Uses in Police Work
Because of its slight inaccuracy and
lack of standardized test procedures, poly-

consequently, the machine is used mainly
as an "investigative aid." If a test indi-

right and wrong, and people of low
I.Q.'s experience little or no emotional
change when telling a lie. Consequently,
a polygraph test would be useless in
their cases.
While doing research for this paper,
the author had an opportunity (through
the courtesy of Sergeant Barkman of The
Michigan State Police) to take a poly-
graph test. I was given a deck of cards
and told to pick one and insert it back into
the deck without divulging the number.
Sergeant Barkman then asked, "Did you
pick number 7? Did you pick number
9?—" This continued until all cards had
been mentioned. I answered, "No" to
each question, as instructed. The poly-
graph record pictured shows a change in
cates that a person is innocent, most law
enforcement agencies will release him.
This, of course, saves the trouble, ex-
pense, and embarrassment of further in-
vestigation. On the other hand, a poly-
graph indication of guilt merely serves
to encourage the law officers in their
search for legally admissible evidence.
The polygraphs most important con-
tribution to the cause of justice is not
the conviction of the guilty; it is the
freeing of the innocent.

As the editor of a technical magazine, I have many occasions
to come into contact with other such magazines, especially those
published for professional engineers and scientists of this kind or
that. Some of these magazines are regularly sent to the Tecbnu
office; others we encounter in the libaries in the course of research
on subjects for articles.
More and more I am coming to the realization that these pro-
fessional publications are of the utmost value and importance both
to the student and to the professional. I would like to take this
editorial opportunity to expound some of the values that I find in
these publications.
Perhaps the greatest value to be reaped from a regular study
of the trade magazines within one's own specialty is the chance it
gives to keep abreast of the latest developments in that field. New
discoveries and theories are generally reported in trade journals
considerably before they become generally accepted and widely
used. New discoveries and new techniques are customarily made
known by their discoverers, inventors, or proponents in exactly this
manner. In this respect one can learn about them years before cur-
rent textbooks or general practice catches up. Early knowledge of
such new innovations is especially important to the practitioner in
a field, because of the pressures of competition, both for the sales
dollar and for promotion within one's company. Often the best
way to secure a competitive advantage with a certain product is to
be the first in the field with a new twist. Also, the best way to
call the attention of one's superiors to oneself, outside of actually
making the innovation, is to propose adoption of the innovation.
While a student is still in school, he is not quite so concerned
with these very recent developments, because he is required to
learn certain fundamental material that is found in, and best treated
by, standard texts. But once he enters his chosen profession, it is
hoped that he has mastered the fundamentals and is familiar with
present methods and procedures. Then, education and development
of the individual must take on the form of continual awareness of
the things that are just coming in.
The education of the scientist continues through the reading
of technical publications in yet another way. By reading the journ-
als of cognate fields, that is, related fields of study which support
and reinforce the ability to cope with the basic field, the young man
increases the effectiveness of his work and his own pleasure in per-
forming it.
Not only the editorial matter, such as articles and news items,
is of educational benefit in these magazines. The advertising con-
tained in technical magazines contains a wealth of practical infor-
mation that is available to the young scientist nowhere else. In
order to effectively carry out any sort of scientific or technical work,
one must have information about products and services that can be
purchased, as well as theory. In designing a steel mill or a chemical
plant, the engineer must know something about chemistry or
metallurgy, true. But he must also know whether the design that
he makes can be economically assembled. He must know whether
the particular presses, piping, chemicals, and other capita]
goods can be purchased in the sizes, quantities, and at the prices
that are demanded by the design. He should also know whether the
types of equipment that were used in last year's project have been
improved upon or supplanted by better types.
Finally, the advertisers in technical magazines are always very'
eager to make additional information about their products known.
By effective utilization of the advertising literature made available
by these companies, the engineer can often find that much of the
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


he might have to do himself, has indeed been done for him by
those eager to furnish supplies.
Most technical magazines have so-called "reader-service cards"
upon which one can circle numbers corresponding to the advertisers
in a certain issue. When returned to the magazine, its publishers
will inform those advertisers whose numbers have been circled that
the person who submitted the card wants further information about
the advertised product. Usually the company then furnishes com-
plete engineering data, catalogs, the name of the nearest distributor,
etc. Such information is obviously invaluable to the busy engineer.
I feel that if I were to take a month's time after graduation,
and read every article in the trade journal of my own specialty (i.e.)
that I would learn just as much as I have in four years of college.
This does not mean that my college has been a waste of time, for
I surely would not even understand these magazines without a good
formal educational background in the field. This example merely
serves to illustrate the great store of valuable, practical, and current
information in these magazines.
There are a number of other reasons why these magazines are
of value. Many offer placement and recruitment services limited
to the particular specialty, which are very valuable to those seeking
a job in a limited field. Another value is the possibility for exchange
of ideas of concern to the field but which are not in themselves
technical, for instance, what is the opinion of men in my field on
unions vs. professionalism? How will the latest changes in Wash-
ington affect the quantity and nature of the work in my field? How
should a man of my background, experience, and ability be earn-
ing? Why am I or am I not attaining these standards of financial
and personal satisfaction? What is wrong with me or my company
that we don't get the jobs, contracts, profits, promotions, etc., that
others do? Awareness on such issues is a major benefit to be derived
from reading technical magazines—such as this one.

Presently the Technic is in need of a few interested men (or,
more especially, women) to try out for staff positions in certain
areas of magazine production in which our present staffs are a bit
thin. Although there are openings in most fields, we are especially
eager to obtain a few more writers.
In order to write articles for the Technic, it is not required to
become a full-fledged staff member. We stand willing and eager to
consider articles submitted to us as one-shot propositions, or to put
men on our reserve list of writers to be contacted for material on
special subjects. It is our policy that writers may refuse any assign-
ment that does not interest them, and usually articles are either
requested by those who write them, or the ideas may arise with the
authors themselves. So, if you are interested in technical article
writing, do drop by our office at 3077 East Engineering.
We have been requested by our national advertising representa-
tive, Littell-Murray-Barnhill, Inc., to run an informal poll among
15 third-year subscribers, to determine the effectiveness of the
advertising being run in this magazine. This reminds us that the
over 50% of this magazine which consists of advertising is impor-
tant to all, as well as the written matter. It is important to us
because it is our bread-and-butter. It is important to the advertisers,
because the new men it is intended to recruit will be the lifeblood of
those companies. Most of all, it is important to the reader, because
those many personnel recruitment messages carry within them the
spirit and character of the companies that we must someday choose
between as employers. The student will possibly save himself much
grief later on, if he will acquaint himself with the "corporate image"
of these diverse employers right now.

Perhaps the best one is the sum
total of them all:
At DuPont, there are no dead-
end streets for able, ambitious
people.
For example, DuPont is grow-
ing constantly, and growth means
more jobs. Every year we spend
$90 million in research alone, to
develop new products that create
challenging new opportunities.
In addition, DuPont invests an
average of $33,000 in each em-
ployee to provide the most modern
equipment, the finest facilities, the
best supporting services—factors
of special significance to the tech-
nical man.

of being the absolute lowest! More-
over, after five years of service, the
majority of Du Pont engineers and

UNUSUAL METALS
Many of the rare and unusual metals play var-
ied and important roles in modern metallurgy.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE
Editor-in-Chief
Scandium—an unusual metal,
sometimes classed as a rare earth
metal.

Of the ninety-plus elements that occur
in nature and make up the whole
of the known universe, more than sixty
possess properties that classify them as
metals. However, engineers rarely hear
any reference to, or make much use of,
more than a handful of the known
metals. Iron, aluminum, copper, and now
magnesium are the staple metals of the
engineering repertoire, along with the
metals used in ferroalloys, such as nickel
and chromium. Even allowing for the
newer metals of engineering importance
such as titanium, and such long-known
metals as lead, tin, silver, and gold,
only a decided minority of all known
metals are frequently studied in engi-
neering courses.
What, then, of the many other metals
which are not so prominent? Have they
any uses today? What are their properties?
How are they recovered from their ores?
These scarce metals with which this
article is concerned are not only the so-
called rare earth metals, although these
are included in the group we are dis-
cussing. We are also concerned with the
dense metals such as osmium, and with
the metals which are often used in
making special steels, but are rarely used
by themselves, such as vanadium.
First, it is not merely scientific curiosity
that is bending the interest of engineers
in the direction of the scarce metals. It is
the need for very special properties and
characteristics in materials that points
interest toward the exotoic metals. The
increasingly severe demands that space-
age technology is making upon more
common materials makes it ever more
imperative to seek out and utilize prop-
erties known or presumed to exist in
these metals.
New Extraction Methods
The first hurdle that the materials en-
gineers had to surmount before a new
material could even be tested in an ap-
plication where it was suspected to be
useful was to obtain a sufficient quantity
for testing. For many of the metals in
the "scarce" category, this was extremely
difficult and time-consuming. The ores
of these metals are usually found mixed
together in the same deposit, so that a
mere reduction or electrolysis procss
left a mixture of several metals instead
of a nearly-pure metal as with, say, iron.
Further separation was made difficult by
the chemically similar properties of many
of the metals. The problem was rather
more like separating isotopes of a single
element than like the usual ore-purifica-
tion process.
One of the time-honored methods for
separation of rare-earth metals was by
selective precipitation of certain com-
pounds from solution. If the precipita-
tion process was repeated time after time,
the metal which precipitated in com-
pound form slightly more readily than
the other would eventually be separated
in reasonably pure form.
An interesting story is told about a
professor at a certain Big Ten univer-
sity who made a life's project out of the
preparation of a sample of one of the
scarce metals in pure form by the precipi-
tation method. Every morning for twenty
years, it was the duty of this man's gradu-
ate students to come in and decant the
contents of a large row of beakers from

happy professor had a lump of "metal
X" the size of a large walnut.
The excited and pleased professor took
his lump of metal X to a convention at
a rival university. To his great dismay,
he found that a research team there had
as "rare earths." In fact, so effective is
the new method, that stocks of these
metals have grown all out of proportion
to present demand, and the producers of
these metals are sitting around with huge-
lumps of the stuff in their warehouses,
waiting for uses to be developed.

prepared a lump of the same metal, the
size of a cocoanut, in less than a fort-
night!
How had this been done? By a very
newly-developed process using banks of
ion-exchangers (for the explanation of
ion exchange, refer to "Ion Exchange,"
The Michigan Teclmic; April, I960).
This was the big breakthrough in pro-
duction of a number of the scarce metals,
especially those which have been known
Properties
One subgroup of the scarce metals has
been arbitrarily made1 by considering
those metals whose annual production
falls between the limits of 100 pounds
minimum and 100 tons maximum. There
are about fifteen metals in this group.
Germanium is perhaps one of the more
familiar of these metals because of its
now widespread use as a semiconductor
in electronics. First it was used to make
the tiny rectifying diodes that have al-
most displaced crystals of galena (PbS)
as the "crystal" in crystal sets. Germa-
nium is also the most important materia]
in the manufacture of transistors. The
quantity used is small, but the purity
must be very high, and its importance is
unquestioned. Tellurium is also a semi-
conductor, although not so important as
germanium. Both of these metals exhib-
it nonmetallic properties in some degree,
such as high electrical resistance.
Cesium metal, whose melting point is
so low that it liquifies in an overheated
room, is valuable in photocells and in
solar power research because it emits
electrons when struck by certain types of
radiation. Thorium also exhibits this
property; it is also radioactive. Cesium
is further used in vacuum tubes to re-
move residual oxygen after evacuation
by pumping, because it combines readily
with oxygen. The silvery or black spots
sometimes seen on the glass envelopes ot
tubes, which mislead many to think that
the tubes are "burned out" are only resi-
due from the spark-ignition of the ce-
sium electrode placed in the tube and
"fired" as a part of manufacture.
Indium is another little-known metal,
although there is a company of rather
good size that produces little else—the
Indium Corporation of America. This
metal has a very low melting point; this
feature makes it useful in automatic
sprinkler nozzles, and in making special
solders, such as a 50 50 tin-indium
solder which will wet glass.
Some of the scarce metals are very
dense, and exhibit good wearing prop-
erties, which makes them acceptable ma-
terials for phonograph needles. Osmium
is frequently employed in this use, and
while inferior to both sapphire and dia-
mond, is the best metal needle.
A number of the scarce metals are
also considered precious metals, and as
such are in demand for jewelry and or-
namentation. These include platinum,
osmium, and palladium. This group is
often used as a coating for electrical con-
tacts subject to frequent make-and-break
operation or to sparking, because the)- do
not pit or corrode in service.
Rhenium is a tough, corrosion-resis-
tant metal which has been found serv-
iceable in high-temperature applications
where other metals tend to volatilize and
deposit themselves where they are not
wanted. It is also used for pen points.
Cost
The average price of the above metals.
although they very widely, is about $1000

these metals are used only when abso-
lutely necessary. However, the prices of
most of them are falling steadily as pro-
duction capacity increases. The ores from
which these metals are extracted are
found in many areas of the world. Can-
ade, South America, Africa, and the
USSR are important producing areas for
many, while a few of the ores (e.g.
cesium, gallium, hafnium, etc.) are found
in the U.S. The U.S. and Canada pro-
duce about 45%, Africa 30%, and Rus-
sia 15% of the world's supply of the
platinum-class metals. Users of rare eartli
metals who want some of their proper-
ties but who do not require any particu-
lar metal in pure form may obtain the
so-called "misch metal," a widely-mar-
keted alloy containing several metals in
varying amounts, never separated from
one another.
The future for this subclass of scarce
metals is somewhat unclear. These met-
als are caught in an economic vise; high
costs prevent widespread use, and also
limited use prevents further research into
better and cheaper production methods.
Great strides have been made recently
with the new ion-exchange equipment,
however. When usage once again over-
takes production, we will be able to see
which of these metals have broken the
vicious circle. However, it should again
be pointed out that the relative abun-
dance and relative usefulness of these
metals varies, and each should be treated
individually in assessing economic status.
Beyond the 100-pound to 100-ton
group, there are the truly exotic metals
whose annual production is below 100
pounds per year. These are the metals
with names such as praseodymium, gado-
linium, and dysprosium, remembered by
most engineers only as names or symbols
filling in the gaps in the periodic table.
One of these metals, technetium, is so
rare that its existence in nature has not
been establishd.
More Research Needed
Lack of definite knowledge about the
properties of specific metals in this class
has been a significant barrier to their use
as separate metals. The misch metal, com-
posed of numerous rare earths together,
showed rather disappointing properties,
so little work was done to separate tlu
metals and test them individually. Now
that ion-exchange has replaced fractional
crystallization and precipitation as the
best method for preparation of the pure
metals, a great deal of research has been

commenced.
While the results of this new flurry of
research are just beginning to trickle in,
some surprising facts have come to light.
A number of the rare earths have turned
out to be stronger than expected. Some
have strengths on the same order as the
more common nonferrous metals. Also,
the resistance to atmospheric corrosion
of many of the metals has been better
than expected. They are generally poor
electrical conductors and are strongly
paramagnetic.
Some of the uses, familiar and new,
for the rare earths: in cigarette-lighter
flints, with iron, for better sparking qual-
ities; as deoxidizers and purifiers in fer-
rous alloys; as structural materials in
critical applications, such as rockets, be-
cause of high-temperature passivity; as
superconductors, or in applications where
paramagnetic properties are desirable;
and in nuclear devices, because of their
wide range of thermal neutron cross-
sections.
Even the more common metals which
are customarily used only in alloys are
finding increased use for their own prop-
erties. Zirconium is being tested as a
tubing material in reactors. Vanadium
and tungsten are being fabricated in pure
or slightly-alloyed condition for special
uses, especially in high-temperature or
refractory circumstances.
The use of exotic elemental metals
can be expected to be a major trend in
the future evolution of engineering ma-
terials. A great deal has been done by
metallurgists by recombining the more
familiar metals into new alloys, and the
point has now been reached where new
developments will depend heavily on the
us of heretofore neglected elements. This
is especially true now that many other
considerations besides high strength and
low cost are to be met. The scarce metals
present one of the most promising ave-
nues of solution to the demand for ma-
terials to withstand high temperatures,
corrosive surroundings, and special elec-
trical and magnetic conditions.

CONTROLLED FUSION
The prospects of nearly unlimited fuel supplies
and tremendous quantities of energy, are spur-
ring scientists on in search of a means to control
fusion reactions.
by IRVING SALMEEN
Controlled nuclear fission reactions
are rapidly becoming a common
source of power. Everyone is familiar
with the astounding quantities of energy
that can be squeezed from seemingly
minute proportions of appropriate fuel,
but everyone is not aware of the fact,
that in spite of the apparent efficiency
and enormous energy capacities of
fission reactors, man is approaching a
time in the not too distant future, when
he will face severe problems concerning
sources of energy.
As the supply of fossil fuels dimin-
ishes, greater dependency will have to
be placed upon nuclear energy to meet
the expanding power requirements of
modern society. At the present time the
only feasible method of extracting use-
ful energy from the nucleus of an atom
is by the fission process. But the process
poses two difficult problems. One, when
the uranium deposits begin to run out,
what becomes of the source of fissionable
fuel? Second, the fission reaction leaves
radioactive waste that is nearly impossible
to safely dispose of without contamin-
ating large land or underwater areas.
To illustrate the disposal problem, con-
sider the fact that if the present power
needs of the U.S. were all supplied by fis-
sion reactors, it would be necessory to dis-
pose each year of an amount of radioactive
fission products equal to that from the
explosion of 200,000 atomic bombs, and
by the year 2000, as power requirements
increase, radio-active waste would come
to the equivalent of eight million atomic
bomb explosions per year!
Fusion Principles
Fortunately, fission is not the only
means of releasing the power of the
atom; there is the process of fusion. To
illustrate the difference between fission
and fusion, let us first consider in more
detail the fission reaction. The key ingre-
dients of the process are the nuclei of
certain very heavy elements at the upper
end of the periodic table, such as urani-
um-235 or plutonium. A neutron, because
it has no charge, can easily penetrate
such a nucleus. The presence of a
neutron can cause the nucleus of the
heavy element to split into two roughly
equal parts with the consequent release
of energy. In the process, several addi-
tional neutrons are released, which in
turn cause other nuclei to undergo fission.
If losses of neutrons are minimized, a
sustained chain reaction is possible.
Usable energy is extracted by utilizing
conventional heat exchange methods that
make use of the heat emitted in the pro-
cess to generate electric power.
In the fusion process the basic prin-
ciples are nearly opposite to those of
fission. Here the key ingredients are the
nuclei of certain very light elements that
unite, or fuse, into heavier nuclei with
the subsequent release of energy. The
products of the reaction have less mass
than that of the reactants and this differ-
ence in mass is released in energy accord-
ing to the equation E = mc-. A common
fusion reaction utilizes naturally occurring
deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen with
a mass of 2 amu instead of 1). The
reaction is:
H2 + H- -» He' + n + 33 MeV
(Million electron volts)
or
H2 + H- -&gt; He3 + H1 + 4.0 Mev
where the probability of each reaction
occurring is roughly equal. From this it is
then possible for the trition (H3) to
react with another deuteron:
H3 + H» -&gt; He4 + n + 17.6 MeV
Problems
All looks well for fusion—on paper,
but serious problems arise. It must be
noted that the nuclei involved in the
fusion reactions are positively charged.
As a result, strong electrostatic repulsion
forces exist between particles. However,
before a fusion reaction can occur, the
particles must be brought into contact,
a feat that requires tremendous amounts
of energy.
Suppose we have an imaginary con-
tainer of deuterium and want to gen-
erate a fusion reaction. To give the par-
ticles sufficient kinetic energy to over-
come the electrostatic repulsion, we heat
the deuterium. At a temperature of
5,000°C we observe our container and
note that the particles are in a wild ran-
dom motion, no fusion reactions occur,
but the molecules of deuterium have
broken apart and the container now holds
just deuterium atoms. At this tempera-
ture a liter of original deuterium at atmos-
pheric temperature would exert a press-
ure of 40 atmospheres and each particle
would have a velocity of, on the average,
40,000 miles per hour.
We continue the heating until a tem-
perature of 100,000 degrees is reached.
Again we observe the state of the deuter-
ium. (Because our container is imagin-
ary, it can stand the high temperatures
and pressures.) Still no fusion reactions
occur, but now the atoms of deuterium
have broken into a neutral conglomera-
tion of positive ions and electrons. At this
temperature, the electrons surrounding
the nucleus of the atoms have acquired
sufficient energy to break away and now
violently move about the container at an
average velocity of 10 million miles per
hour, while the heavier nuclei lag along

ions had changed the sufferer's symptoms.
There's nothing new or mysterious
about the ion. Over a period of years
there have been reports to the effect that
positive and negative ions produce oppo-
site physiological effects. Negative ions
have been claimed to produce beneficial
effects while positive ions generally have
been considered harmful. The use of con-
centrated negative ions to treat "hayfever"
and asthma is only part of a sweeping
program of medical developments that
promise relief for victims of a wide range
of chronic ailments.
The Ions We Breathe
Ions, both negative and positive, occur
naturally in the outdoor atmosphere.
These ions range in size from a molecule
with a single charge to a large particle
with multiple charges. The size of these
ions is expressed in terms of their velocity
in an electrostatic field of known force.
The removal of an electron from a par-
ticle will yield a positive ion while the
addition of an electron will form a nega-
tive ion.

their charge and mobility vary consider-
ably. Clean mountain air has about 2,000
small ions/ cm3, while polluted air may
have thousands of low mobility ions with
only a few small ions/ cm3. These ions
in the atmosphere are generated in a num-
ber of ways including cosmic rays, radio-
active elements in the earth, precipita-
tion, winds, and ultraviolet radiation.
Negative Ions in Medical Research
Medical men have long suspected that
ions affected the human system, but only
until recently have they solved the riddle
of ion research. As far back as 1924
when Picard was using an ultraviolet
lamp inside an aluminum sphere, the
effects of ions on respiratory ailments
were noticed. For the past thirty years,
Dessauer has been using about one mil-
lion negative ions/ml for the treatment
of climatic-sensitive individuals. Recently
Dr. I. Kornblueh at the University of
Pennsylvania reported relief of "hay-
fever" in many individuals treated with a
concentration of negative ions. Negative
ions have also been proven beneficial in
the treatment of burns and the ever pres-
ent common cold. They have had a great
influence in the reduction of malignant
tissue in cases of implanted cancer cells
in mice.
The most significant discovery in ion
research concerns the filter for dust and
smoke in the human body. Located in
the windpipe, there exists thousands of
tiny hair-like filaments, called cilia,
which wave back and forth to capture
irritating particles from the air we
breathe. Under ordinary conditions, these
dust traps wave their "arms" about 850
times per minute. In experiments con-
ducted by Dr. Albert Kruger at the
ULTRAVIOLET

applied to the metals surface.
University of California, when cilia were
exposed to negative ions, their vibrations
speeded up at the rate of two hundred
beats per minute. An opposite effect was
observed when cilia were exposed to pos-
itive ions. A correlation between the
vibration rate of the cilia and the relief
of respiratory ailments has now been
drawn.
Artificial Generation of Ions
Indoors, ions can be generated in
any number of ways, including x-rays,
radio active materials, and certain ultra-
violet lamps. The most exhaustive in-

vestigations with ions concern magnesium
oxide which, when heated to a high tem-
perature, produces both positive and
negative ions. The positive ions are then
removed by an electro-static field. Radio-
active materials also release both posi-
tive and negative ions where the posi-
tive ions arc removed in a similar man-
ner.
Ultraviolet generators can be made to
produce only negative ions, but the lamp
itself cannot produce a substantial num-
ber. Even the shortest wave length pro-
duced by ultraviolet lamps, 1849 Ang-
stroms, does not have sufficient energy to
ionize oxygen or nitrogen. However,
ultraviolet lamps can produce ions in an
indirect manner; the radiation can cause
liberation of electrons from a nearby-
metal or certain other materials, and
these electrons can attach themselves to
oxygen or dust particles forming negative
ions (see Fig. 1)! The number of elec-
trons released by this process depends
on the intensity and wavelength of radia-
tion, as well as the material used to
emit the electrons.
The methods by which this radiation
can be controlled involve the parameters

pressure, current density, etc.). By vary-
ing these parameters, the amount of

potassium, are unstable in air and cannot
be used. Metals, such as aluminum, oxi-
dizes readly in air. Fortunately, the high
work functions of some of the more-
stable metals can be decreased by thj
proper combinations of other metals.
For example, a layer of silver plate on
copper aids in the ejection of electrons,
because this layer of electropositive ions
acts much like the grid of a thermionic
tube. A negative voltage on the metal
surface increases the concentration of
ions, primarily because electrons ejected
from the surface are repelled and are
thus prevented from recombining with
the metal (this is shown in Fig. 2).
Other factors which effect the efficiency
of ion production involve air flow. If this
flow in the generator (see fig. 3) is
turbulent, many ions are lost to the in-
side surfaces of the generator; thus a
rapid, smooth flow is essential.
Measurement of Air Ion Concentration
Air ions are negatively or positively
charged molecules or dust particles. The
number of unit charges of electricity in
the air can be determined by measuring
the current or charge on a collector. A
single dust particle with many unit
charges would, under these conditions,
be recorded as many single air ions.
Differentiation between large, medium,
and small air ions are made on the basis
of their mobility. Large singly charged
dirt particles when placed in an electric
field would move at approximately
0.0003 cm/sec/volt/ cm; intermediate
size ions would move at approximately
o.l cm sec volt/cm; while small ions
on the average will move at 1.5 cm/sec/
volt cm. Here mobility is expressed as:
One way of determining the number o(
ions per unit volume of air is to draw
the air with a suction fan between the
collecting plates and measure the current
with a microammeter. The number of
ions, N, can be expressed as
I
qA
Where: I = ion current in amperes
q = 1.6 x 10 '" coulombs
A = Vol. of air/sec.
The Future
While much research needs to be done
in this area, particularily toward deter-
mining the precise mechanism by which
ions react with the human body, the
over 60 years of experimentation in this
field have produced some ideas on the
effect of charged ions. Our indoor air
is now controlled in temperature and
humidity, dust is removed by electrostatic
precipitation, and bacteria are killed by
ultraviolet radiation. The next step will
be the control of the ion count.

IT'S HERE-IF YOU WANT TO WORK FOR IT"
Even before Ron Spetrino received his engi-
neering degree from Case he had good job offers
from six companies.
He joined The Ohio Bell Telephone Company
—his reason: "I was convinced an engineer could
go further here—if he was willing to work for it."
As soon as Ron got his feet on the ground
in telephone engineering, he was tapped for a
tough assignment. The job—to engineer switch-
ing equipment modifications needed to prepare
Cleveland for nationwide customer dialing of long
distance calls.
Ron wrapped it up in five months, and found
he had earned a shot at another tough assignment.
In this job Ron helped engineer a completely new
long distance switching center for Cleveland. This
switching center connected Cleveland with the
nationwide customer dialing network. It was
about a year later that Ron put the finishing
touches on the specs for this $1,600,000 project.
Today, as a Supervising Engineer, Ron heads
a staff of five engineers and is responsible for
telephone switching in much of the greater
Cleveland area.
He supervises the design and purchase of $3
million worth of equipment a year. And even
more important, he is charged with developing
the technical and managerial skills of his staff.
Ron knows what he's talking about when he
says, "In this business you have to do more than
a good job. We expect a man to be a self-developer.
We expect him to take responsibility from his
first day on the job and think for himself. You
don't get ahead around here by just doing time."

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&amp;WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt &amp; Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you doll—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can flourish.
For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,
Engineering Department, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft,
East Hartford 8, Connecticut.

At P&amp;WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab-
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused
on the development of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this live mock-up
of a reactor, nuclear scientists and engineers can
determine critical mass, material reactivity coefficients,
control effectiveness and other reactor parameters.

Representative of electronic aids functioning for P&amp;WA
engineers is this on-site data recording center which
can provide automatically recorded and computed
data simultaneously with the testing of an engine. This
equipment is capable of recording 1,200 different
values per second.

Studies of solar energy collection and liquid and vapor
power cycles typify P&amp;WA's research in advanced
space auxiliary power systems. Analytical and Experi-
mental Engineers work together in such programs to
establish and test basic concepts.

Seemingly insignificant geological specimens
can yield many facts about the condition of the
earth eons ago.
by CHARLES MASSER
Have you ever wondered how the
Earth appeared in the year
100,000,000 B.C.? To many of us, the
reconstruction of the Earth's history is
just as interesting as the construction of
the Earth's future. How do we recon-
struct a past picture of the Earth? One-
approach to the problem came from the
idea of finding which areas of the Earth
in its past history were under water or
vice versa. However, this does not pro-
vide sufficient knowledge to enable one
to construct a map valid for the year
100,000,000 B.C. All of the facts that
are known about existing rocks and the
fossils they contain must be used to
unravel the past. The men who step
into this work are called paleogeograph-
ers or historical geologists.
Fossil Bearing Rocks Form Theory
Fossils tell us many things that are
necessary in constructing a historical pic-
ture of the Earth. They can tell us what
land-bridges and water-channels existed,
what type of climate prevailed in a cer-
tain region, or they may tell of how the
ocean currents flowed. However, to show
when the opening or closing of these
land-bridges occurred, the fossils of
larger land animals must be used. This
is true because flying animals and in-
sects can be blown across a broken land-
bridge, small land animals could ride
across on driftwwood, and seeds could
cross the waterway by wind or be carried
across by birds. However, the large land
animals would be restricted to the main-
land around them, because it would be
impossible for them to cross the wide
stretches of water before them.
In this way we can follow the devel-
opment of land animals and determine
whether or not any two land areas
were ever connected in the past. We
know North and South America were
separated throughout the first half of
the Cenozoic Era (Age of Mammals),
but about the end of the Miocene (the
Dinosaur Age) the Isthmus of Panama
rose above sea level allowing animals to
cross between the two continents. That
is why today we find armadillas in Tex-
as and jaguars in Brazil.
Most geologists who have studied the
fossil evidence in the main land masses
agree that during the Cenozoic Era (about
ten million B.C. years ago) the main
land masses have not moved, however,
the changing level of the oceans has
opened and closed many land-bridges.
During the past 50 million years land-
bridges at the Bering Straits, Panama,
Suez, and an Australian-Asian bridge via
New Guinea have occurred. In the last
case the Austrailian-Asian bridge could
not have been open since the age of
Reptile since there are no placental mam-
mals found in Australia.
Early Reconstruction Becomes
More Vague
Before the Cenozoic Era- there is less
information to consider, but there are
some reasons to suspect that a direct land
connection joined the southern continents
via Antarctica. To understand many of
the geological theories that explain his-
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIG


an understanding of how the Earth is
constructed.
As one proceeds down through
the crust of the Earth the tem-
perature increases. At about 75-100
miles below the surface the pressure and
temperature are so great that the rock
becomes molten and is called magma.
The solid crust above the magma is di-
vided into two types, "Sima" and "Sial."
The "Sima" is the denser of the two and
is comprised of mostly silicon and mag-
nesium salts. The "Sial" is lighter and
contains mostly silicon and aluminum
salts. These two types of rocks are not
distributed evenly over our globe; as a
matter of fact, the continents are large
masses of sial "floating" on a sea of
sima. A similar example is an iceburg
floating on the ocean and, like the ice-
berg, ninety percent of the continents
are submerged in the sima. Therefore
where sial material is found, one mav
suspect that that area may have been the
site of a large land area. The one excep-
tion is islands that are formed by vol-
canic action, which are of sima material.
Locating Lost Continents
To find the areas of sima and sial that
have been lost to the sea, geologists use
the speed of earthquake vibrations. In
studying these vibrations they have found
that the greatest areas of sima are lo-
cated in the Central Pacific and Southern
Indian and Artie oceans. These areas
are called "permanent" oceans because
no continents are expected to be discov-
ered from past, nor are they expected to
be formed in present or future. The great
submarine mountain ranges where a lost
continent might have existed, lie in the
Southwest Pacific and the Northwest In-
dian Oceans. Because the Atlantic Ocean
is mostly sima with a little sial around
the Canaries and Madeira Islands, it is
a likely guess that these islands were
once part of a large peninsula that ex-
tended in a northwest direction from
Africa.
Three Schools of Thought Prevail
The geologists of today fall into three
schools of thought: those who favor the
stable-continent theory, those who back
the transoceanic-continent idea, and those
who advance the continental-drift theory.
The stable-continent school believes in
no sunken continents, only slight in-
movements of the existing land to open
and close narrow land-bridges. The
transoceanic-continent school believes
that the continents are of constant shape
and size but that they drift on the sur-
face of the Earth.
The transoceanic-continent school be-
gan about I860 when a geologist by the
name of Blanford pointed out the like-
ness between rock and fossil deposits
in South Africa and India. He inferred
that South Africa and India had once
been connected by a large land-bridge
that included the island of Madascar.
Later this theory was broadened to in-
clude the great land-bridge between South
America and Africa.
In the 1880's the Austrian geologist
Edward Suess formed the transoceanic-
continent school. In his opinion, during
the Paleozoic Era (200,000,000 B.C.)
there was one large continent in the
Southern Hemisphere which he called
Gondwanaland, and two smaller conti-
nents in the Northern Hemisphere. How-
ever, many geologists object to this idea
because if this vast continent described
by Suess were present it would have dis-
placed enough water to submerge the
other two continents completely.
Many American geologists take the
middle of the road in the above two
theories. They tend to picture the con-
nections between the continents as small
"isthmian links" instead of the broad,,
ocean filling, continental links as de-
scribed by Suess.
That leaves the continental-drift the-
ory which was proposed by Alfred Wege-
ner. Working on the theory that the
continents floated on a layer of sima, he
stated in his theory that a single super
continent existed in the Paleozoic Era.
This large mass of land broke apart in
the Mcsozoic Era and drifted apart in
the Pleistocene Period. However Wege-
ner's theory has fatal flaws. The Paleon-
tologist object because the distribution
of animals proves that Europe and North
America were separated before the Meso-
zoic Era. Another objection is the force
required to move these continents. A
geophysicist by the name of Lambert
calculated the force and found the con-
tinents were only one millionth the size
required to produce such a force. And,
by the way, how could continents made
of light and comparatively week sial,
plow through the denser and stronger
sima?
Geologists Do Agree on Many Ideas
Even though the geologigsts differ they
agree on many things; there may have
been lost continents in the Paleozoic Era
(200 million B.C.) when the highest
life consisted of lizard like reptiles. How-
ever, these continents were not real con-
tinents but narrow isthmuses connecting
present day land masses. And if these
continents ever existed they lost their
shape during the Mesozoic Era.
These changes that took place were
so gradual that none of these continents
could possibly have lasted to within mil-
lions of years of the time of man. They
also agree that a new and true explana-
tion may come to light and perhaps it
may combine features of several of the
older theories, and who knows it may
still come in our lifetime.

With the increased amount of discov-
eries about the atom, there arises a need
for newer and better equipment to study
this building block of the universe. Such
is no exception at Michigan. To replace
the cyclotron that was build in the base-
ment of Randal Laboratory is the new
14-30 million electron volt machine un-
der construction on North Campus. This
month Michigan Education and Research
describes the core of this new cyclotron.
Also featured are clips on a new medical
research project and an improvement on
the newly developed Ruby Maser ampli-
fier.
New Cyclotron Core
The magnet core of a variable energy
cyclotron, weighing an estimated 310
tons, has been shipped from Bethlehem
Steel Company's Bethlehem, Pa., plant
to the Physics Department of The Uni-
versity of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
Built for the University under a con-
tract with the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, the "atom smasher," when opera-
tional in 1963, will be used for research
on the nuclei of the heavier elements.
When completed, the cyclotron will have
a continuously variable energy range of
15 to 40 million electron-volts. It will be
housed in a new $1.1 million laboratory
facility now under construction on the
University's North Campus.
The heaviest individual parts of the
magnet core are the top and bottom mem-
bers of the magnet frame, also called the
yoke. Each weighs approximately 105
tons. When joined with vertical span-
ners by large dowel pins and studs, they
form a magnet frame measuring 224
inches long, 83 inches wide, and 143
inches high. The magnet poles, top and
bottom, will be located within this mag-
net frame.
Forged, machined and completely as-
sembled at the Bethlehem plant, the mag-
net core components for the cyclotron
were fabricated on some of the largest
planers and vertical boring mills in the
country. Specifications required the fin-
ishing of these components to thou-
sandths and micro inches.
A cyclotron is primarily a research in-
strument which permits physicists to alter
the atomic nucleus in order to study
nuclear phenomena. It does this by ac-
celerating protons or the nuclei of other
light-weight atoms until they have
enough speed to penetrate the nuclei of
target atoms. The protons are injected
into the center of an evacuated tank en-
closing the gap between pole tips in the
magnet core. The paths of the protons
are curved by the strong magnetic field,
so that they spiral from the center out-
ward, making many revolutions in the
field. Each time around they receive an
accelerating "kick." Near the periphery
of the tank, where they have attained a
speed of approximatly 15 that of light.
they are pulled out of the tank and direct-
ed at a target. Having tremendous energy,
the protons break the target atom and
induce changes which, when studied with
an array of electrical instruments, en-
able scientists to piece together the intri-
cate details of nuclear reactions.
An unusual feature in the design ol
this cyclotron core is an air gap of one-
half inch between pole and pole tip, in
each of the two poles forming the magnet
core. The poles of the cyclotron are ol
the spiral ridge type. This term refers to
the shape of the magnet field inside the
air gap—a magnetic field with propertie'-
that enable the emerging particles to bf
focused better than with the more conven-
tional uniform field cyclotron. This
unique feature permits higher particle
energy as well as better control of the
energy.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


University of Michigan physicists and
engineers are beginning a program to
design and build a radiotelescope ampli-
fier which they expect will be perhaps
ten times more sensitive than any other
in the world.
The 1st Solid-State Physics Laboratory,
which will do the research on the new
ruby maser amplifier, designed and built
the maser now operating on the Univer-
sity's 85-foot radio telescope at Peach
Mountain, some 14 miles northwest of
here. The Laboratory's scientists believe
this amplifier is probably the most sensi-
tive in the world. With it, U-M radio
astronomers made the world's first un-
ambiguous records of natural radio emis-
sions from the planet Saturn and from
a planetary nebula (dying star). Besides
making the new amplifier some ten times
more sensitive, the group also will make
it much simpler to operate and more re-
liable.
A ruby maser—which uses a synthetic-
ruby crystal as the sensitive element—
requires liquid helium to cool the crys-
tal to just a few degrees above absolute
zero, the coldest anything can get. Where-
as the present system requires that liquid
helium be poured in before each opera-
tion, the new one will have "closed-cycle
refrigeration" which will require only
infrequent filling. Not only will it thus
be possible for one man to operate the

use at the Peach
amplifier, but its reliability is expected
to be increased also. This is one of sev-
eral improvements the group expects to
make.
The new radiometer is expected to
have the following approximate operat-
ing characteristics:
Signal frequency 9,000 mc, sex
Gain (maser) 23 db
Bandwidth (maser)
Equivalent noise tem-
perature (excluding
antenna)
Threshold rms tem-
perature (10-s:c
integration time)
100 mc/sec
30 degrees K
.003 degrees K

U-M's Giant Cyclotron "Heart"—The variable energy "atom smasher" now under
construction on north campus will have as its "heart" this 310-ton magnet core
now enroute to the U-M. The cyclotron will have a range of 15 to 40
million volts when completed in 1963.
The development of an advanced maser
radiometer will require improvement
both in the performance characteristics
of the maser amplifier and in the over-all
characteristics of the system.
The 1ST research program will se?k
to evolve improved cavity designs and
coupling methods. The- Solid-State Phys-
ics Laboratory has already produced a
simple, versatile silvered ruby maser
cavity which yields voltage gain-band-
width products in excess of 300 mc s c
under field conditions. These produ-.ts
are about three times higher than the
best previous cavity maser systems.
Improvement in the over-all perform-
ance characteristics of the system will re-
quire primarily the use of input compo-
nents cooled to liquid helium tempera-
ture. To reduce the noise temperature
further and increase the gain stability,
the system design will include a helium
temperature-comparison load to estab-
lish a standard reference temperature-,
and low-temperature loads on all spare
circulator ports. An improved horn de-
sign will be sought to reduce the effect-
ive antenna temperature.

Space Image Tube
When Uvicon, a new electronic imag-
ing tube, is placed on a vehicle in space,
it will enable scientists to learn more
about the stars and the depths of inter-
stellar space. The tube is sensitive to the
short wave length ultraviolet light rays
that are emitted by celestial bodies but
never reach the surface of the earth since
they are screened by the atmosphere.
Uvicon is an extremely sensitive image-
tube operating in the range from 1200 to
2000 angstroms. The tube is about two
inches in diameter, twelve inches long
and weighs about eight ounces.
In operation, the Uvicon receives an
ultraviolet image through a special win-
dow, made of lithium fluoride, mounted
at the input end of the tube. The back
surface of the window is coated with a
photo-emitting material that releases elec-
trons when the ultraviolet image strikes
it. These electrons are accelerated by
15,000 volts toward the rear end of the
tube, where they strike a thin film or
target.
The impact of the electrons on the
target causes it to take on an amplified
electrical charge in the exact pattern of
the ultraviolet image. The next step is
to read off this charge as an electrical
signal and thus reproduce the image
electrically. This is done by scanning the
rear surface of the target with a beam of
electrons, much as an electron beam scans

outer space research.
the viewing end of a television picture
tube. In the Uvicon, however, the prod-
uct of the scanning is an electrical "im-
age" that can be amplified and broadcast,
rather than a visual image that can be
seen directly. The over-all technique is
known as electron bombardment in-
duced conductivity.
Uvicon was developed at the Astro-
physical Observatory of the Smithsonian
Institution, for the Observatory's Proj-
ect Celescope. It is one of several experi-
ments planned to be launched in the
National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration's (NASA) orbiting astronomi-
cal observatory program. NASA has
announced that the first of the orbiting
observatories is planned for 1963.
"NASA will launch a series of
rockets from its Wallops Station, Va.,
site, employing the Aerobee-Hi rocket,
to place the Uvicon and its associated
electronic equipment well beyond the
absorbing portion of the earth's atmos-
phere. The purpose is to sample the
strength and nature of the ultraviolet
radiations we will encounter and to get
preliminary data on the performance of
the entire Project Celescope electronic
telescope system."
Essentially, this telescope consists of
three components: (1) an optical ar-
rangement to form the ultraviolet im-
ages; (2) a Uvicon pick-up tube and
its associated circuitry, which constitute
a TV camera that responds to the ultra-
violet images and converts them into
electrical signals; and (3) a transmitter
to broadcast these signals back dow^n to
earth. Thus, in television fashion, scien-

and interstellar space that always has
been screened from man's vision.
The ultraviolet telescope package will
go into the noose cone of an Aerobee-Hi
rocket, which will take it to an altitude
of about 150 miles. The useful portion
of the flight will be the five minutes spent
above an altitude of 60 miles, which is
the height at which the ultraviolet radi-
ations of interest cease to be absorbed.
At this height the protective front por-
tion of the nose cone will be jettisoned
and the telescope exposed to the skies.
Information on brightness of stars
will be telemetered to electronic storage
equipment on the ground for final analy-
sis of stellar magnitudes. In addition,
the presence of sources of ultraviolet
radiation in interstellar space will be
recorded.
T.V. Helps
Television has helped an astronomer
to record the light (picked-up by the
University of Arizona 36-inch telescope)
issuing from the Globula Cluster M 15
tens of thousands of years ago. Television
is said to be more sensitive than a pho-
tographic plate by a factor of 50 to 100—
in other words, exposures have to be
50-to-100 times longer with photography.
Thus, television makes it possible to take
many more pictures.
Fastest- Air Blast
Plans to utilize a series of the world's
fastest operating air blast power circuit-
breakers to help protect a 345,000-volt
transmission network have been an-
nounced.
The breakers will be the first air blast

Transparent Shock Tube
Head-on collision of two shock waves
traveling 80 times faster than sound has
been achieved in a hydromagnetic tube
made of glass. Scientists developed this
unusual use for glass piping in a study
of high temperature gases.
The glass tube is 12 feet long and 6
inches in diameter. Scientists believe it is
the largest tube ever used in an experi-
ment of this kind.
Because the tube is transparent, still
photographs can be taken of the collid-
ing shock waves. At impact, the Pyrex
piping is brightly illuminated. The naked
eye catches only a brief flash, but the
camera with shutter left open in a dark-
ened room records the collision. The
flash is accompanied by a loud report
similar to an exploding firecracker.
Studies growing out of the shock tube
program could have important results in
the development of effective ion and
plasma-propulsion systems. The tube is
expected to be useful in measuring tem-
peratures of gases up to several million
degrees. It also will be used in the study
of microwave emission and energy loss
through radiation.
The shock waves are driven through
the glass piping by a surge of electrical
power equal to the output of four Grand
Coulee Dams. The electrical energy used
to create the waves is stored in two 20-
capacitor banks rated at 20,000 volts
with a combined peak power of between
2,500,000 and 5,000,000 kilowatts.
Once triggered, the shocks last only a
few microseconds, but create a gas tem-
perature within the tube of approximately
one million degrees.
The thermal as well as the magnetic
energy in the electrical discharge creates
shock waves which initially race along at
300 times the speed of sound. After
traveling about 60 inches toward the
center of the tube, however, both shock
waves are "slowed'' to about 80 times
the speed of sound—still more than two
dozen times the speed of a rifle bullet.
Through the glass, the velocity of the
shock waves and spectra of radiation
from the gas are recorded with a high-
speed rotating mirror camera. A new
vacuum ultraviolet grating spectrograph
—a device for separating light into its
components—is also being used to eval-
uate the data.

Inco Nickel helps give engineers the solution
to metal problems in new radio telescope
How do you design a precision instru-
ment that will "see" 38 billion light
years into space? This problem was
answered by the engineers working
on this revolutionary, new radio
telescope.
But these engineers faced another
challenging problem — How do you
actually build it? How do you build
a telescope as tall as a 66-story build-
ing with a reflector so big it could
hold six football fields?
How do you build a rotating mecha-
nism that can swing this giant up or
down, or sideways, to aim at any spot
in the Universe with pin-point accu-
racy? Just the tiniest amount of wear
or distortion in this mechanism could
throw the telescope millions of miles
off target in the far reaches of space!
Where could they get construction
materials tough and strong enough?
Nickel gave them the answer! Nickel
in steel gave these engineers a mate-
rial tough enough to maintain pre-
cision in the rotating mechanism even
under the anticipated 20,000-ton load.
And Nickel, to be used in the steel
members, gave them the high strength
at minimum weight needed to sup-
port the giant reflector.
The radio telescope is one of the
many developments in which Nickel
has solved important problems. Most
probably you, yourself, in the near
future, will be faced with problems
just as difficult. When you are, you can
count on Nickel —and the cooperation
of Inco — to help get the job done ...
and done right!

Pinch effect occurs when a large elec-
tric current is sent through a plasma
in a cylinder. Circular magnetic lines
of force set up by the current contract
and pinch the plasma into a narrow
channel (dark colored column).
at a mere 170,000 miles per hour. At this
temperature pressure has risen to 1,500
atmospheres. The gas that now exists in
the container is called a plasma.
Finally we reach the fantastic tempera-
ture of one million degrees! The pressure-
has reached a value of 1.5 million atmos-
pheres and the electrons are traveling at
a 90,000 miles per second while the
deuterons at 1,500 miles per second. At
this temperature the nuclei have finally
acquired sufficient energy to overcome
electrostatic repulsion, but still a signifi-
cant number of fusion reactions do not
occur because the number of direct colli-
sions is not enough and also because
many of the collisions result in deflec-
tions and scattering. Not until a tempera-
ture of 350,000,000 degrees will the
conditions be right for a sustained ther-
monuclear reaction.
The previous description sounds like
pure science fiction, but it is actually
not as impossible as it first appears to be.
When the high temperatures are men-
(Continued from page 17)
tioned, the immediate thought is to re-
late this to heat content. However, this
is not the case. In reality this tempera-
ture is a measure of kinetic energy, i.e.
the temperatures necessary to impart the
required amounts of kinetic energy to
the particles. To illustrate this, consider
the fact that, theoretically, for a sustained
reaction to occur the densities of the
plasma must be about 101"' to 10" par-
ticles per centimeter, or about one ten-
thousandth of standard atmospheric den-
sity. With such a thin fuel, the tempera-
ture would be very hot in terms of speed
of its particles, but the actual heat con-
tent would be low. A liter of deuterium
plasma at a kinetic temperature of 350
million degrees, would have an actual
heat content of about 18,000 calories,
just enough to heat a small cup of coffee.
Although the previous statements lead
one to believe that the plasma can be
easily confined, this is not necessarily
true. At such a high temperature, the
mean free paths of the particles are far
greater than any practical material con-
tainer. For fusion to occur, the high kin-
etic temperature must be maintained, but
any material container could not possi-
bly confine the plasma without particles
colliding with the walls of the container.
Such collisions would result in a loss of
energy and the particles would be cooled
below the critical temperature. Thus, the
first practical problem in the design of a
reactor would be a method of confining
the plasma.
Confinement
At the present time, the most prac-
tical method of confinement appears to
be by a magnetic field. It is a common
fact that the charged particles will be
acted on by the force of an applied
electromagnetic field. A charged par-
ticle of mass m (grams) moving with a
velocity v (cm/sec) perpendicular to i
magnetic field B (gauss) will be forced
into a circular path of radius r
SB
where q is the charge on the particle
(electromagnetic units.) Any velocity
component parallel to the magnetic field
is unaffected by the field, thus the par-
ticle will move in a spiral path about the
magnetic field lines.
Consider a long cylindrical tube with a
magnetic field parallel to the axis, and
into this tube are introduced some
charged particles. The particles cannot
move out into the walls because they arc
constrained by the magnetic field, but
they can move freely along the field lines.
Applying this to the hot plasma, we can
see that although the velocity of the
particles is tremendous, the velocity is
restricted to one direction by the mag-
netic field. Collisions with material walls
would no longer be a problem because a
sufficiently strong field would confine the
gas even at 350 million degrees. We
now have a possible method of confine-
ment, but now the problem arises: how
to set up the field.

necessary fields. One is to use an ex-
ternal coil carrying a current, the other
is to use the self-magnetic field created
by causing a large current to flow
through the plasma. Consider the latter
method.
The current flowing in the plasma cre-
ates the lines of magnetic flux whose di-

rection is determined by the right-hand
rule. (See fig. 1.) The strongest field is
immediately outside the plasma and if
the plasma current is all on the surface,
the field immediately falls to zero at the
surface and there is no magnetic field
inside. The plasma at the boundry experi-
ences an inward force which is propor-
tional to the square of the magnetic in-
duction and tends to constrict or pinch
the plasma. This is known as the pinch
effect.
If the magnetic field or the plasma is
displaced, say in the form of a small
kink, the magnetic field lines are shifted.
(See fig. 2.) The magnetic field increases
below the kink and decreases above, hence
the displacement increases. This displace-
ment increases until the magnetic contain-
ment is distorted to the point where it is
driven into the walls of the container
that isolate the plasma. Several modified
systems have corrected this effect, but
other problems arose that make the pinch
effect difficult to utilize on an experi-
mental device.
Stellarator
The alternative solution to the prob-
lem of the field has brought about the
invention of a device called the stellara-
tor. (Fig. 3) Developed oy Dr. Lyman
field necessarily varies as 1 R where R is
the radius of the torus. As a consequence
of this field variation with distance from
the axis of symmetry there is a strong
tendency for the particles to drift across
the field instead of being confined by it.
Positive ions drift up, electrons drift
down, and a vertical electric field is cre-
ated. The electrons are prevented by the
magnetic field from moving to neutralize
this charge accumulation. As a result the
whole plasma drifts at right angles to
both the electric and magnetic fields. One
solution to this problem was to twist the
torus into a figure eight, however, addi-
tional and more complex problems arose.
Up-to Date
To date a sustained controlled reaction
has not been achieved. All of the theory
and experiments are presently aimed at
the problems of confining the plasma.
Once containment has been perfected,
then other problems such as heating,
power extraction, and devising a com-
mercial reactor will be tackled. This
short excursion into the maze-like world
of fusion control can just barely intro-
duce the reader to the infinite complex-
ities of fusion reactions, but for a mo-
ment let us look into the future and
glance at some of the advantages of
fusion power. A commercial reactor will
be very large, probably a centralized pow-
er installation with a size on the order
of a typical power dam. On the basis of
present knowledge, the pocket sized
reactor will be out of the question.
The source of fuel will be virtually
unlimited. Although only a small fraction
of water is deuterium, (water will be
the main source of fuel), still the deuter-
ium in one gallon of water has the
energy equivalent of 350 gallons of
gasoline. If a deuterium reactor were
operating at an efficiency of 10%, it
would unlock 101" kilowatt years of use-
ful energy using only one-half of the
total amount of deuterium in the oceans
of the world. At the present rate of pow-
er consumption, this would provide
energy for the next 100 billion years!
In addition to the attractive quantities
of available power, there are no dis-
posal problems—the only wastes are in-
ert gases. Better still, fuel will be cheap.
The cost of extracting deuterium from
sea water will be less than one percent
as expensive as mining coal.
As one can see the rewards are great,
and the problems even greater. Various
predictions have been made, concerning
the speed with which fusion control will
come about, that range from 20 to 50
years. It seems likely to assume that as
more people become involved in research
and as countries of the world pool their
resources, it is possible that fusion power
will be available long before fossil and
fission fuels are exhausted.

Advanced power conversion systems
for space vehicles utilizing energy of the sun or
heat from a nuclear reactor are now being devel-
oped by Garrett's AiResearch divisions. Under
evaluation are dynamic and static systems which
convert heat into a continuous electrical power
supply for space flight missions of extended dura-
tion. Component and material developments for
these systems are being advanced in the fields of
liquid metals, heat transfer, nonmechanical and
turboelectric energy conversion, turbomachinery,
alternators and controls.
Besides solar and nuclear power systems for
space applications, other product areas at Garrett
include small gas turbine engines, environmental
systems for advanced flight vehicles, cryogenic

fluid systems and controls, pneumatic valves and
controls and missile accessory power units.
This diversification of project areas enables
the engineer at Garrett to specialize or diversify
according to his interest, not only making work
more interesting but increasing the opportunities
for responsibility and advancement.
An orientation program lasting several months
is available for the newly graduated engineer,
working on assignments with highly experienced
engineers in laboratory, preliminary design and
development projects. In this way his most profit-
able areas of interest can be found.

The £Jitot'i Pen -
Recently I overheard a conversation between a freshman, who
had been in Ann Arbor for several months, and a local citizen of
25 years' residency. It was a rainy, windy day, and the student
remarked to the effect, "Well, this is certainly Ann Arbor weather
for you—storm, storm, storm". The citizen chuckled, and said,
"I've been hearing the same thing from the freshman classes all
my life. What makes you think the weather is really any worse here
than any place else in the midwest?"
Today I called the U-M Meterology Lab in an attempt to get
an answer to this question. As I suspected, the plain fact is that
Ann Arbor weather is in all respects typical of the weather of the
Great Lakes region. The topography, I'm told, has no influence.
Consequently, I was led to wonder at length about students'
attitudes toward their adopted city. Of course, the old principle that
"the grass always looks greener" applies in part. But I feel that i
good deal of student opinion about the city is colored by the fact
that they are living away from home, family and friends; that they
do not know the city as well as their home city; that many come
from much larger or much smaller communities, with different
atmospheres; and that for several other reasons, their residenq
here is off on the wrong foot to begin with, independent of the
town's qualities.
I have accumulated about seven years' Ann Arbor residency,
both as a student and as a nonstudent, and I have been working
on a course project that brings me into contact with various city
planning officials. I have become somewhat fond of Ann Arbor,
and would like to defend her to my readers.
First, the weather. If the records show it is typical of the region,
who has a legitimate gripe? Those who go to school in the Great
Lakes region should be prepared for Great Lakes weather—which
is actually better than weather in many, many regions.
Next, the planning and government of the city: I have found
the city's administrators apparently very skilled and competent.
Criticisms of city policy with regard to traffic, one-way streets, etc,
should be made with reservation, because these policies result from
far greater experience, concern, and skill than any student would be
expected to have. The same is true of almost any city policy. Granted
that criticism is desirable and often may be quite helpful, but gen-
erally the city's practices are soundly based and reasonable.
The overwhelming virtue of this town, however, arises from
its being the seat of an important university. Here in Ann Arbor
there is a concentration of wealth and of intellect rearely found
elsewhere. We have a rare collection of cultural, economic, and
interest features. If only the student body used them more exten-
sively! Then would they appreciate this great little burg properly.
These remarks are addresseed to a minority—the gripers and
complainers. Just the same, I feel the general attitude of the stu-
dent toward the town is a bit more negative than is justifiable.

HIGH ENERGY SPARKS
Recent investigations have brought about the
development and application of electric sparks
more powerful than lightning.
By IRVING SALMEEN
Associate Editor
Nature's high energy spark, pho-
tographed during a typical thun-
derstorm.
For centuries man's curiosity has lead
him to investigate the many natur-
al phenomena that influence his environ-
ment. One of the oldest of these is
lightning. Very early in his investigation,
he had the opportunity to witness the
blinding flash and the display of tremen-
dous power as a bolt splintered a large
tree. The eighteenth and nineteenth cen-
turies produced many men who carried
on basic experiments that lead to an un-
derstanding of the nature of lighting
and electrical discharges.
Among the results of the investiga-
tions was the development of various ap-
paratus, which opened the field of mod-
ern electronics, that utilized the effects
of an electric discharge through gases at
low pressures. However, few have stud-
ied the effects of the same electric dis-
charge through a gas at high pressures.
In fact, literature on the subject pub-
lished before the mid-1950's is most dif-
ficult to procure.
Previous to the midtwentieth century,
only two important applications had
been found for high pressure discharge
—the wireless telegraph used the prin-
ciple in the so-called spark transmitter,
and modern engineers found it a very
practical means of igniting fuel in inter-
nal combustion engines.
The instantaneous discharge of electric-
ity mentioned in the previous paragraph
can be generally classified as a spark.
Although it is a rather loose term, it is
commonly applied. Electrical discharges
at high pressures are called high energy
sparks. In the early 1950's extensive re-
search was begun at the University of
Michigan on various methods to attain
very high energy sparks and possible
modes of application for them. Sponsored
by the U.S. Army Office of Ordnance Re-
search, the program is headed by H. C.
Early, research engineer and lecturer in
electrical enginering, and Profssor E. A.
Martin of the electrical engineering de-
partment. They have succeeded in con-
centrating about half the peak current of

a major lightning stroke into a hair-thin
path a half-inch long. The methods of
achieving such a spark are most in-
genious.
Spark Production
In a conventional spark device such as
across the electrodes of an induction coil
or a capacitor charged to high voltage,
only small quantities of energy are avail-
able because the resistance of the air gap
drops to such a point during the dis-
charge that the gap acts as nothing more
than a short circuit. The energy associ-
ated with the discharge, according to
Ohm's law is: P = I-'R, where P is ener-
gy, I is current and R is resistance.
It appears at first that to obtain more
power one must merely increase the cur-
rent. However, instead of the added cur-
rent being turned into a more powerful
spark, more power is simply dissipated
through the circuit wiring. The only other
alternative is to increase the resistance of
the gap. If the resistance of the gap is in-
creased so that a significant amount ol
stored energy is dissipated in a small vol-
ume within a few microseconds, the gas is
heated to an extreme temperature and an
explosive pressure results. When the
spark takes place in the presence of a
liquid, the vapor which is produced
causes additional pressure.
This is one of the methods by which
high energy sparks are achieved. Figure
1 shows a simple electrical circuit which
was used, where the electrodes were im-
mersed in water. The energy for the dis-
charge can be stored in capacitors, in in-
ductors or rotating machinery. As energy
is rapidly transferred to the spark chan-
nel, its temperature and pressure rise. In
contrast to sparks in a fluid medium of
low mass density, such as a gas, the me-
chanical inertia of the water exerts a
nearly rigid opposition to the expansion
of the spark channel. Due to the confin-
ing action, extremely high pressures are
developed.
After the switch is closed, a time in-
terval of several hundred to several thou-
sand microseconds elapses before a gas-
eous channel is formed in the liquid.
During this interval, the current is lim-
ited to a relatively small value deter-
mined by the purity of the water. As
soon as the gaseous path (in a plasma
state) is established through the water,
the current rises to a high value and the
discharge is completed in about 10 addi-
tional microseconds. Pressures on the
order of 10,000 atmospheres can be
achieved by this method.1
Another equally effective means of
producing the high energies is by con-
fining the spark between adjacent paral-
lel dielectric surfaces. Figure 2 illustrates
an experiment to demonstrate the force-
produced by a spark between two such
surfaces. The electrodes of the spark gap
are recessed in small slots in a mycalex
block, as shown in figure 3. A flat bake-
lite plate is placed on top of the block
and a spark is passed between the two
adjacent surfaces. If these surfaces are flat
enough so that the air film between them
is quite thin, i.e. of the order of a thou-
sandth of an inch or less, the spark will
cause the top plate to fly up and hit the
ceiling.2
In this type of experiment, the efficien-
cy with which the stored electrical energy
is converted into kinetic energy is not
particularity high, of the order of 2 or
3 percent. The magnitude of the gas
pressure generated by the spark can be
estimated by means of a simple calculation
which involves the spark duration and the
mechanical work done. The maximum
pressure is of the order of a hundred at-
mospheres. A thin film of oil or water
between the two surfaces substantial!)
increases the pressure generated by a
given amount of stored electrical energy.
Many Uses
The previous descriptions of methods
for producing high energy sparks can
barely serve as an introduction to ths
subject. There are infinite complexities

associated with the phenomenon that can-
not possibly be described in an article of
this nature. Nevertheless, ignoring other
technical aspects, it is interesting to note
some of the uses and interesting effects
of such sparks.
One of the first applications depends
on the very high surface brightness which
is a consequence of the 30,000 degree-
temperature and the high particle density.
As it happens, the radiation from the
underwater spark has a large output in
the ultraviolet, where films and photo-
surfaces have maximum sensitivity. Since
the light output of the spark lasts about
28 microseconds with an intensity about
600 times that of the sun, it is obvious
that, with proper mechanical apparatus,
this would be an excellent device for
high speed photography.
In plasmas encountered in fusion re-
search (see the March, 1961, issue of
the Tec/j&gt;i/c), high energy spark research
becomes useful in studying the passage
of a current through a highly ionized
gas. This is also closely related to the
development of ion propulsion systems
for interplanetary space vehicles.
Recently, oil companies have applied
the high pressures exerted by a spark in
drilling for oil. The electrodes connected
to a capacitor bank are submerged in a
liquid in the drill head. A spark is then
produced within the confined liquid. As
the shock wave expands at a pressure of
10,000 atmospheres or so, it chips away
the rock. It is not difficult to see that this
has an advantage over conventional bits
that must be continually replaced.
One large food company has found
a rather unique use for sparks. In a cer-
tain process, residue that is difficult to
remove collects on mixing paddles. To
solve the problem, underwater sparks
were incorporated utilizing the shock
wave to chip off the residue.
Hypersonic wind tunnels are another
source of employment for sparks. A bank
of capacitors is charged to a very high
voltage and connected across a gap of
high resistance. The gap is situated be-
hind a diaphragm that separates the spark
gap from the wind tunnel. The spark
discharge breaks the diaphragm and cre-
ates a wave that simulates hypersonic
re-entry speeds of aircraft and missiles at
altitudes above 100,000 feet.
Figure 4 illustrates another highly
promising application. In various manu-
facturing processes, it is often required
to make holes of wierd shapes in metals.
Conventional machining methods some-
times make the process very difficult.
High-energy sparks again come to the
rescue. If a die of the required shape is
placed over the metal and the metal sub-
jected to a high energy spark at close
range, the pressure is sufficient to punch
a hole the shape of the die.
A short time ago a large magazine
wanted to insert several pages with holes
punched in them so that they could be
placed in a loose leaf notebook. On pre-
vious occasions, the operations were in-
volved and expensive. First the pages
had to be printed, then cut to size, then
bundled and drilled, untied and rein-
serted. Using high energy sparks, the pro-
cess is now done as the pages come off
the printing press. A tiny die the size of
the hole was placed in position, then a
spark was fired close to the paper. The-
re-suit? A neatly punched hole. But the
advantage of the spark method is that it
can be worked while the paper is moving
20 feet per second.
The previous examples show the ex-
treme practical utility of high energy
sparks, but as Professor Martin points
out, it is more useful as a research tool.
Sparks aid in the research conducted in
many areas such as plasma physics, gas
dynamics, and gas conductivity.

TALKING TO A COMPUTER
Contrary to popular opinion, computers are not
such "super-brains", indeed their intelligence
allows them to recognize only two symbols.
By RICHARD KARPINSKI
"Hi, there, Joe. How are you doing?"
I said as I entered the office.
Not realizing that the question was
merely polite and rhetorical, Joe an-
swered, "Oh, pretty well considering the
neglect I've received in the past 2.487
weeks. There are only two bad tubes
in me noX. Oops, three, and I only use
one of them frequently."
Considering the pie I'd just had for
dessert, I jokingly asked if Joe would
like a piece.
"Pi," said Joe, evincing some confu-
sion, "3.141592653589793 . . . .?"
When I finally got it stopped, Joe-
wanted to know whether the piece I
had offered was rational or irrational
Thus we see a few of the problems
that might still exist if one could speak
to computers vocally, in the English lan-
guage.
However, the problem is not that
simple at the present time, primarily be-
cause computers arc so exceedingly sim-
ple. The English language has some
400,000 words built from twenty-six
letters plus some two dozen special sym-
bols (punctuation marks and numbers
etc.) plus the capitals of all the letters.
Even then, some of the words have up-
wards of forty J/fferent meanings.
A modern high-speed electronic digi-
tal computer can understand only a few
hundred different words, at most, and
these are built from exactly two letters,
which we may call "0" and "1." The
reason for this notation will come later.
Even these few words, all of which are
commands may be broken down into
combinations of the dozen or so simple
things that a computer can actually do.
One of these things that a computer
can do is add two numbers. "Easy as
adding two and two," you say. A com-
puter can't add that high; the best it can
do is one and one, and then the answer

Other commands that it can obey involve
such things as: "put this number there,
i.e. store quotient in location 4357, or
"if the result is positive, obey the com-
mand in location 1775."
"How, then, can computers be faster
than people?" you say. Easy, they can
do perhaps 40,000 of the simple opera-
tions, like multiplying two ten digit
numbers per second. And so, you see

"super-fast super-idiots."
Even then, each of these operations
requires a separate command. And writ-
ing thousands of commands for each
second that the computer was to be in
use, would be no simple chore.
This time there are several solutions
to the problem. One is the sharing plan
for programs, whereby each program
which is developed for a problem that
many people may want to solve is dis-
tributed to the others on a cooperative
basis. Another is called the sub-program
or sub-routine which is a little program
[**J(% *t]/SO
In English: Compute and type out the
logarithm to the base e of the average
of the values X, through XB0. (This is
to be done for one set of fifty numbers,
about which we know nothing.)
Since one cannot compute the log of
a negative number, we need some sort of
a check to see that the result of the aver-
age is positive. In order to make sure we
catch all of these possible goofs, and
just to make the plan fairly clear before

for a little task. Usually, several dozen
of these are readily available for things
like finding a square root or a logarithm
of a number, or pi or the sine of an
angle. This generally means that some
of the difficult parts of the program are
already taken care of.
The third, and by far the most impor-
tant part of the solution, is that one can
put a "loop" into the program. Almost
all of the problems that digital computers
solve, have large parts that are repeti-
tious and must be done over ten or 100
or even 10,000 times, with slightly dif-
ferent data. The essential characteristic
of this is a command which effectively
says, "Now go back and start over again."
Perhaps, this would be the place to
give an example of a fairly simple actual
program. This is one designed for the
Bendix G-15 and incorporates both loops
and sub-routines.
The problem: Compute and type
we start, let us make a "flow diagram"
or general chart of the operations.
Let us consider that the computer has
1,000 storage spaces, numbered from 1
to 1,000, and each of these may hold ei-
ther a command or a number. Also there
is a special place, sometimes several,
where adding, subsracting, and so forth
take place. This we shall call the accu-
mulator.
Now, we shall leave the first hun-
dred spaces for commands and inciden-
tals and load our sets of fifty numbers
into spaces 101 to 150.
Program
Preliminary: load data into 101 to 150.
Load in program.
Load "50" into location Z5.
1. Add the number in 101 into Accu-
mulator.
2. Add one to the location in 1.
3. If the location number in 1 is great-
er than 150 then go on to the com-

If this program were actually run, it
would take less time than it would take
you to say my first name. And you will
notice that the machine operations out-
number the commands by more than 10
to one.
Note that the first three commands
constitute a loop and are performed in
sequence fifty times. The second com-
mand and the first part of the third
guarantee that the computer will even-
tually get out of the loop and go on.
Otherwise, most computers have a little
device to tell them that they're stuck and
will eventually quit. But that is discourag-
ing to the operator.
Also the 4, 5, 6 sequence is a neces-
sary precaution against having the com-
puter try to find the log of zero or a
negative number.
The subroutine in command 9 is stored
somewhere else in the computer and may
be 25 or 30 commands long in itself.
Naturally, the commands wouldn't or-
dinarily be written out as they are above,
but rather in numbers. For humans the
numbers would be the usual decimal vari-

SCIENCE AND MUSIC
The application of modern science has revealed
many interesting facts and unexpected applica-
tions for the universal language.
by BRYAN R. R. WHIPPLE
Editor-in-Chief
Science and music arc two fields that
don't have very much association
with one another in our everyday think-
ing In fact, they seem almost as if oppo-
site poles. Science is considered rigid,
mathematical, and subject to logical
thought and inquiry. Music is custom-
arily thought of in more artistic, aesthetic
ways.
However, these two fields have an
enormous amount in common. In this
article we will examine a few of these
very interesting similarities. First, there
are the scientific attributes of music.
Music is a collection of sounds, and
sound is one of the major topics of phys-
ics. Mechanics is closely connected with
the design of instruments with which
musical sounds are created. Electronics
has become very essential to music lately
for the preservation and reproduction of
musical performances. What is more,
music can be analyzed mathematically,
and significant patterns such as rhythm,
tonality, and thematic development can
be shown to follow more or less rigid
patterns. Finally, these mathematical
characteristics of music are being em-
ployed in conjunction with computing
machines literally to compose musical
works.
Second, there are the musical attributes
of science. Many of the machines and
devices of science produce near-musical
sounds in operation. The sounds of
sports-car racing and of steam locomo-
tives have been recorded and are listened
to by devotees in exactly the same way
that other forms of music are. These
sounds have been used as the basis of
more customary instrumental musical
compositions, as well. An example is
Arthur Honegger's "Pacific 231," a quite
Iistenable orchestral composition based on
the total effect derived from hearing and
watching a steam-propelled passenger
train. Science and music find additional
common ground in the industrial use of
background music as an aid to produc-
tion. Finally, it has been the author's
observation that a very large proportion
of scientifically-minded persons are also
lovers of music. (Perhaps this is a sec-
ondary condition brought about by in-
terest in hi-fi equipment, but I am always
surprised at the large number of techni-
cal and scientific people I recognize in
the audiences at concerts here.)
Physics of Sound
Before we consider music itself, we
should touch briefly upon the subject of
sound, the raw material of music. When
air is set in vibration at any rate within
the audible range (about 40 to 16,000
cycles per second) sound is produced.
We will ignore the philosophical ques-
tions such as whether sound exists if
there is no one to hear, etc. Common
methods for producing sound, a form
of energy, from other forms of energy
are well known. Usually a force is ap-
plied and released upon an elastic body.
Oscillatory distortions begin to pulse
through the disturbed body at a rate
determined by its configuration and con-
dition of stress. These distortions con-
tinue until elastic hysteresis within the
body, or external conditions, absorb the
energy imparted by the disturbing force.
If the body is immersed in a fluid me-
dium such as air, part of the energy will
be transferred to this medium as sound
waves, essentially alternate rarefkations
and compressions of the medium's par-
ticles. These waves move concentrically
outward at a speed determined by the
medium's temperature (most directly)
and obeying the inverse-square law ol
intensity (approximately). These waves
can be reflected in a manner similar to
water waves, causing reverberations and
echoes, and can be focused, causing loud
and dead spots.
Loudness, Pitch, Tone
Loudness, pitch, and tone are three
properties of every sound wave. Loud-
ness obviously refers to the intensity or
amplitude of the wave, and is an index
of the energy content of waves in a giv-
en medium. Pitch refers to the frequency
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the alternating rarefactions and compres-
sions of the medium. Tone is a much
more difficult to define attribute of a
sound wave. In acoustics, tone refers to
the regularity of the sound wave from
the standpoint of loudness and pitch.
The more regular a sound wave is in
these respects, the greater its tonality; a
sound with fluctuating, random loud-
ness and pitch has less tonality. Tone
might be thought of musically as an
index to the degree to which a sound
is removed from being mere noise.
Musical instruments are designed to
have a high degree of tonality in their
sounds. It is this requirement that dic-
tates the peculiar appearances and great
care in the construction of musical in-
struments. Another very important as-
pect of tonality from the musical stand-
point is the producttion of sounds which
are, in frequency, exact multiples of the
basic frequency. It is the relative propor-
tions of these overtones in the sound of
musical instruments that lends the var-
ious instruments their individuality. Over-
tones make it possible to distinguish a
high "C" played on a violin from the
same note as generated by an oboe.
Now let's look at some of the more
common sources of sounds. The organ,
piano, and harp have the widest useful
frequency range. These cover the audio
spectrum from about 16 to 4000 cycles.
In addition, these instruments produce
relatively strong first overtones, which
means that when the highest note on a

Percussion instruments, such as drums,
tend to set up waves in which the pres-
sure differences are the greatest, giving
waves of very high intensity. The funda-
mental frequencies of these instruments
are usually low, but they produce rela-
tively large amounts of very high over-
tones. These are very necessary for sharp-
ness and clarity of sound from the per-
cussion group.

Human Speech as Sound
No discussion of the sources of sound
would be complete without looking at
one of the most useful, wonderful, and
complex sound sources of all, the human
voice. It would be easy indeed to rhap-
sodize at length on the beauty and ap-
peal of which the human voice is cap-
able, but our space is limited and it is
likely that we might confuse the message
content of speech with the sound itself.
In singing, the widest range of fun-
damental frequencies normally achieved,
bass to soprano, is approximately from
64 to 1200 cycles. Of course, many over-
tones are present in singing, and it is
the peculiar mixture of these overtones
used by a given singer in a given passage
that conveys the emotional content of
the song. This quality of the singing
voice is called timbre.
The basic phonetic division of the
sounds of speech is into two classes of
sound-bits, the vowels and the conso-
nants. The number in each group varies
between languages for two reasons. Some
languages are more discriminating about
pronunciation habits, and make very fine
distinctions between similar sounds, giv-
ing the speaker little latitude, while in
other languages, minor variations in pro-
nunciation go unnoticed. Obviously, the
number of sounds separately recognized
is not dependent upon the number of
letters, e.g. the several sounds for which
each English vowel and some consonants
stand at different times. The other rea-

language may be unknown to the speak-
ers of another tongue. Speakers of Eng-
lish have difficulty with the umlaut vow-
els of German. The consonant sound
"th" is common in only a few languages,
including English, Icelandic, and Greek.
Consonants and Vowels
Vowels are the speech sounds which
require the use of the vocal cords. Vowel
sounds can be held for an indefinite-
length of time. Consonant sounds nor-
mally are formed without the use of the
vocal cords, and many of them (the "plo-

This is the portion of the audio spec-
trum which telephone engineers have
found to be most important for the eco-
nomical and accurate transmission of in-
telligence. Extension of this range would
make telephone speech sound more nat-
ural, but is not worth the cost from the
standpoint of intelligibility.
Consonant sounds have basic frequen-
cies covering a larger range—200 up to
an occasional 8000 cps. This is why a
telephonic "s" is little more than a rough
hiss.

ized by the region of the mouth in which
they are mainly formed (labial, alveolar,
dental, etc.), or as to whether they are
voiced or unvoiced (g, z, v, are voiced,
c, s, f are unvoiced).
Vowel sounds are basically pitched in
the lower frequencies—110 to 140 cycles
—but they have so many higher over-
tones that they are still highly intelligible
when the fundamentals are totally sup-
pressed. Telephone equipment, for ex-
ample, is designed to reproduce sounds
in the range from 250 to 2500 cycles.
speech, at least. This is due to the lesser
number of tones in a woman's voice,
which provides fewer stimuli to the au-
ditory membranes. The difficulty is most
pronounced with the more complex
consonants.
The physiological mechanism by which
sound waves are changed into neural im-
pulses in the inner ear is not well un-
derstood. It is assumed that the reader
is familiar with the basic structure of
the ear, with its drum, chain of ossicles,
and fluid-filled canals. A diagram is re-
produced with this article.
While the usual usable auditory range
is about 40 to 16000 cycles, two pheno-
mena in connection with this are impor-
tant. First, ability to hear very high-
pitched sounds is often lost with age.
even though hearing in the normal range
is unimpaired. For example, children can
often hear the high squeal emitted by
TV receivers due to stray coupling be
tween the horizontal-deflection circuits
(15,750 cps.) and the audio section.
Most adults cannot hear this squeal, al-
though it may be responsible for many
of the headaches that televiewers have.
The second phenomenon is the Fletch-
er-Munson pitch sensitivity variation. It
has been shown experimentally that a
sound wave must have higher intensity
in order to have a given apparent loud-
ness to human observers if it is either
higher or lower than the middle ranges.
In fact, the sensitivity curves for the hu-
man ear show a great many points ol
relative maximum or minimum sensitivity
even within the middle ranges.
Randomness and Order
Before tackling the subject of music at
greater length, let us examine the ex-
tremes of randomness and order in sound
The most highly ordered, specific sound
is that of the pure sine wave without
overtones, and of constant amplitude.
Nearly pure sounds are generated by
electronic tone generators alone, and
these must bs carefully designed. The
Naval Observatory radio station, WWV.
broadcasts such tones on 2.5, 5, 10, etc.
megacycles. They broadcast a 440-cycIe
tone for tuning musical instruments
(high A in philharmonic pitch) and I
600-cycle tone for the regulation of 60-
cycle electrical generating stations.
At the opposite extreme is random
noise, the hodgepodge mixture of all
tones, intensities, and durations. This
sounds to the ear like a pure hissing
sound. As with white light, which is all
the colors taken together, the individual
tones are not discernible. For this rea-
son, this is called "white noise." A good
source of white noise is a hum-free hi-
fi set, turned up to full volume with
no input connected. The hissing noise
heard in the speaker is generated by the
random motion of electrons in the com-
ponents, especially the tubes. These ran-
dom currents are amplified as though
they were desired signals, and are deliv-
ered via the speaker.
For purposes of this discussion, we can
now define music. Our definition is not
the broadest one possible, but it is more
all-inclusive than traditional opinions as
to "what is music." Music is a succession

SCUBA DIVING
Many of the basic sciences play critical roles in
governing man's ability to live under water.
by AL MARSHALL
Ten years ago, the word "Aqua-Lung"
was known to a small minority of
people. Today it is not uncommon to
see a group of SCUBA divers invade
any body of water the year around.
Underwater diving is of three types,
skin diving, deep sea diving and SCUBA
diving. Skin diving is by far the oldest
of the three and requires the least equip-
ment. At most, this equipment consists of
a face mask, swim fins and a snorkel
tube. Deep sea diving, on the other hand,
is the most elaborate of the three. This
equipment consists of a spun copper hel-
met and rubberized canvas suit in addi-
tion to an air hose, telephone and hoist-
ing cable to the surface. Fully dressed the
deep sea diver often weighs in excess of
300 pounds. Thus, his mobility below
the surface is greatly limited. SCUBA
diving is the most recent member of the
diving family. This type of diving uti-
lizes portable cylinders of compressed
air as its underwater breathing device.
A compressed air cylinder and regulator
are all that are absolutely essential to
SCUBA diving, but the face mask and
swim fins are almost a necessity for vision
and mobility.
Diving, as such, originated from the
pearl diver. Although he could dive to
great depths, he was dependent on his
lung capacity for the duration of his stay
underwater. The next significant step in
diving was the invention of the deep sea
diving suit by Augustus Siebe in 1837.
It was not until World War II that the
SCUBA or Self Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus method of diving
made its debut. This was the original
"Aqua-Lung" developed and produced
by J. Y. Cousteau and Emile Cognan.
It soon found its way into the U.S. Navy
frogmen units and is now on the public
market.
The technical approach to the sport
of SCUBA diving can be divided into
basically two areas: 1) the mechanics of
SCUBA gear; and 2) the mechanics and
physiology of diving.
Mechanics of SCUBA Gear
The face mask, swim fins and weight
belt give the diver vision, propulsion and
aquatic equilibrium, respectively. The
high pressure air cylinder requires closer
consideration. There are many sizes of
high pressure cylinders in use, but the
most common are the 71.2 cubic foot
tank with a working pressure of 2250
psi. The 71.2 cubic 2 foot tank is
the standard one hour tank used by
most sport divers. The 38 cubic foot
tank is generally used by women or as a
training unit. (Due to the dangerously
high pressures in these cylinders, the
Federal Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion requires that they be tested every
five years at a pressure far above their
rated capacity. A tank of 2250 psi would
be tested at pressures near 4000 psi.)
Air is released from the tank through
a high pressure valve. This is more than
a simple valve, however, since it retains
a constant pressure of reserve air for
the diver. These reserve valves are gen-
rally of two types, the constant air re-
serve and the automatic air reserve. The
constant air reserve is a mechanical valve
which acts as an obstruction in the valve
opening when the pressure falls below
a certain predetermined level. This is
usually 300-500 psi for a single tank.
The diver may release this valve by pull-
ing a lever, thus allowing himself the
extra amount of air to surface. The auto-
matic reserve valve operates on a depth
compensation basis. As the diver goes
to a greater depth a proportional amount
of air is held in reserve. Reserve air will
only be released to the diver as he as-
cends and the pressure of the water
around him decreases. The disadvantage
of this type of reserve is that it will no;
allow the diver to descend after he be-
gins to surface.
The demand regulator reduces the
high pressure of the cylinder to a pres-
sure equal to the hydyrostatic pressure
at a given depth then gives the diver
this pressurized air according to his res-
piratory demands. The amount and pres-
sure of air released is then a function of
the diver's depth and respiration.
Regulators are also of two basic types,
single stage and double stage. The single
stage regulator reduces the cylinder pres-
sure of 1800-2250 psi to a working
breathing pressure then supplies the div-
er with this air in a single operation. The
double stage first lowers the cylinder pres-
sure then feeds it to the diver through a
separate diaphragm system. There are
many variations of the two types of
regulators, but again they fall into either
double or single hose arrangements. In
the double hose version, intake air is
carried through one hose and the ex-
haust air is relieved through the other
and released to the water at the regula-
tor. A simple valve in the mouthpiece
coordinates the intake and exhaust hoses.
In the single hose variety, air is taken in
20

directly into the water through the mouth-
piece. A myriad of other accessories
are also available ranging from depth
gauges and protective rubber suits to
underwater cameras.
Mechanics and Physiology of Diving
Most mechanics and physiological ef-
fects of diving can be traced to three
fundamental gas laws, Boyle's Law, Dal-
ton's Law and Henry's Law. These laws
briefly state that the volume of a gas at a
constant temperature is inversely propor-
tional to the pressure (Boyle's Law),
that the total pressure of several gases
which do not combine chemically is equal
to the sum of the partial pressure of the
gases (Dalton's Law), and that the
weight of a dissolved gas is proportional
to the partial pressure on it (Henry's
Law).
At sea level a person experiences 1
atmosphere of pressure or about 14.7
pounds per square inch on every part
of his body. At 33 feet below the surface
of the water this pressure is doubled and
at 66 feet the pressure is about 45 psi or
3 atmospheres. With these gas laws and
the pressure of the water in operation,
some of the physiological effects on the
diver are unique. Since the regulator
renders air to the diver at the same pres-
sure as the surrounding water, there is no
restriction or difficulty in breathing. Open
sinuses likewise, will fill with compressed
air and the pressure difference will De-
compensated for. If they are congested
by a cold or allergy this pressure cannot
be easily equalized and it is not advis-
able to dive. The ears are another trou-
ble spot for pressure and equalization.
The middle ear is connected to the
throat by means of a canal called the Eus-
tachian Tube, which is designed to act
as a simple valve. This tube is easily
closed by an increase of pressure in the
throat region. Since water pressure is
acting on the exterior eardrum, pain will
be felt when the eardrum is deflected
into the middle ear where the pressure
is lower. This can be corrected by swal-
lowing and equalizing the pressure in
the middle ear. This same phenomenon
is experienced on a fast moving elevator.
There are certain limitations estab-
lished by these gas laws which cannot be
violated. For example the effect of pres-
surizing the body works in reverse when
returning to the surface. Assuming a
diver would not exhale rising from a 33
foot depth, his lungs would burst long
before he reached the surface, since the
volume of air in his lungs would be-
double that at 33 feet. Of course this is
an exaggerated example, but the same
effect results from holding the breath for
even a short period during ascent. This
overexpansion of air in the lungs is
called air embolism, which is sometimes
fatal. A variation of this injury is air
embolism of the tissues, properly titled
subcutaneous emphysema. In the latter
case, it is the air contained in the tissues
not in the bloodstream which overex-
pands. Divers avoid this condition by
controlling their breathing during ascent.
Probably the most notorious of the
divers' ailments is the "bends'' or cias-
son disease. The bends are caused by
gaseous nitrogen which is dissolved in
the bloodstream during the dive then re-
leased upon rapid ascent to a region of
lower pressure. A slow ascent will
allow the nitrogen to escape through the
lungs by normal respiration. This is in
complete agreement with Henry's Law.
Nitrogen bubbles released in the blood-
stream can cause circulation blockage or
local tissue destruction and may ulti-
mately cause permanent paralysis or
death.
"Rapture of the Depths" or nitrogen
narcosis is another phenomenon encoun-
tered by the diver. At a depth of 140
feet or lower, a diver's ability to think
and his coordination become impaired.
It is believed that this is also caused by
nitrogen in the bloodstream which in-
duces a narcotic effect. This is dangerous
only in that it reduces the diver's reflexes
and faculties. It can be avoided by sim-
ply not diving to this depth or using a
special gaseous mixture. This theory is
disputed by Hannes Keller, who recently
made two record SCUBA dives. He says
that there is no such thing as nitrogen
narcosis, but that this feeling is brought
on by a concentration of carbon dioxide
in the blood mixed with oxygen under
high pressure. Recently an oxygen-helium
mixture has been used for deep and
lengthy dives. Helium has been used in
the place of nitrogen due to its inert
chemical properties.
Recent Advancements
Keller, a Swiss mathematician, devised
a different time-depth table for various
mixtures of gases. He used the IBM 650
computer to calculate more than 400 de-
compression tables to depths of 1312
feet. On August 21, 1959, he used the
new tables to make a record dive of 510
feet without pressure equipment. The
dive took only four minutes on the de-
scent and only 30 minutes coming up.
The presently used decompression tables
would require a five to seven hour ascent.
The French Naval authorities became in-
terested in his work and under their su-
pervision he made another record dive
of 820 feet on November 4, I960. The
decompression took only 49 minutes us-
ing his new tables and methods. Nor-
mally this dive would have taken eight
hours for ascent.
SCUBA diving as no other sport, is de-
pendent on physical laws and good
judgement. But like no other sport, it
offers exploration and adventure in a
yet little known part of the world.

Language Machine
Three University of Michigan students
have passed the world's first completely
automated college spoken language-
course with flying colors. All received
"A"s from a professor they never saw
in class.
Taught completely by machine, the
U-M trio learned to speak Spanish like
natives in less than 200 hours. Normally,
this would require at least four semesters
work in traditional method, according to
F. Rand Morton, director of the U-M
Language Laboratory' and designer of the
unique audio-lingual teaching machine.
The machine taught students are: Larry
Smith, a junior, 311 Garfield, Charle-
voix; Adrian Palmer, a senior, 227 Or-
chard Hills Dr., Ann Arbor: and Wil-
liam McNaughton, a senior, 2740 Pack-
ard Rd., ,Ann Arbor.
The U-M student trio are among the
first experimental subjects for a language
development project now under way at
the U-M. Although several students
have tested particular segments of the
automated course, only three have been
exposed to its entirety. In the future
all language learning may be accomp-
lished along similar lines, if future
experimental work is as successful. The
teaching machine is a new concept
in education and most likely will revolu-
tionize education in the next 10 yean.
How does the "automated" course
work?

would. He settles himself in an individ-
ual "learning" booth with his machine
"teacher." He simply dials a number on
a telephone-like control to select his les-
son. Now he"s tuned in to a bank of
continuously playing tape recordings of
specially prepared teaching materials.
The "teacher" presents material in
small easy segments, which the student
learns by repetition. Then the machine
questions the student, making sure each
question is correctly answered before go-
ing on to the next. It allows the student
to teach himself at his own speed.
For example, in learning how to form
the plural in English, the student would
first drill himself on the "s," "z," and
"ez" sounds. The machine would then
teach him through short drills when to
use each sound. Finally, it would make
the correct use of these sounds a "habit."
Once a student has learned a segment in
this way he is unlikely to forget it or
make a mistake.
This, however, puts the three students
at a disadvantage in competing with tra-
ditionally trained third or fourth semes-
ter students. While they can speak and
understand Spanish remarkably well, they
have been trained neither to read nor
to write the language nor to analyze it
with grammatical rules. But reading and
writing the language will be eventually
taught in the same way.
Another student, who took part in the
experimental course learned French in
the traditional method and Spanish with
the teaching machine. He found the ma-
chine considerably easier.
The third student, a senior majoring
in economics, has decided to do gradu-
ate work in linguistics because of the
interest aroused by the course.
Spanish, Russian, and Thai are the
languages now being programmed for
"machine instruction" under the con-
tract. Others will follow after more ex-
perimentation.
New Department
There are at least 500 oceanography
jobs going begging in the United States
—and only a baker's dozen of U.S.
schools to fill them.
The University of Michigan, surround-
ed by the vast water resources of the
Great Lakes, is preparing to launch a
new graduate program in oceanography
next September. The University of Wis-
consin is the only other Midwestern in-
stitution to offer such training.
Marine science has such a need for
trained personnel that "retread" physi-
cists and mathematicians are being
pressed into duty, according to John C.
Ayers (Ph.D.), oceanographer with the
Great Lakes Research Division (GLRD)
of the U-M Institute of Science and
Technology.
Future employment in all aspects of
oceanography is promising, since research
envisioned for the next 10 years will re-
quire twice the existing number of quali-
fied marine scientists. The armed forces
are looking for 90 marine scientists to
work in Washington right now.
One reason for the present shortage
is that until World War II it was almost
impossible to obtain formal training in
oceanography, and nearly all profession-
als entered the field from one or another
of the sciences.
The study of all aspects of waterbod-
ies, the earth of their basins, and the air
above them is a rich field for intellectual
activity which as such is allowed to es-
cape the attention of most students pass-
ing through our universities and colleges.
Oceanographers generally have come
into the field through study of such re-
lated sciences as ecology, meteorology,
geology, hydraulics and, perhaps closest
of all, limnology.
The very recent increased importance
of the seas in national defense, in utili-
zation of marine resources, and in ques-
tions of disposal of radioactive wastes,
has brought home plainly our lack of
adequate understanding of the seas. The
University of Michigan will base its
new graduate program in oceanography
upon the facilities of several depart-
ments. Dr. Ayers is chairman of the
inter-departmental committee.
The U-M program will emphasize gen-
eral scientific training, intensive train-
ing in one of the areas of oceanography,
and at least one semester of marine ex-
perience at an approved coastal oceano-
graphic institution.
The field of research will center upon
obtaining an understanding of the
world's oceans, lakes and streams; and of
the organisms, processes and boundary
conditions operative in salt and fresh
waters, as well as in the sediments and
the atmosphere above.

U-M students learn to speak Spanish like natives in less than 200 hours with this
teaching machine. These students demonstrate the specially constructed
"package programs" which they administer to themselves.

can't understand such advanced things.
So before anything can get into the com-
puter at all, it must be put into binary
form, on paper tape, IBM cards or mag-
netic tape.
Now is the time to explain the (), 1

may invalidate the entire result.
Still, even though talking to a com-

getting correct results requires constant

SCIENCE AND MUSIC

of sounds so constructed as to convey
some emotional or aesthetic sensation to
the hearer, sufficiently ordered to be in-
telligible, and sufficiently random to be
interesting.
From this point we could proceed to
declare that music is customarily intended
to be produced by combinations of some
fifty types of instruments; that it obeys
certain structural rules governing the se-
lection of pitches to be employed simul-
taneously, and so forth. However, musi-
cal experimentalists are currently rolling
back the restrictions in the direction oi
the definition we have given.
Musical Structure
Since most of the world's music was.
and still is, written in obeisance to tra-
ditional rules, we should examine a few
of them. Most are too technical for
lengthy explanation.
When two tones are heard simulta-
neously, the effect can either be pleasant
or unpleasant. The reasons are psycholog-
ical, but are related to physical proper-
ties: the ratio between the pitches of the
tones. Musical scales and systems ot
chords have been developed around com-
binations of tones and pitches which ap-
peal to the ear.
Rhythm is another attribute of music
that can be analyzed scientifically. The
metric patterns of music that are most
enjoyable to the human ear seem to be
those that are similar to the rhythms ot
nature—the gallop of a horse, the beat
of a heart, steps of naturalistic dances.
Composers who have experimented with
highly strange or irregular metric schemes
have not found their work particularly
acceptable to the majority of listeners.
Chords, melody, and their interplay in
musical compositions follow more or less
definite patterns of development: repeti-
tion, echoing, inversion, and so forth.
These are the techniques known as fugue.
counterpoint, inversion, interchange, can-
on, and complement. The reader who is
interested in a more detailed description
of these techniques is referred to (1) in
the bibliography; suffice it to say here
that these are rather specific technique;
used by composers to make their music
more understandable by increasing the
degree of orderliness at the expense of
randomness. The works of early compos-
ers such as J. S. Bach exemplify the ef-

Chemical Engineering
What is it? The American Institute of Chemical Engineers has defined chemical engineering in a con-
cise manner as "the application of the principles of the physical sciences, together with the principles of
economics and human relations, to fields that pertain to processes and process equipment in which matter
is treated to effect a change in state, energy content, or composition." The work of the chemical engineer
encompasses many industries from the manufacture of chemicals, foods, and drugs, and the refining and
processing of petroleum, ores, wood, and plants, to the preparation and extraction of energy from nuclear
fuels, and the chemicals, propellants, and human fuel problems of space technology.
The education of the chemical engineer is based on certain functional operations that are similar re-
gardless of the particular industry or process in which they are employed. Examples of these operations are
the flow of fluids, the transfer of heat, the diffusion and transport of matter, and the reactions of chemical
compounds. For example, in the above photograph a graduate student is determining heat transfer character-

This is just to remind you
that a good knowledge of
miniaturization is worth having
— wherever you go in the
world of engineering.
Keeping engineering minds
well-informed on the latest

to l/lO". They are used in
over 16,000 applications,
ranging from dental
handpieces to missile systems.

SCIENCE AND MUSIC
(Continued from page 26)
feet of strict application of formulistic
techniques such as these. Who can say
that this use of near-mathematical rigor
to certain aspects of the musical art has
lessened the appeal of the product?
Automatic Composition
Since music is, indeed, a mixture of
order and randomness, it can in theory
be devised by computing machines whose
circuits generate random ideas and then
apply certain learned criteria to them. By
programming the machine with instruc-
tions to piece notes together at will, and
then discard the portions which would
be unpleasant, certain rudimentary pieces
of "music" can be composed. By slant-
ing the set of rules given the machine
toward the idiom of a given composer,
his work can be imitated. Of course, the
amount of information the computer
would have to be fed in order to test all
its ideas for acceptibility, and to develop
these themes in a reasonable fashion,
makes the task a very ambitious one.
A group of researchers at the Univer-
sity of Illinois have been experimenting
with computer music for some time.
Their "Illiac" computer has given them a
number of pieces, including the Illiac
suite for string quartet. Listeners who
heard this played (from tape) here at the
U of M recently told me that "parts of
it bordered on being listenable" and
"some of it sounds like regular music."
Apparently the machine is not yet very
proficient nor very consistent. The exper-
imenters claim that they could produce
a i2nd Mozart symphony on their ma-
chine, by feeding in data on all the nat-
ural composer's symphonic work. How-
ever, they admit that it wouldn't bs an
outstanding example of Mozart; just a
very ordinary symphony, rather unin-
spired.
Electronic Instruments
The most immediate use for electron-
ics in the music industry is, however, elec-
tronic instruments (aside from reproduc-
tion, of course). Two such devices are
the theremin and the electronic organ.
The theremin is a small device contain-
ing two oscillators, one fixed-frequency
and the other tunable by moving the
hand above a capacitor plate mounted
atop it. The difference betwween the
two frequencies is a beat-note in the
audible range; it is amplified and brought
through speakers. When a performer
plays his scales on the theremin, he mere-
ly has to raise and lower his hand in the
air above the capacitor plate. The variable
electrostatic coupling does the rest. These
gadgets are used to create the weird sus-
pense music on TV horror programs.
A far more serious electronic instru-
ment is the electric organ. These devices
attempt to reproduce the entire range of
effects available from huge pipe organs at
a fraction of the cost. They contain nu-
merous tone generating circuits, followed
by tone-shaping circuits, designed to em-
phasize various overtones to permit imi-
tative effects corresponding to the stops
on a pipe organ.
Since a loudspeaker is different from
a metal pipe, and a stream of electrons
is not a puff of air, the success has been
limited. However, the organs have be-
come quite popular in small churches
and homes. Special vibrato effects, me-
chanically induced, help the realism.
In order to cover the relation between
science and music completely, we would
have to include a section on the repro-
duction and storage of music. However,
since this is a vast subject, and one about
which many readers already know, I will
mention only that the science of record-
ing and broadcasting has virtually revo-
lutionized music. Once the plaything of
nobles, church choirs, and a few wander-
ing performers, music has stepped into
the everyday life of all. In fact, it is an
annoyance that one cannot escape in pub-
lic places, such as offices, restaurants, and
stores. In this respect, the popularization
of music by science is of dubious benefit.
However, I find it necessary to forgive
technology in this instance—for when
would a man be, could he not drop back
into his easychair at the end of a tough
day, and be enchanted back into beins;
by the art of Bach, the force of Beetho
ven, or the mirth of Shostakovich?

One of the most recent applications
of scientific research, the uce of ultra-
high frequency sound waves is expand-
ing everyday. In her cover, Sherry
Colenso depicts fields in which these
high frequency waves are being used:
in underwater detection, one of the
oldest; and in medicine, one of the
newest. In the last couple of years, ultra-
sonics has been used from the washing
of dishes to the location and treatment
of tumors. In his article, Dave Paul dis-
cusses the phenomenon that makes the
use of these waves possible and the
potentialities of ultrasonics.

The £ditot5 Pen —
A great deal has been written in engineering publications,
both student and professional, about the responsibility of the
engineer in areas not directly related to the technical aspects or
his work. The deluge of propaganda urging the young engineer
to "be diverse" begins in college, with the pressure to take &lt;s
variety of non-technical electives. It continues into his early
working years, with exhortations from all sides to participate in
community affairs, to develop as a well-rounded individual, and
to become more literate, cultured, and urbane.
Speaking strictly for myself, I believe that well-roundednsss
is a very desirable goal. Probably a large majority of engineers
would concur with me. Most of us find our non-technical subjects
interesting, and a relief from the constant procession of labs,
formulas, and slide-rule pushing.
Nonetheless, I know there are many engineering students who
have neither the ability nor the desire to broaden themselves
in this way. Although they will make outstanding engineers, their
inclinations do not tend even in part into the nontechnical.
I defend the right of these men to an education and a job
opportunity where excellence in engineering skills alone is
required. I believe that they ought to be able to earn an engi-
needing degree without the necessity of slogging their way
through countless L S &amp; A courses that leave a lasting impression
only on their grade-point averages. There ought to be an oppor-
tunity for enqineers to take nontech subjects, but I wholly disa-
gree with "The Michigan Daily" and others who would make
them mandatory in wholesale quantities.
I take this attitude because I believe an individual should
have maximum freedom of choice in determining his education,
and hence his life. While perhaps there can be no freedom of
choice as to whether an engineer take strength of materials, the
forced inclusion of humanities in his program is unfair to the man
with no interest in them.
Once again, I will repeat that I think it highly desirable for
the engineer to be liberally educated. 3ut how Lit boys and girls
would howl if statics or circuits were prerequisite to their B.A.!
For the same reasons that Lit students don't take our courses, we
ought not have to take theirs.

SPARK MACHINING
Engineering research has created a new meth-
od to accomplish previously expensive or im-
possible machining operations.
by BENSON SHAPIRO
This machine, the Easco Die Matic
powered by Sparca+ron, has just
completed the 900 pound forg-
ing die lying flat on the work
table. In front of the finished die
are two of the electrodes used in
the process. The die will be used
for forging connecting rods for
crawler tractor engines.
Making a square hole, machining
tungsten carbide, cutting a honey-
comb of steel, are all difficult jobs to
perform using standard machining meth-
ods. A square hole can be broached, but
it is an expensive and slow process. Ma-
chining hard tungsten carbide is almost
impossible because of the tool wear. Cut-
ting a honeycomb is difficult because the
saw deforms the edges of the kerf as it
cuts.
The answer to these and many other
difficult machining jobs is spark discharge
machining, also known as electro form-
ing, spark erosion machining, and elec-
trical disintegration. All of these names
apply to the same basic process, con-
trolled disintegration of metals by high
power electrical discharge.
Equipment
The machinery used in the process is
theoretically simple, but its design pre-
sents many practical problems. The work-
piece is clamped into a tank which is
mounted on a work table which allows
horizontal movement of the tank and the
enclosed work piece. Above the workpiece
the tool electrode is suspended in a chuck
which is free to move in a vertical direc-
tion. The vertical movement is accomp-
lished by a servo-mechanism consisting
of a controlled motor which drives the
chuck by means of a rack and pinion
drive. The pool is filled with a dielectric
fluid, usually a petroleum derived oil.
The electrode and work piece are con-
nected to the power supply which is a
unit designed to convert normal AC line
current into low voltage, low amperage,
rapid firing discharges. The tool acts as
a negative electrode and the workpiece as
a positive electrode. The tool electrode is
held a very short distance from the work-
piece. They are similar to points in a
spark plug, creating a spark gap. When
the charge gets large enough in a capaci-
tor parallel to the tool and work, the
dielectric fluid between the tool and
work breaks down electrically and a spark
jumps from the tool to the workpiece.
The energy of the discharge melts and
vaporizes the metal of both the tool
and the workpiece, but since the work-
piece is the positive electrode, and re-
ceives the charge it erodes faster than
the negative tool electrode.
The eroded metal is carried away by
the dielectric fluid which is circulated
by a pump and reservoir system. The
metal is separated from the fluid by
filters.

WORK
This diagram shows the major parts of the equipment for spark discharge machin-
ing. The major portion of the electrical equipment is used to develop the arc.
The servo controls the movement of the tool.

The rough machining part of the process shown above, accomplishes the major
metal removal. In the next step, fine machining provides the close tolerances
and the finish. The agitation of the fluid is due to its own electrical breakdown
and the vaporization of the workpiece.
10
The shape eroded into the workpiece
is a complement image of the shape of
the tool electrode. If the tool electrode
is a rectangle, the hole formed in the
workpiece is a rectangle.
Design Considerations
The process is therefore very simple;
sending a spark from a tool electrode to
the workpiece. But, there are several cru-
cial considerations. The gap between tool
and work must be kept constant. This is
where the previously mentioned servo-
mechanism enters. As the gap increases.
the voltage of the spark between the
tool and the workpiece decreases because
of the increased energy needed to break
down the larger amount of dielectric. By
means of a delicate feedback system, the
decrease in voltage is relayed to the servo-
mechanism, actuating it. The servo-mech-
anism then brings the tool electrodt
down, thus maintaining a constant gap.
This is a continuous operation.
The current and voltage applied across
the gap must be constant to insure smooth
operation and removal of metal.
The design of the electrode is also of
crucial importance. Since its image is re-
flected in the workpiece, any imperfec-
tions in it will be reproduced. To compli-
cate matters, the tool is constantly erod-
ing, and changing shape. Because of the
field distribution at the tool, wear is
greatest at edges and corners. The tool
must either be designed to compensate
for such wear, or it must be replaced
frequently.
Another problem which occurs rather
frequently in the production of long,
narrow, blind holes is the build up of
large deposits of eroded metal, and other
by-products of the breakdown of the
dielectric. This deposit causes radical
changes in the characteristics of the dis-
charge machining, and hence must be
removed. This is usually done by using
a hollow electrode to bring dielectric
fluid into the area to wash the formations
vay.
Applications
There are many uses for spark dis-
charge machining because of its unusual
advantage over other machining meth-
ods. This advantage is the fact that there
is no physical contact between the tool
and the workpiece. This means that the
process can work any type of metal which
conducts electricity. The ability of a metal
to be eroded is not dependent upon its
physical characteristics such as hardness
and brittleness, but upon its electrical

characteristics. It is fortunate indeed, that
many of the hardest metals such as car-
bide alloys are very well suited to this
method of machining because of their
electrical properties.
Metals can be heat treated before ma-
chining and then machined with no fear
of creating internal stresses which might
weaken the metal.
This elimination of contact between
tool and workpiece also means that deli-
cate pieces of metal such as thin electrical
components and honeycombs can be ma-
chined without bending or crushing.
The specific applications are many and
varied. Size is hardly a problem. I have
seen electric discharge machined parts
ranging from tiny electronic components
to metal stamping dies weighing hun-
dreds of pounds.
Some of the more important applica-
tions include the forming of unusually-
shaped holes formerly done by broach-
ing such as star shaped and square holes.
The making of metal stamping dies and
molds for plastics is another important
application. The fact that by varying the
current density of the discharge, the
finish on the product can be varied means
that highly finished molds and dies can be
made quickly and easily. Another advan-
tage over usual machining methods is
that unusually shaped dies with fillets and
rounds which are difficult to machine are
easily reproduced by electric discharge
machining. This is because it is far easier
to machine the male part of a die which
becomes the tool electrode than the fe-
male part of the die. The male part is
then used as the electrode in machining
the difficult-to-form cavity.
Spark Hardening of Cutting Tools
A most unusual application is that of
coating metals with very hard coatings
such as tungsten carbide. In this process,
the roles of the tool and workpiece are
reversed, and the tool is eroded to a
greater extent. No dielectric fluid is used
in the process. The charge passes from
the workpiece to be coated through an
air gap to the tool electrode which is
made of the hard coating material. Metal
transfer from the tool to the work,
caused by the plasma of the arc, creates
an alloy on the work, which is a combina-
tion of the tool and work piece. This
alloy varies with the type of spark dis-
charge. In most cases a discharge more
like an arc than a spark, creates the
desired hard surface on the work
piece. The tool erodes, and because no
dielectric fluid is present to carry the
erosion away, it is coated onto the work-
piece. This process was developed when
British engineers were trying to improve
the machining process, and observed that
by exaggerating certain conditions, the
coating process became possible.
Spark discharge machining will not
replace the usual machining methods,
but it will supplement them, giving the
engineer yet another method by which
he can work the various metals.

ULTRASONICS
The development of ultra-high frequency sound
has opened a whole new industry.
by DAVID PAUL
One of the fastest-growing industries
in our country today is that of
ultrasonics. Since the use of sonar in
World War II, these high-frequency
sound waves have been fitted to an amaz-
ingly diversified number of tasks. Ultra-
sonic sound is today being used in control
systems of guided missiles; in the clean-
ing of watches, surgical tools, electronic
devices, and other precision instruments;
and in physical therapy to treat joint and
muscle afflictions. These are but a few
of the many ways in which ultrasonics
is being used, and the list is growing
by leaps and bounds.
"Ultra-sound" couples much more
power than audible sound with no dis-
turbing noises. It differs from audible
sound only in that its frequency is high-
er. In most applications of ultrasonics,
the frequency employed is between twen-
ty and forty kilocycles per second, while
the upper limit of human hearing is
approximately eighteen kilocycles per
second; ultrasonic waves arc shorter than
audible wavelengths.
David Paul is currently a soph-
omore in Mechanical Engineering.
A graduate of Detroit's Cooley
High School, his interests include
sports and music. On campus he is
a member of Delta Upsilon social
fraternity. Since his first article in
February of this year, Dave has be-
come an important part of the
Technc article staff, and we hope-
to see his interest continue next
year.

Cavitation
Most present-day commercial applica-
tions of ultrasonics make use of the
liquid medium, or solids in the liquid
phase. High-power devices "irradiate"
the liquid with ultrasonic waves. The
powerful, rapid sound vibrations literally
tear the liquid apart, generating cavities
or bubbles varying in size from micro-
scopic to comparatively large, depending
on the liquid and sound frequency used.
These bubbles may be empty or filled
with vapor expelled from the liquid.
The agitation that produces these cavi-
ties, a "cold boiling" effect, is called
cavitation.
While cavitation is the functional
action in virtually all ultrasonic indus-
trial cleaning and processing equipment,
it is a difficult phenomenon to describe
or explain; scientists have only an ap-
proximate concept of its cause and effect.
Basically, what occurs is the following;
pulsed ultrasonic sound waves rupture
the liquid at a periodic rate. During half
of the excitation cycle—the tension phase
—the local pressures are less than the
vapor pressure of the liquid and millions
of cavities are formed. These bubbles
possess a considerable amount of stored
energy. On the following half-cycle, the

the vapor pressure, and instantaneously
collapses these bubbles by compressing
them. As a result, the bubbles release
tremendous localized forces as they
collapse.
Explosions Blast Dirt Away
As they explode, these collapsing
globules can actually "blast" away dirt
and almost any other foreign substance
from any object immersed in the liquid.
As the pressure is increased, the liquid
is forced into the pores, crevices, and
previously inaccessible parts of the object;
during the following pressure decrease,
the liquid erupts violently from the ob-
ject, carrying bits of surface material
with it. In some cases, depending on the
material and length of exposure, the
surface of the object may be literally
eroded away.
Cavitation also affects the liquid itself.
As a result, it is used to de-gas fluids,
homogenize, emulsify, and perform other
processes that were formerly difficult, ex-
pensive, or impossible.
Equipment
In order to generate these sound waves,
a source of power is needed for the
transducer, a device that converts mechan-
ical, electrical, or hydraulic energy into
ultrasonic waves. Usually, the generator
employs an electric oscillator as the
power source. Such a pulsed generator
assures complete cavitation within the
tank since it allows any barrier of air
bubbles that may have formed between
the object to be cavitated and the trans-
ducer to die out before another burst of
sound is sent through the tank. In this
manner, the reduction of uniform and
complete cavitation of the liquid is avoid-
ed. The power output used may vary from
fifty watts average and 200 watts peak in
small, portable units to two kilowatts
average and eight kilowatts peak in large
capacity equipment.
The transducer is connected to the
generator by a cable and is either attached
to the bottom or sides of the cleaning
tank or immersed in the tank fluid. In
many cases, one or more tanks, combined
with single or multiple transducers, may
be operated off of one generator.
The cleaning tanks used may vary
greatly in size and shape. Present ultra-
sonic cleaning and liquid processing
equipment use "tanks" ranging in size
from small beakers to 150 gallon tanks.
In the assemblies used to clean the long,
slender "Atlas" guided missile, a forty-

ray tube screen. Blocks of metal (left) designed with planned defects enable

two foot-long tank with 100 transducers
along the tank bottom is used!
The liquid used in the cleaning tanks
may be either plain water or water with
detergents or an appropriate solvent
added. This is another advantage of ul-
trasonic cleaning—water solutions are
frequently used in cleaning operations
which previously required highly toxic
solvents dangerous to the material being
cleaned and to the operator of the clean-
ing process.
Two Major Types of Transducers
Essentially, two different types of trans-
ducers are used in practice. One of these
is called the piezoelectric crystal trans-
ducer. The crystal transducer utilizes
slabs of ceramic-type materials such as
quartz, Rochelle salt, or barium titanate
that are commonly used in phonograph
and microphone cartridges. A high-fre-
quency alternating current is impressed
across these slabs, which expand and con-
tract, respectively, as they accumulate
and release charge, setting up ultrasonic
vibrations. The frequency used is usually
very nearly equal to the natural resonant
frequency of the crystals, since it is at
this point that the amplitude of the crys-
tals' vibrations is greatest. These piezo-
electric materials may also be cast into
shapes other than slabs, such as parabolic
bowls and cylinders, that are suited to
focusing energy within a small area so
that more intense cavitation can be de-
veloped for localized cleaning and liquid
processing.
The second widely-used transducer,
called a magnetostrictive transducer,
makes use of a ferromagnetic material
such as a nickel alloy. The material is
placed in an oscillating magnetic field
so that its expansions and contractions
set up ultrasonic vibrations. Again, the
current used is at the natural resonant
frequency of the material so that maxi-
mum amplitude is obtained.
The ferromagnetic material is usually
fashioned into thin rubes, rods, or lami-
nated stacks resembling a deck of cards
and then used as a core for the driving
coil through which the current is passed.
This construction minimizes power losses
to hysteresis and eddy currents. In com-
parison, the crystal transducer is more
efficient, but it is also fragile and unable
to handle great amounts of power. Con-
sequently, it is used whenever the situa-
tion demands high frequency and low
power.
The magnestostrictive devices are stur-
dier and can operate at lower frequencies
than the crystal transducers; they can
also handle almost any amount of power.
However, they are temperature-sensitive,
since the magnetostrictive effect decreases
as the temperature increases and disap-
pears at the Curie point where magnetic
processes cease to exist.
Applications and Uses
The scope of operations that ultrason-
ics will perform seems almost unlimited.
Since the use of sonar by the military in
World War II, this amazing industry has
grown by leaps and bounds to a point
where today it does an annual business of
over $40,000,000, although it is still a

GAS SOLUBILITY
IN METALS
Experimental data have revealed many impor-
tant facts concerning the influence of dissolved
gases on the properties of metals.
by GERALD N. GOLDBERG
As technical knowledge in the field
of metallurgy and its associated
areas increases, the effects of a dissolved
gas in metals and alloys is becoming bet-
ter understood. For the most part, the
gases of major concern are the diatomic
gases, i.e. hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen.
In some cases, dissolved gases prove to
be beneficial and are an integral part of
the quality of the desired product. How-
ever, in the majority of cases, these gases
produce only adverse effects which are
deleterious to product quality.
The Problem
The effects of dissolved gases can be
shown by considering the following ex-
amples. In the casting industry, gas
solubility may tend to cause gas porosity
upon solidification of the metal due to
the change in the solubility of a specific
gas with respect to temperature. Nitro-

gen dissolved in low carbon steel his
effects upon elongation, deep drawing,
and machinability while in some stain-
less steels, it may act as an austenitc
stabilizer. Often the dissolved nitrogen
may combine with other dissolved gases
which may be present and cause exten-
sive gas porosity.
The presence of dissolved oxygen, as
with the other diatomic gases, often re-
sults in a highly strained lattice structure
in the resultant metal. This may be
attributed to the fact that the atoms of
the gas are so small that they dissolve
interstitially in the metal lattice, produc-
ing a highly strained structure upon
cooling. Interstitially dissolved hydrogen
may also produce a strained lattice which
causes hydrogen embrittlement of the
metal.
Therefore, due to the fact that product
quality is of the utmost importance to
the consumer, a great deal of research in
this area is continually being done so
that the manufacturer will be capable of
supplying a product which can suitably
meet the ever-increasing needs of science
and industry. Through this research, it
is hoped that effective ways of controlling

learned.
Experimental Considerations
In studying the solubility of gases in
the various liquid metals and alloys, a
great many factors must be taken into
account. At the high temperatures in-
volved in such a study, there is a possi-
bility of interaction between refractories,
slag, gas phases, or metal phases. There-
fore, one must exercise extreme precau-
tion in selecting materials lest contamina-
tion and subsequent error result due to
the fact that the materials may not re-
main inert with respect to one another.
However, depending upon the system
being investigated, there exists a variety
of choices of materials which may be
used without introducing errors into the
measurements. Such materials as alumina,
quartz, magnesium oxide, and vycor
(fused silica) are only a few which may
be used with reasonable accuracy.
The most widely used method for
determining gas solubility is that first
developed in 1910 by A. Sieverts. In
this determination, he admitted a known
volume of gas into an evacuated vessel,,
or "reaction chamber" which contained
the metal. Once a constant pressure was
attained, the amount of gas dissolved was
measured as the amount of gas initially
introduced to the system minus the vol-
ume required to fill the empty space in
the chamber. This volume of empty
space, or "voil", is usually referred to
as "hot volume". The early studies in
this field indicated that Sieverts' Law
given by the equation % N = K\/PN2
was quite accurate for diatomic gases dis-
solving in liquid metal.
For repetition of these solubility deter-
minations, several definite special tech-
niques must be considered. The reaction
chamber should be completely vacuum
tight and of as small a volume as pos-
sible in the interest of accurate measure-
ments. These chambers should be made
of a material such as Vycor glass or other
high temperature, non-reactive material
to keep accuracy at a maximum and
equipment failure at a minimum. Usually,
the use of an ordinary mercury mano-
meter is sufficient for pressure measure-
ments. However, when a McLeod gauge-
is used, it must be carefully calibrated
to give accurate measurements. In order
to determine the "hot volume" of the
reaction chamber, measurements must be
taken using an inert gas with the metal
sample in place at each temperature to
be studied.

materials is of the utmost importance.
Not only are there adverse effects caused
by the presence of impurities in the
metal but also from the presence of an
unsuspected gas. Correct and useful re-
sults may only be obtained if the purity
of both the metal and the gas is high and
there is no chance for contamination.
Experimental Procedures
As in most research programs, there-
are, of course, cjuite a number of pro-
cedures for obtaining the desired re-
sults. Some of these methods are better
than others but, overall, the Sieverts'
method seems to be the most satisfactory.
However, a few of these alternate meth-
ods will be mentioned briefly in order
to provide a more complete view of the
problems of experimentally measuring
gas solubility.
One method consists of exposing the
metal sample- to the gas for a long period
of time. The metal is allowed to solidify
and then its gas composition is checked
by means of chemical analysis. However,
a problem encountered here is that if the
liquid metal becomes saturated with the-
gas, there will be, upon solidification of
the metal, gas evolution and consequently
an inaccurate presentation of the actual
solubility of the gas in the metal. One-
way to avoid this problem has been to
use a gas which has a low partial pres-
sure and will therefore remain in the
metal provided solidification is rapid.
Methods have been derived by which
solubilities can be measured at very high
pressures and also at very low pressures.
Gases which have very low solubilities
must be used at pressures which are
quite high in order to magnify their
solubility to the point where measure-
ments may be considered accurate. On
the other hand, there- is some experimen-
tation which is limited to very low press-
ures. For example, the solubility of
oxygen in liquid iron may be investi-
gated at pressures of 10 ■" to 10 8 at-
mospheres by using mixtures of H.O
and H2 or C02 and CO to provide con-
trolled oxygen pressures.
At the present time, the Siverts' meth-
od is being used in the Department of
Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
to determine the- solubilities of hydrogen
and nitrogen in liquid iron and iron
alloys. This work is being carried out
with the support of the Rackham Re-
search Fund under the direction of Pro-
fessor R. D. Pehlke.
The Sieverts' apparatus used in these
solubility determinations and its asso-
ciated reaction chamber is shown in
Figures I and II. One of the gas supply
tanks shown in Figure I holds the gas
being investigated and the- other holds
an inert gas such as argon used for flush-
ing and also for calibrating the system.
The drying towers and the- oxidizing
furnaces are used in the purification of
these inlet gases. Stopcock f4 permits us
to introduce either of these gases into
the system depending upon the- positions
of stopcocks (.., f„ and fr. When (- and
f, are open, the gas is admitted to the
gas measuring burette, g, only. Upon
opening f2, the gas is also admitted to
the mercury manometer, j, and the reac-
tion chamber k.

Nitrogen dissolved in pure iron at

By adjusting the various stopcocks, in
particular the position of f„ any desired
part of the system may be evacuated. In
order to evacuate the reaction chamber,
manometer, and burette, f, must be- ad-
justed to pumping position, f2 and f;
must be opened and f"4 must be- complet-
ly closed. To pump out the- back part of
the system, f, must be adjusted to the
proper position, I- must be closed and f,&gt;
should be- opened. In this way, the back
part of the system will be evacuated in-
cluding the space above the* mercury level
in the bulb, j. Another feature* of this
apparatus is that the burette, manometer
and reaction chamber may be evacuated
from the back by simply opening (-, f (,
and {.,, while completely closing (t.
Finally, the system may be returned to
atmospheric pressure by the- use of f6,
which in one position is open to the
atmosphere. By successively openm-;
this and other stopcocks, air is easily ad-
mitted into the system and the- vacuum
may be slowly released.
As shown in Figure I, the entire reac-
tion chamber is water-cooled since we
are working with temperatures of the
order of 1600°C. When working at a
highly reduced pressure even the temper-
ature resistant Vycor glass may be seri-
ously damaged if it is not cooled.
Temperature- measurements are made
using optical pyrometer calibrated against
the melting point of pure iron. These
measurements are made through the
right angle prism, c, and the quartz
sight glass shown in Figure- I. In thi&gt;
way, the pyrometer is focused through
the hole in the crucible cover directly
on to the liquid iron. Care must be taken
to keep the pyrometer lens, quartz sight-
glass and the* prism quite clean since any
dirt present can result in inaccurate tem-
perature measurements. By substitutin-;
a small resistance furnace or similar unit
for the induction coil, solubilities of gases
in lower melting metals, such as alumi-
num and lead, can easily be obtained
using the same method as previously-
described.
Conclusions
By now, it should be evident to the
reader that a knowledge of gas solubili-
ties are of the utmost importance- to the
manufacturer if the desired product is
to be- obtained. It is, therefore, the job of
the research scientist to uncover and
make more widely known this informa-
tion so that others may benefit by it. It
has been shown that dissolved gases in
liquid metals can be either helpful or
harmful, depending on their effect upon
the product concerned. It is for this
reason that a good knowledge of the
effects of dissolved gases must be devel-
oped if today's materials are to meet the
ever-rising standards which are required
of them.

THIS YOUNG ENGINEER
IS ON THE ROAD TO MANAGEMENT
Dick Cotton knew he wanted to take the
engineering route into management long before
he joined New Jersey Bell Telephone Company.
In fact it was his goal when he was working for
his engineering degree at Rutgers.
When he graduated, he had his lines out to
eleven other companies. He came to New Jersey
Bell because: "I didn't feel I was just a number
to these people. There was no doubt in my mind
that this job would be the best for the long pull."
His first assignment was a tough one. A com-
plex of major telephone cables lay in the path of
the approach to the new traffic level of the George
Washington Bridge on the Hudson. Dick's job
was to find the most practical and economical
way to reroute these cables, and at the same time
to provide for future telephone growth in the
area around the bridge approach.
Dick ironed that one out and got a crack at
another tough job.
Next stop: New Jersey Bell Headquarters
Engineering Staff, Special Studies Group. Here
Dick was a member of a four-man team whose
job was to find ways to eliminate some of the
routine work of field engineers to give them
"more time to think." Dick also helped plan
and control a $100,000,000 annual telephone con-
struction budget.
Presently, Dick is responsible for telephone
equipment engineering projects in the Camden,
New Jersey, area.
How does Dick look at it? "This is a growing
business. I work with this growth every day.
And growth means more room at the top. Of
course, I don't figure I'll get there overnight—
but on my jobs so far I've had a chance to take
a good look at how this business is run. And I
think the sky's the limit for a man who really
wants to work for it."

deliver the goods—then you're the kind of man who
should find out more about the Bell Companies.

Ever mindful of its obligation to
present and future generations, the
staff of the University of Michigan
strives to offer its best contributions to
the information agencies of the world.
This month's M.E. &amp; R., presents a note
of the contributions made to the Encyclo-
pedia Britannica by 12 University Pro-
fessors. Also included is the development
of an amazing war machine.
Spark Lab
One of the world's most advanced en-
gineering laboratories is being created
by The University of Michigan College
of Engineering.
When it is ready for operation in Sep-
tember, U-M engineers will use their
new laboratory for advanced instruction
and frontier research in three areas: space
flight phenomena, high energy storage
and transfer, and thermonuclear energy.
For these purposes, three college depart-
ments—aeronautical and astronautical en-
gineering, electrical engineering, and
nuclear engineering—will share the new
laboratory.
All of these uses require one thing in
The power unit for the University of Michigan's new magneto-fluid dynamics lab.
The unusual "unipolar" generator in the foreground takes current from standard
power lines and stores it as energy in its flywheel in the huge coil in the background.

common: a device to provide great
amounts of electrical energy (equivalent
at peak pulse power to between one and
two million kilowatts—about the normal
load of the entire Detroit Edison Com-
pany). Such a device is the heart of the
laboratory. Devised by a U-M engineer,
it consists of an unusual unipolar gener-
ator and a huge coil, some five feet thick,
20 feet in diameter, and wound with i
cable as thick as the stout end of a base-
ball bat.
U-M astronautical engineers will put
this immense wallop of energy to work
in a hypersonic (over five times the speed
of sound) wind tunnel for research on
re-entry and associate conditions. They
want to learn more about what happens
to space vehicles re-entering the atmos-
phere, and to the chemical composition
of air heated by the passage of such a
vehicle.
The astronautical engineer will dump
the big spark (about 350,000 amperes)
into an arc chamber, where it will instan-
taneously heat a gas (such as air) to
around 20,000 degrees (Fahrenheit)—
about twice the temperature of the sun's
surface. This hot gas will then expand,
rupture a metal diaphragm, and blast
through a tiny nozzle and past a model
in a test section into a vacuum tank. The

:imum speed of gas past a model in
test chamber will be about 20 times
speed of sound (or about 15,000
miles per hour), creating conditions sim-
ilar to those of re-entry of space vehicles
in the earth's atmosphere. These condi-
tions will allow about 20-thousandths of
a second for the research measurements.
Electrical engineers will have the op-
portunity to study electromagnetic wave
reflection and absorption by ionized gases
to better understand communication tech-
nology. They will also use the laboratory
to study the properties of electric arcs
at high currents and pressures. (Pressure
as high as 5,000 times the earth's atmos-
pheric pressure will be produced in the
arc chambers.) They are interested too,
in learning how to reduce electrode ero-
sion. Such high energy arcs eat away the
surface of the electrodes, vaporizing the
carbon or metal of which they are made.
The U-M engineers hope to be able to
find a way to move the arc discharge
point over the electrode to keep it from
eroding one spot.
Nuclear engineers will study processes
and conditions leading to controlled fu-
sion reactions ("harnessed H-bomb
power") in the new facility. Sustained
thermonuclear! reactions (which have
been approached but not attained in at
least one U.S. laboratory) require temper-
atures of around a hundred million de-
grees. Gases this hot are ionized (or
stripped of positive or negative particles
and enabled to carry electric current) and
are contained in a strong magnetic field.
A high energy source, such as the
laboratory will provide, is necessary to
yield both the high temperatures and
strong magnetic fields required to ap-
proach sustained thermonuclear reactions.
Experimental work by the U-M nuclear
engineers will focus on understanding
hot gases in a magnetic field, developing
measuring techniques, and making meas-
urements of these conditions.
Called the "'Magneto-Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory," the facility is being installed
in space adjacent to the U-M's propul-
sion laboratory on the University's North
Campus.

"baby" in terms of the many uses pre-
dicted for ultrasonics that have not yet
been perfected.
As mentioned already, cavitation affects
liquids in many ways. It will de-gas
fluids and it already has several uses in
connection with this property. Sound
waves are now being beamed through
beer bottles before capping, causing the
beer to foam and forcing out trapped air,
thereby lengthening the shelf life of the
beer. It is also used in the wine indus-
try to speed up the aging process. Cavi-
tation even cleans, degreascs and decon-
taminates radioactive materials from in-
struments' most inaccessible positions. It
cleans everything from electronic appara-
tus to surgical instruments, camera lenses
to giant missile assemblies. The need to
disassemble complicated devices before
cleaning is also done away with by ultra-
sonics and, despite its great power, cavi-
tation will not harm glass, chrome-plate,
stainless steel, or etched and painted
markings.
"Ultrasound" is used in industry to
clean motor and generator armatures,
vacuum tubes, printed circuits, electric
meters, potentiometers, and transistors.
It also removes excess solder flux, etching
resists, fingerprints, polishing compounds,
lint, wax, and other soils from virtually
all kinds of items.
In the metal-working industry, ultra-
sonic waves are used not only to clean
but also to drill holes in hard, brittle ma-
terials like tungsten carbide, steel, brass,
and even glass because the drill operates
by making an up-and-down movement
rather than by rotating. Fluid in the form
of an abrasive slurry, activated by ultra-
sonic energy, literally eats away any ma-
terial—the harder the better. The hole
made is the exact shape of the bit used,
which may be square or any other odd
shape. The bit doesn't have to be hard
either. Driven by ultrasonic, a fork can
cut holes in glass and a penknife can
slice tool steel!
Ultrasonic is also used as a tool of in-
spection in the railroad, aircraft, and
metals industries since it can "see" in-
side materials. When a crack or other
defect hidden from sight is "seen" by
the sound wave, part of the wave is re-
flected back to a measuring instrument.
The other part of the wave travels to the
opposite end of the material and is also
reflected back. By comparing the elapsed
time with a standard, the exact location
of the flaw can be determined. Tires are
currently being tested and inspected in
this manner.
Military uses for ultrasonic include
control systems for missiles, depth sound-
ers, and systems for underwater search
and communication. Extensive use of ul-
trasonic in the medical field is just begin-
ning but great progress has already been
made in this area. Surgical instrument-.
formerly thrown away after one using are
now being cleaned and recleaned by ultra-
sonics. Physicians are using these waves
in physical therapy to heat deep tissue
much as in diathermy, to locate and
destroy tumors in previously inaccessible
places, and also to purify and emulsify
drugs. They are also using ultrasonics in
much the same way as X-rays, receiving
a picture on a TV-like screen. The chief
advantage of this method is that soft
organs such as the heart and lungh show
up better.
The Future
A bright future looms ahead for the
ultrasonics industry. The next few years
should see the perfection of such ultra-
sonic devices as a home solderer, an air
cleaner that traps dust before it settles
on furniture, a clothes washer, and even
a sonic bathtub that imparts a pleasant,
tickling sensation. Prototypes of all these
items are realities even now; the only
obstacle to their being placed on the
market is their prohibitive price. For ex-
ample, a home solderer can now be
bought for about $200 and a hospital
instrument cleaner presently costs about
$3000. Leaders in the ultrasonics indus-
try feel confident of their ability to low-
er these prices and predict a great future
for this comparative new field. Indeed,
these unseen, unheard ultrasonic waves
have already performed previously im-
possible tasks quite competently and there
seems to be no end to the number of ways
in which this fascinating phenomenon
can amaze us.

At a party a doctor was complaining
about all the women who approached him
on these occasions. "You know," he said
to the man sitting beside him, "they al-
ways want advice. They tell me about
their ailments, and they ask me to pre-
scribe for them. That's why I hate to go
to these parties. You're a lawyer," he con-
tinued, "do you think I should charge
them for this advice even if I give it after
office hours?"
"By all means," said the lawyer. "Ad-
vice is advice."
Next day the doctor received a letter
from the lawyer.
The bill read simply: "For advice—
$50."
The other night I phoned a girl named
Doris. "Doris isn't here right now," a
voice answered. "But this is her young,
112-pound, 5-foot-4, blue-eyed, red-
haired sister."
The day after finals a disheveled M.E.
walked into a psychiatrist's office, tore
open a cigarette, and stuffed the tobacco
up his nose.
"I see you need some help," said the
startled doctor.
"Yeah," agreed the M.E., "Got a
match?"

The first American astronaut to land
on Mars cautiously emerged from his
rocket ship. He looked around and saw
coming towards him a beautiful babe.
She was the most wonderful hunk of
woman he'd ever seen. Only she was 11
feet tall. He waited until she came dose.
Then he said quickly: "Take me to your
ladder. I'll see your leader later."

A young druggist was left in charge
of the store while the owner went for a
cup of coffee. When he returned he in-
quired how the young man had made
out.
"Oh, just dandy—I cured a lady's
cough."
"What did you give her?"
"Well, I gave her a malted milk with
four ounces of mineral oil and five
ounces of castor oil in it."
"My God, that won't cure a cough!"
"Yeah? Just look at who's leaning on
that lamppost across the street. She
doesn't dare cough!"
A new patient had been on the psy-
chiatrist's couch for five minutes. When
the doctor asked him to repeat a state-
ment, the patient looked up and irritably
snapped, "I said, Doc, that for some un-
known reason people don't like me . . .
Open your ears, pinhead."
A young man walked into the circus
arena as they were setting up their tents
for the opening performance and ap-
proached the manager.
"Sir," he began, "I'd like to apply for
a job in your circus. I've got a very dar-
ing and unusual act."
The manager asked the young man
what he did.
"I climb to the top of your circus
center pole," he explained, "and dive
head-first into a bucket of sand."
The circus manager was flabbergasted.
"Nobody can do that," he said. "Show
me."
The young man climbed to the top of
the center pole and dived head-first into
a bucket of sand. The circus manager
was amazed.
"That's tremendous, kid, positively
amazing. You're on the payroll as of
this minute, right now. Two hundred
bucks a week."
"No, no," the young man said.
"Okay," the manager pressed. "I'll
double that figure and give you a two-
year contract."
The young man still refused.
"Okay, okay, kid. You're a good bar-
gainer. I'll give you $2,500 a week and
make it a 10-year contract. That's the
biggest salary I've ever paid anyone. But
you're worth it. You'll bring 'em in."
The young man just shook his head
negatively. "For Pete's sake. Why not?"
pleaded the owner.
The young man, rubbing his neck,
answered: "I just don't think I want to
do that trick any more."
Sam was standing on a street corner
when he saw his buddy, Joe, come driv-
ing up in a brand new car. Sam said.
"Say, Joe, where did you get that new
car?"
"Well, it's like this. I was standing
on this very corner when a beautiful girl
drives by in this car. She asked me if I
wanted to ride and you know I don't turn
it down. Well she drives out to this lone-
ly spot and takes off all her clothes and
says 'Joe, you can have anything you
want,' So I took this car."
"You know you were right, those
clothes wouldn't have fit you anyway."
Probably the reason that God made
woman last was that he didn't want any
advice while creating man.

Hungary. The characters: A Russian offi-
cer, a Hungarian, an old lady, and an
attractive girl.
The train enters a tunnel. The passen-
gers hear first a kiss, then a vigorous
slap.
The old lady thinks: "What a good
girl she is, such good manners, such fine
moral character!"
The girl thinks: "Isn't it odd that the
Russian tried to kiss the old lady and
not me?"
The Russian thinks: "That Hungarian
is a smart fellow; he steals a kiss and I
get slapped."
The Hungarian thinks: "Am I a
smart fellow! I kiss the back of my
hand, hit a Russian officer and get away
with it."

The preacher was expounding on his
subject: "Who has the most money to
spend?" He cried, "Who has the big-
gest car? . . . the saloon keeper! Who has
the finest fur coat? . . . The saloon keep-
er's wife! And who pays for all this? . . .
You do, my friends, you do!"
Several days later a man and his wife
who had been in the audience stopped
the preacher on the street and thanked
him for the good advice they received
from the sermon.
"I'm glad indeed that you've given
up drink," said the preacher.
"Well, it isn't that," ventured the
man, "we bought ourselves a saloon."

A man who moved into a well-to-do
but stuffy neighborhood was mowing his
lawn one hot day with his shirt off. After
several minutes had passed a patrol car
pulled over to the curb and the cop
walked over to the man.
"Don't you know you're breaking the
law?" growled the cop. "We don't allow
indecent exposure in this neighborhood."
The man, convinced he was acting per-
fectly innocently, shrugged his shoulders
which exasperated the cop.
"Why, what would people say if your
wife mowed the lawn dressed like that?"
"They'd say I married her for her
money," the man replied.

A man sat at the bar rail all night and
when he was ready to leave crawled up
the wall, across the ceiling, down the
wall and out the door. One patron asked
the bartender, "Isn't that fellow a pretty
strange individual?" "Yeah," said the
bartender, "he never says goodnight."
A college student arrived at the Pearly
Gates where St. Peter asked him who he
was. When told he was a pre-med, St.
Peter said, "Go to the Devil."
Some time later a pre-law student
arrived, and upon being asked who he
was, replied that he was a pre-law
student. He was told to go to Hades.
The third student arrived at the Pearly
Gates with his slide rule. When asked
who he was he replied, "I'm an en-
gineer."
Whereupon St. Peter said "Come on
in, son. You've been through Hell al-
ready."

Once upon a time there were three
bears. One morning they came down to
breakfast and Papa Bear looked at his
bowl and cried, "Someone's eaten all
my porridge."
Baby Bear looked at his bowl and
cried, "Someone's eaten all my porridge."
"Sit down and shut up," said Mama
Bear. "It ain't poured yet."
A young Arkansas lass was milking
her cow when down the road a piece she
saw a young man approaching. She called
to her father, "Oh, Father, there is a
boy coming up the road." Her father re-
torted with, "Get in the house." She
called back, "But he looks like one of
those engineers." "Then take the cow
in, too." answered the old gentleman.
Is this a picture of your fiance?"
"Yes."
"She must be wealthy."
* * *
She: "Have you heard about the new
college game?"
He: "No, what is it?"
She: "Button, button, here comes the
housemother."
The waitress was wondering why the
elder man was eating while his wife was
staring out the window.
"Aren't you hungry?" asked the wait-
ress.
"Sure am," was the reply, "I'm just
waiting till Paw gets through with the
teeth."
And there was the heart rending case
of the man who spilt a whole bottle of
hair restorer on his head and smothered
before he could get to a pair of scissors.
A sort of old-fashioned gentleman
took his gal for a ride in his car and
after finding a suitable spot to park,
kissed her several times lightly on the
cheek and then said, "This is called
spooning."
"Okay," she said, "but I had much
rather shovel."
Two Ag. engineers each had a horse,
but they couldn't decide which belonged
to whom. So they cut the mane off one
to differentiate, but it soon grew back.
Next they cut the tail off one, but that
also grew back. Finally they measured
them and found that the black one was
four inches taller than the white.

"Did you follow my advice about kiss-
ing your girl when she least expected
it?"
"Oh, Heck," said the fellow with the
swollen eye, "I though you said Where."

"If it's heads, we hit the sack. If it's
tails, we stay up. If it stands on edge, we
study."

Engineers are continually surprised to

me a better man."
Co-ed: "Why try to get to heaven in

As he felt his way around the lamp
post, the overloaded senior muttered,
"S'no use, I'm walled in."

Mrs. Worthmore and her French
poodle were shopping one day, when she
noticed the man standing next to her at
the counter was looking fearfully at the
puppy frisking about his legs.
"My, my," she said, "don't be afraid
of Felix, he won't bite you."
"Madam," said the man, "I wasn't
afraid he'd bite, but I noticed him lift-

research and development-

-you'll find
Photography
at Work
with you
Research and development engineers
find photography one of their most
versatile tools. Camera and film can
record the readings of instruments—
can capture for study the fleeting
transient on the oscilloscope face. The
content and structure of metals can be
studied by photospectrography or
x-ray diffraction. And stresses in parts
are visualized by photographing
plastic models with transmitted polar-
ized light.
There's hardly a field on which you
can set your sights where photography
does not play a part in simplifying
work and routine. It saves time and
costs in research, on the production
line, in the engineering and sales
departments, in the office.
So in whatever you plan to do, take
full advantage of all the ways photog-
raphy can help.
CAREERS WITH KODAK:
With photography and photographic proc-
esses becoming increasingly important in
the business and industry of tomorrow,
there are new and challenging opportunities
at Kodak in research, engineering, elec-
tronics, design, sales, and production.
If you are looking for such an interesting
opportunity, write for information about
careers with Kodak. Address: Business and

One of a series
Interview with General Electric's
Francis J. Boucher
Manager-Manufacturing Personnel Development Service
How Good
Is Your Best Job Offer . . •
Q. Mr. Boucher, with all the job inter-
views a graduating engineer goes
through, how can he be reasonably
sure he has made the right choice?
A. This is a good question because
few seniors have enough work ex-
perience in industry, government
and educational institutions to
allow them to make a fully rea-
soned choice. However, I think the
first step is to be sure that short-
term factors like starting salary
and location don't outweigh long-
range factors like opportunity and
professional growth. All of these
factors should be evaluated before
making a final commitment.
Q. But you do feel that starting salary
is important?
A. Very much so. If you are mar-
ried—it may be an even greater
consideration. But you should also
look beyond starting salary. Find
out, for example, if the company
you are considering has a good
salary administration plan. If there
is no way of formally appraising
your performance and determining
your appropriate rewards, you run
the risk of becoming dissatisfied
or stalemated due to neglect of
these important considerations.
0. What considerations do you feel
should be evaluated in reaching a job
decision?
A. Let me refer you to a paper
written by Dr. L. E. Saline, now
Manager of Information Systems
in our Defense Systems Depart-
ment. It is titled "How to Evaluate
Job Offers." (Incidentally, you may
obtain a copy by writing as di-
rected in the last paragraph.) In
it, Dr. Saline proposes six ques-
tions-—the answers to which should
give you much of the information
you'll need for an objective job-
offer evaluation. He suggests you
determine . . .
• to what degree will the work be
challenging and satisfying?
• what opportunities are available
to further develop abilities?
• what opportunities are there for
advancing in the Company (and
how dynamic the Company is in
the marketplace is an important
aspect of this question).
• what salary potentials are pos-
sible with respect to the future?
• what about geographical location
-—-now and in the future?
• what effort does the Company
make to establish and maintain a
professional climate?
There is more to these questions
than meets the eye and I think
you would enjoy reading Dr.
Saline's paper.
Q. What about the openings on de-
fense projects that are listed in the
various magazines and newspapers?
A. Presumably, there will always
be a need for technical manpower
in the defense business. But I
want to point out to you that most
of these opportunities are for ex-
perienced personnel, or personnel
with specific additional training re-
ceived at the graduate level.
Q. How do you feel about training
programs? Do they offer any particular
advantages over any other offer I
might accept?
A. I feel training programs are par-
ticularly helpful in easing the tran-
sition from an academic to a
business environment. Of course
they provide formal training de-
signed to add to the individual's
basic fund of knowledge. They
also provide working experience in
a variety of fields and a broad
knowledge of the company con-
cerned and its scope of operations.
Upon completion, the individual is
generally better prepared to decide
the direction in which he will pur-
sue his professional career.
General Electric conducts a num-
ber of training programs. Those
that attract the greatest number
of engineers are the Engineering
and Science, Manufacturing, and
Technical Marketing Programs.
Each combines a formal, graduate-
level study curriculum, on-the-job
experience, and rotating assign-
ments. There is little question in
my mind that when an engineer
completes the Program of his
choice, he js__farj2etlat prepared to
&lt;::':


choose his field by interest and by
capability. I might also add that
because of this, he is more valuable
to the Company as an employee.
Q. Then you feel that a training pro-
gram is the best alternative for a
graduating engineer?
A. Not always. Some seniors have
already determined the specific
field they are best suited for in
terms of their own interests and
capabilities. In such cases, direct
placement into this specific field
may be more advantageous. Pro-
fessional self-development for these
employees, as for all General Elec-
tric technical employees, is en-
couraged through a variety of
programs including the Company's
Tuition Refund Program for work
toward advanced degrees, in-plant
courses conducted at the graduate
level, and others designed to meet
individual needs.
Q. For the record, how would you
rate a job offer from General Electric?
A. I've tried to get across the need
for factual information and a long-
range outlook as the keys to any
good job evaluation. With respect
to the General Electric Company,
seniors and placement offices have
access to a wide variety of infor-
mation about the Company, its
professional environment and its
personnel practices. I think quali-
fied seniors will also discover that
General Electric offers professional
opportunity second to none—and
starting salaries that are competi-
tive with the average offered
throughout industry today. From
the above, you can see that I
would rate a job offer from General
Electric very highly.

General Electric's training pro-
grams? You can get it, together
