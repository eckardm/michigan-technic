Compact industrial television system — developed at RCA Laboratories—lets us see the unseeable in safety!
Eye-wffness mporfs -/hm cf-fytyfymacei
/
Something's gone wrong in a big blast
furnace, and heat is too high for engi-
neers to approach. Focus the Vidicon
camera of an RCA Industrial Televi-
sion System on the flames and the fiery
furnace can be studied in comfort on a
television receiver.
This is only one suggested use, for
RCA's compact industrial television sys-
tem is as flexible as its users ingenuity.
"Eye" of the tiny camera —small enough
to be held in one hand —is the sensitive
Vidicon tube. The only other equipment
needed is the Vidicon camera's suitcase-
size control cabinet, which operates any-
where on ordinary household current.
The Vidicon camera could be lowered
under water where divers might be en-
dangered— or stand watch on atomic reac-
tions, secure from radiations. And it is prac-
tical to arrange the RCA Industrial Tele-
vision system so that observers can see a
3-dimensional picture . .. real as life!

How Westinghouse
helps TOP MEN
win top spots
Years ago, Westinghouse recognized the
value of education to its employees . . . started
a program to make available every practical
educational advantage.
Today, there is an entire department at
Westinghouse charged with the sole responsi-
bility of recruiting top men for engineering
and sales, manufacture and research . . . and
to provide them with the best available
facilities to develop and advance within the
company. Hundreds of key men throughout
the organization assist in carrying out this
extensive program.
An orientation and training program is
designed to acquaint them with the company,
and to help them find that spot where they will
be most effective and successful.
The training course is supplemented by
a Graduate Study Program, through which
advanced degrees may be obtained from
leading universities.
In these and in other ways, Westinghouse
extends itself to help its carefully selected
employees get ahead in the company and
to achieve true professional status . . . for
Westinghouse management recognizes that
the future of the company can only be as
great as the men who are to assume leadership.

Field Work
The other Sunday we read in the Sun-
day supplement about a Los Angeles ele-
mentary school teacher who spent part of
her summer vacation at an Air Force base,
learning the fine points of jet-propelled
aircraft, et al.; the better to meet her 8-to-
10-year-old pupils on grounds of common
interests—their interests. She teaches at a
progressive school (we might have known
it).
We are happy to announce that this
spirit of Teacher-come-down-out-of-your-
ivory-tower has spread to engineering in-
structors, although on matters less extra-
curricular. More than a score of profes-
sors from leading engineering colleges of
the country spent the summer months
practicing what they teach—actually help-
ing build the complicated electrical equip-
ment they normally meet only in text
books.
The 21 men were backing up text-book
theories with actual practice in an unusual
program sponsored by the Westinghouse
Electric Corporation. During the summer
months, they worked side by side with the
men and women who design and build
electrical apparatus at several of the Com-
pany's divisions.
J. C. McKeon, manager of university
relations for Westinghouse, described the
plan as a "lend-lease" program whereby
the colleges lend professors and Westing-
house gives them practical training, hop
ing in return to get better engineers when
the professors' students graduate.
"Each professor participating in the
program was paid a regular salary by the
company," Mr. McKeon said. "In each
case, he was given an assignment relating
to his particular field and was also given
the opportunity to get a comprehensive
over-all view of the company's opera-
tions."
Typical of the professors who temporar-
ily exchanged the classroom from the in-
dustrial laboratory is Paul B. Jacob, Jr.
An assistant professor of electrical engi-
neering at his alma mater, Mississippi State
College, Mr. Jacob spent his summer at
the Westinghouse High Voltage Engineer-
ing Laboratories, testing various types of
lighting arresters and switchgear.
Among the professors who participated
in this program are: Thomas E. Talpey
(University of Michigan) at the Balti-
more Electronics Division and Samuel
Mercer, Jr., (Michigan State College) at
the Division at South Philadelphia, Pa.
Unit Operations
A team of Michigan University profes-
sors, led by George Granger Brown, pro-
fessor and chairman of the department of
chemical and metallurgical engineering at
the University, have written a new engi-
neering text book entitled Unit Opera-
tions. It was published in September
by John Wiley &amp; Sons.
Five professors in the departments of
chemical and metallurgical engineering—
Donald Laverne Katz, Alan Shivers Foust,
Robert Roy White, William Piatt Wood,
and Richard Schneidewind—and five as-
sistant professors in the same department
—Julius Thomas Banchero, Lloyd Earl
Brownell, George Brymer Williams, Jessie
Louis York, and Joseph H. Martin, col-
laborated with Professor Brown in the
production of the book.
A member of the University faculty for
the past thirty years, Professor Brown re-
ceived his M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees from
Michigan in 1922 and 1924. Eight of his
co-authors are also graduates from the
University of Michigan.
Unit Operations, the first textbook
on the subject in twenty years, presents the
basic principles common to many kinds of
unit operations.
Reserve News
Company grade officers in research and
development units in the Army Organized
Reserve Corps will not be recalled to ac-
tive duty as part of the overall officer
recall program, but will be ordered to
duty by the Department of the Army and
placed in specialized research and devel-
opment posts, the Army announced today.
The action was taken to assign Reserv-
ists with marked technical qualifications to
research positions as vacancies occur and
where their skills can best be utilized in
the interests of national defense.
Orders have been issued to command-
ers to report those specialists already
called to active duty to the Department of
the Army for reassignment.
Only captains and lieutenants assigned
to R &amp; D training units are affected by the
ruling.
Contest for E.E.'s
Mr. R. D. Wasserman, president of
Eutectic Welding Alloys Corporation, an-
nounces his company sponsorship of a
$1,000.00 Prize Competition for Technical
Papers having to do with research and de-
velopment in the field of 'non-fusion'
welding processes.
The prize fund has for its purpose the
offer of more adequate tangible rewards
for scientific and research activity in the
branch of welding that has shown im-
portant progress in recent years yet re-
mains relatively unexplored.
The Eutectic $1,000.00 Prize Competi-
tion opens September 1, 1950 and closes
May 31, 1951. It invites entry of techni-
cal papers by persons in both industrial
and in educational fields.
The subject of papers to present is de-
fined as follows: Technological and Re-
search Aspects, Advances and Advantages
of the Use of Lower Melting (lower than
parent) Filler Metals in the Non-fusion
Welding Processes. Application of such
processes may be by torch, furnace, induc-
tion, carbon arc or metallic arc. Papers
may specifically cover one or more of the
following:
a) Oxy-acetylene, low melting filler
b) Oxy-fuel gas, low melting filler
c) Brazing and bronze welding
d) Hard facing and resurfacing with
low melting filler
Three prizes will be awarded: $500.00
as first prize, $300.00 as second prize and
$200.00 as third prize.
The competition is open to welding
engineers, researchers, metallurgists, in-
structors, university students and all others
qualified to present basic principles of the
art and sciences of non-fusion welding.
Rules governing the competition may
be secured by writing to Eutectic Weld-
ing Alloys Corporation, 40 Worth Street,

out of the briny deep
Metal furniture, lawn mowers, and materials for aircraft
out of the briny deep? Drugs, ink, paper products, fumigants
and photographic plates from ocean water?
Indeed, these products and many more owe their origin to
elements extracted from the brine of the sea and from the
earth's subterranean brines . . . bromine, iodine and
magnesium.
The first of these, bromine, appears in a host of products
which we use daily. For years this basic chemical has been
produced for industry by The Dow Chemical Company.
Bromine and bromine compounds are utilized in many
fields including textiles, petroleum, solvents, fumigation,
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and a variety of others.
In addition to its medicinal use, iodine has manv indus-
trial applications, among them dyes and photographic film.
Magnesium, the lightest of all structural metals, is likewise
extracted from the inexhaustible waters of the sea through
a special process originated by Dow. Proved invaluable for
over a decade in aircraft construction, magnesium today
contributes strength without dead weight to many varied
industrial and consumer applications.
Bromine, iodine, and magnesium are but three of over six
hundred products manufactured by Dow in the interests
of "chemicals indispensable to industry and agriculture."

BY
JOANNE S. MALKUS
Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Physics and Meteorology, Illinois Institute of Technology
The day of the "weather engineer" has
not yet arrived. Not today nor even to-
morrow will a trip to the Weather Bureau
reveal a complicated set of lighted maps
with levers labelled "fair and warmer",
"light rain", etc. In contrast to the profes-
sion of engineering, which is one of do-
ing, building, and designing, stands that
of the meteorologist whose main function
is to predict.
That this prediction is often far from
perfect is evident by the great number of
jokes, cartoons, and radio programs of
which the somewhat defensive weather-
man is the butt. Still, this motley humor
reveals something more than the imperfec-
tions of our well-meaning civil servants in
the weather station. It reveals the fact that
the celebrated man in the street, despite
his acquaintance with nuclear fission and
relativity, is still unaware of how the
weather really works. And this is no dis-
grace, since for sheer complexity atmo-
spheric problems are at least as difficult of
solution as those of the atomic nucleus of
the stellar universe.
And yet, the atmosphere is the medium
in which man carries on his daily life. It
is as much his element as the sea is that of
fish. Adverse weather may mean only a
ruined vacation to the city-dweller, but it
may spell flood or dustbowl to the farmer,
and life or death to the air passenger. The
famous Armistice Day storm of 1940
brought broken signs and show-windows
to Chicagoans, but outside the city, 150,-
000 turkeys, thousands of cattle and live-
stock, three large lake steamers, and 157
human lives were lost.
Just as the atmosphere is the medium
in which man lives, it is the medium in
which the engineer works, and with whose
behavior symptoms, the weather, he must
continually contend. A man building a
dam must know how much water the struc-
ture will be called upon to handle, a fact
that is determined to a large extent by the
rainfall characteristics of the watershed.
The pattern in the central Mississippi Val-
ley, where the greatest rain is felt in May,
is quite different from that of New Eng-
land where each month sees almost the
same amount of precipitation, although
the total yearly rainfalls of the two regions
are nearly equal.
A man designing an airplane must
know what stresses may act on its wings.
He must realize that the greatest structural
damage to aircraft occurs in thunder-
storms, where, due to updrafts and down-
drafts, side-by-side, relative vertical veloc-
ities often exceed 100 miles per hour, and
where ascending currents can support hail-
stones the size) of eggs. He must also be
aware that these same conditions give rise
to severe icing, and that the presence of
liquid water cooled below its freezing
point is vital in the growth of the great
cloud-factory, cumulo nimbus.
An engineer envisioning the growth of
a great air terminal with day and night
passenger service to far-flung points must
know well the wind and weather charac-
teristics of the site. He must know how
to avoid the lee-side of smoke-stacks, the
fog-covered valley bottom, and the ocean
promontory. He must be aware of the
wind structure in the first 50 feet above
the ground, because all take-offs and land-
breeze (only an average-strong wind)
blew against the long, too slender span,
it began to oscillate in a twisting manner,
more and more violently, until the road-
bed and cables could no longer stand the
strain. Other bridges have collapsed when
set into straight up and down oscillations
which grew larger and more violent with
time. Such "instability", which is inherent
in the structure itself, can be excited in
several different ways, including the fam-
ous example of the marching feet of sol-
diers, but the least controllable and most
ubiquitous external agent is the motion of
the earth's atmosphere in the form of
wind.
Therefore, to design and build future
bridges which will avoid the perilous fate
of Leaping Lena, the skills of several
types of experts must be called on in col-
laboration. First and foremost, the civil
engineer must determine, either by cal-
culation or experiment, what pressures
across the bridge structure are created by a

fects of wind on structures.

disastrous result of a wind-
storm on the ill-fated Tacoma
Narrows bridge.

ings are made in that region. Indeed, the
opportunities for the use of weather
knowledge in engineering are far more
extensive than can be indicated here.
At this point it is well to bring up the
well-publicized collapse of the Tacoma
Narrow Bridge (unfortunately living up
to its nickname "Leaping Lena") in No-
vember, 1947, just four months after
having been opened to traffic.
In this six-and-one-half million dollar
tragedy, the basic miscreant was meteoro-
logical—a high wind. As the 30-40 mph

wind of given direction and speed. He
must then determine how his particular
bridge will respond to this distribution of
pressure; whether it will twist or vibrate
excessively, or whether it can be construct-
ed so that such motions will either be auto-
matically damped out or totally absent.
In this task, the engineer is greatly aid-
ed by the aerodynamicist, whose ingenious
technique of testing small-scale models in
a wind tunnel to predict the behavior of
large-scale objects in an air stream can

As everyone knows, I am a mathemati-
cal genius. I have always been a mathe-
matical genius. I was destined from
birth to not only solve the world's most
complex problems but to simplify them
so much that life will take on a new pat-
tern. It is my destiny to show the people
of the world that their antiquated concepts
of the interelation of things are obsolete
and to show them the new, simple intere-
lation of things.
My father recognized this destiny al-
most as soon as I was born and so my
first playthings were a vernier sliderule
and a book of integrals. This early start
led me to discover a finite infinity at the
age of 4 years, iy2 months.
However, since to do so I made use of
the revolutionary variable constant, the
publication of the discovery was sup-
pressed by certain reactionaries in mathe-
matical circles.
All my life it has been thus, a constant
struggle against narrow minds and limited
conceptions. However, I have now over-
come them all and it is with great pride
that I present to the world the work to
which I have devoted my life, "The
Theory of Luniticity." This theory, by
showing the true interelation of things
conceivable will take the hum-drum out of
existence and make life a sparkling, en-
joyable experience to all.
The name of the Theory of Lunaticity
was well chosen. It is derived from the
Latin root "luna" meaning moon. The
reason for this choice, as you will soon
see, is that without the presence of the
moon and the operation of this principle,
our earth would be much closer to the sun.
It would be so much closer that there
would probably be no life on earth.
Let us begin with the definition of
space; (not a mathematical definition but
a purely substantive definition.) Space is
a complete void, the absence of all body.
This definition is simple and shall be the
basic premise upon which the Theory of
Lunaticity is explained.
Now if space is the absence of all body,
space must end where body begins. There-
fore, the limitations of space are the be-
ginnings of body. Now since there is only
body and space in the universe, any point
which is a limit point of a body, (on the
surface of a body) is also a limit point of
space.

Once you have digested that, it will be
easy to see that the total surface area of
all body is also the total surface area of
space, because the sum of all limit points
of the body is the same as the sum of all
the limit points of space. The sum of all
the limit points of anything is its area.
This may also be stated:
(1)
Where n is the number of limit points
taken and a is the area of a point.
From our basic supposition we have de-
duced the fact that the surface area of
space is equal to the total surface area of
all body in space.
Now for the volume of space. It is
easy to see that the volume of anything
is directly proportional in some way to its
surface area but just in case there are
skeptics I will develop the point further.
To be truly analytical we must go to
the surface of subatomic particles to find
the surface of space and it is well known
that they are at least near-spherical in
shape. Since the integral of the surface
area of a sphere is its volume, we can sur-
mise that the total volume of space is the
integral of the total surface area of all
body space.
This may also be expressed by the in-
tegral:
Vt = Jda (2)
Where Vt = total volume of space; A =
f (a), =» a function of the area of a unit
point (a) and = to the total surface area
of body in space, (a) as in (1).
This is only saying that the volume of
space is proportional to the total volume
of body in space. There we have the basic
principle behind the Theory of Luna-
ticity.
This lengthy and detailed explanation
is not all just for the sake of interest. The
Theory of Lunaticity is a working theory.
It has many practical applications. For
instance:
With the operation of this principle it
can be seen that those frequent and an-
noying collisions on the dance floor would
be almost completely eliminated. The
more people there are dancing, the more
space there would be for dancing since
the addition of people to the dance floor
would add to the total body upon the floor
and the amount of space is directly pro-
portional to the amount of body in the
space. The socially minded should find
this quite pleasing.
This is just one of the many applica-
tions of the principle. There are many
others. To name a few:
The more food that a person eats,
the more he will be able to eat. The
more food in his stomach, the more
room for food. This is my gift to gour-
mets. There is an auxiliary advantage to
this. The more beer a person consumes
the greater his capacity. This is my gift
to the L.S.A. student.
As previously pointed out, the pres-
ence of the body of the moon between
us and the sun increases the amount of
space between us and the sun and hence
saves us from destruction by intense
heat.
In science, it explains the previously
unfathomed growth of the universe.
Everyone knows that the population of
the earth has always been on the in-
crease. This increases the amount of
space in the universe, hence our neigh-
boring celestial bodies are growing
farther away.
It can easily be seen that The Theory
of Lunaticity will be a boon to mankind.
Wherever there is a shortage of space
simply try to fill it up and with the
aid of the new theory you will get unr
limited space.
Yes, the Theory of Lunaticity has a great
many practical applications. I grant that
it is revolutionary, but the people of the
world shall soon be feeling the impact of
it on their daily lives. Life will be won-
derful and I shall feel that I have done
my bit for mankind.
The modern coed's hair may look like a
mop, but that doesn't bother her—she
doesn't know what a mop looks like.
Virginia: All right. We'll drive right
where I hurt my hip?
Tom: No.
Virginia: All right. We'll drive right
by there.

Ph.D., Assoc. Prof, of Child Development, School of Education, U. of M.
The investment in the growth and edu-
cation of a child by parents and by society
amounts to about $250,000. The invest-
ment is made in food, housing, education,
social learning, psychological well-being,
and so on.
The direct cost to parents is around
$25,000. In addition to the direct cost
there is the use of around 40,000 hours of
parent time devoted to child-care, plan-
ning and worry. The balance of the cost
is provided by society. Some charges are
direct such as education and recreation;
others are indirect and could be elaborated
under the general heading of—providing
a respectable community in which the chil-
dren will grow up.
When the investment is managed with
reason and skill, the child—now and
adult—gives a very high return to society
and to himself. When handled with little
reason and poor skill this same child can
become a monetary liability to people by
amounts varying between 50,000 and
250,000 dollars. Additional dangers that
are impossible to measure in monetary
terms accrue to society and to the person.
Therefore it is as important to manage the
investment in children on the basis of
knowledge and reason as it is to manage
investments in industry and engineering
on the basis of a well-founded realism.
The methods for satisfactory financing of
children are different; the values involved
also are higher.

Surely no sensible engineer would at-
tempt to practice, his profession without
having sound knowledge on engineering
principles. Certainly he would not attempt
to solve new problems without first secur-
ing new knowledge, well-documented in
evidence obtained by precision methods.
Faith in non-technical opinion and wide
usage of old-wives tales are regarded as
slightly indecent in engineering. We need
to be careful or our bridges will collapse
and our engine will explode. Children are
no different. Blind faith, sheer ignorance,
or haphazard bits of loosely-constructed
knowledge cannot serve as a sound foun-
dation for managing a child investment.
Any contrary point-of-view is not only
silly but dangerous.

The research work in the Elementary
School at the U. of M. has been directed
for the past twenty years towards under-
standing the nature and significance of
growth. The term growth is applied to
all things that change with age. The most
obvious difference between children of
various ages is the size and proportion of
the body. Children grow in motor func-
tion as they progress from creeping to
standing, to walking, to running and jump-
ing. Language growth becomes apparent
in the transition from the babbling of in-
fancy to the use of understandable words
and then sentences of later life. Evidences
of growth in school are found in the abil-
ity to pay attention for longer periods, to
turn out more and more work, and to
solve problems of increasing complexity.
Social growth is reflected in the child's
increasing ability to assume responsibility
in the family, the neighborhood, and the

community. The contrast between the un-
inhibited outbursts of crying and temper
tantrums in early childhood and the more
controlled ones in later years is evidence
of emotional growth.
The goals of child rearing encompass a
healthy body, a trained intellect, and emo-
tional serenity. The modern parent and
teacher is concerned inevitably with all
aspects of growing since there is an inter-
dependence among them.
A few important concepts of growth
can be demonstrated by presenting a
graphical analysis of the growth of indi-
vidual children. The data in these figures
illustrate some of the ways children grow.
The values on the abscissa are the number
of months that have elapsed from that ar-
bitrary point in development which we
call birth. The ordinate values, which we
growth ages, are the points where the
measure obtained .from the individual
child intercepts the arithmetic average of
the same measure taken from children in
general. Thus a child 50 inches tall has a
growth age of 96 months irrespective of

BY
A. D. MOORE
MS, Professor of Electrical Engineering
For the student who wants
a job—and who doesn't?—
some brief, pointed ideas.
You do not know how to write a job-
hunting letter. That goes, literally,
for nine of you out of ten. And you had
better learn. Last week I sat in the office
of a Detroit business man, who had ad-
vertised for an engineering sales assist-
ant. He showed me a stack of letter of
application. Except for about two let-
ters, the stack was not worth the trouble
involved in pushing it into the waste
basket.
When you write that letter, either
conform to business usage and put it on
8.5 by 11, or don't write it. Never write
it on someone else's stationary. Ordinary
business correspondence never appears
except in typed form. Neither should
yours. You may type the letter yourself
if you can do a good job that is no com-
promise with shoddiness in any respect;
otherwise, get somebody to type it for
you. Let handwriting be but a reluct-
antly adopted alternative. If you must
write by hand, either do a good job or
let it go.
Imagination and the creative instinct
are valuable assets, but not when ap-
plied to the formal parts of a letter of
application. Please, please do not assume
that you know all about this letter busi-
ness. Get a copy of Hadida's Pitfalls in
English (Putnam) or some such manual,
and find out exactly how these things are
done. While on a tender subject, what of
your spelling? Think of the graduates
who have written back to me and spelled
it "Proffesor." Note the many seniors
who write "proceedure." Dwell on the
case of the man who spends four years
playing with our apparatus, and still
writes and speaks of "lavatory," meaning
laboratory. The pertinent question is:
are you wise enough to know that your
spelling is shaky somewhere, and do you
know enough to have a friend check over
your letters before you send them?
Letter Content
Design the letter with care. Very often,
the purpose of the letter is to secure an

A. D. MOORE
interview. The almost invariable rule is:
no interview, no job. Hiring sight unseen
is extremely rare. When your letter gets
there, it is the only thing there to repre-
sent you. Unless it is one of the few that
commands attention and earns respect,
you are accepting an almost insurmount-
able handicap from the very start. The
interview is not granted. Or if it is, the
employer is likely to sit before you, con-
stantly reminding himself that "this is the
chap who used his girl's perfumed sta-
tionery; his fountain pen ran out halfway,
making it a two-color job; he failed to get
my title right; he ended in a rush with
'Very truly yrs.'; yes, I remember this
man's letter."
What to say? So many exceptions come
in, that the subject is too broad to attempt
writing comprehensive rules here. Care-
fully think out the minimum require-
ments; find the things you must say, then
say them concisely and clearly. Beyond
such a limit you hardly dare go, unless
you are one of the few, blessed with
imagination, good taste, and maturity of
judgment, who knows he can add touches
lending a personal distinction to an other-
wise prosaic document. If you can do this,
it is invaluable. If not, emphatically do
not try it; it would turn an otherwise suc-
cessful business letter into something
ludicrous.
Some day, as an engineer, you will
have to send an engineering report by
mail. The situation also calls for a letter
of transmittal. You would not dream of
thinking that, since you must write a
letter anyway, you should recast the
whole report and shove it bodily into the
letter of transmittal. Now, a similar mis-
take can be made if you try to cram all
the factual data about yourself into your
letter of application. If you had an engi-
neering report on yourself, you would
mail it to the employer, and your letter
of transmittal would become a letter of
application. This brings us to—
The Typed Personal Record
The personal record may be thought of
as a special form of engineering report.
Its subject is—you. It is typed. It is in
outline form. Every item is so presented
as to be easily found. It must always give
the minimum required facts. It may con-
tain more, depending on your judgment.
The form, the general appearance, the
sequence of classifications— these con-
stitute a make-up or design that should
be your own. A wide latitude exists with-
in which your material can be suitably
arranged. Do not make your job look
exactly like one you have seen; consciously
make it your own, to give it individuality.
That the paper should be standard size
need not be mentioned.
The personal record may vary from
one to five pages in length. Many recent
graduates who have filed records with
me usually manage to cover between one
and two pages. A graduate ten years
out may have to adopt an ingenious tabu-
lating scheme to compress his varied ex-
perience into an acceptably short docu-
ment.
The record serves at least three needs.
It enables you, perhaps for the first time,
to know your own experience, training,
education, and value. When a copy is
filed with your faculty placement officer,
you are giving him just the fine coopera-
tion he needs in helping to place you now
or later. And a copy placed with the em-
ployer presents you to him in the form
of a high-grade report. These needs in-
dicate the content.
Content of the Personal Record
1. Photograph. Perhaps the home town
paper honored your departure for college
with a story, and wisely included a pic-
ture to prove to the incredulous that there
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


you saved a clipping. Leave it intact;
that half-tone print will not serve here.
As a senior, you are being photographed
for the 'Ens/an, to a size of 4 by 6. In
general, that is too large. Get a relatively
inexpensive photograph made, size 3 by 4
or a little smaller. Never send a snapshot
or a bad photograph; omit entirely rather
than compromise. Never place the pic-
ture on the record so that it will be folded
and creased in mailing.
2. Personal Facts. Such items as name,
address, telephone number, date of the
record itself, your age at that date, place
of birth, height, weight, state of health,
whether married, whether there are chil-
dren or other dependents—these usually
head the record in outline form.
3. Affiliations. Memberships in honor
and professional societies are given.
4. Education, Training. The high
school may or may not be mentioned.
The college, degree, and date of gradua-
tion must be given. A breath-taking omis-
sion occurred when one of our graduates
remembered everything except to say in
his record, that he ever graduated any-
where. Advanced degrees are of course
mentioned. Any special training, such
as one gets within numerous industrial
training set-ups, is set forth.
Under Education, some go so far as
to list all college courses taken. Probably
the typical employer would consider this
as going too far with detail. However,
a selected list of courses considered most
valuable and which might be most perti-
nent for a certain kind of employment
ought to go in.
5. Experience. Err on the side of com-
pleteness. Tell the jobs you have held
before, during, and after college. One
little item, such as selling groceries one
summer, may seem insignificant to you;
it may turn out to be the very thing that
separates you from the group of appli-
cants and hands you the job. Selling
groceries is sales experience, it means
getting along with fellow hustlers, and
it involves meeting the customers—pleas-
ant, cantankerous, and all kinds between.
Did you earn college expenses on some
menial job in the hospital? Then you are

one of the very few graduates having any
kind of extended hospital contact what-
ever. A manufacturer of therapeutic ap-
paratus might want you for design, de-
velopment, or sales. Companies making
unusual finishes, paints, flooring materials,
sound absorption materials, surgical sup-
plies—all these would prefer a man who
had happened to spend four years work-
ing in any capacity in a hospital, to others
who had not.
6. Activities. (Remember, the se-
quence of divisions is up to you; if you
prefer to list Activities right below Edu-
cation, do so. I'm putting them here to
be sure they get into the story.) Class
offices, memberships and offices held in
societies and student activities—all should
be mentioned. Does every employer ex-
pect that all his recruited graduates shall
have a long record of activities? Not at
all. Some would pay no attention to it.
A few might even object to it, when
looking for a certain type of man. Most
of them will tolerate a decent amount of
activity background, and many will in-
sist on some.
7. New Objects Planned, Designed, or
Built. Here we come to the gadgets.
Many seniors have been tinkering for
years, planning or building model en-
gines, model airplanes, radio sets, and
so on. Make clear those that were really
built, as against those that never got
beyond the design stage. The late B. G.
Lamme, so long and so eminently the
chief engineer for Westinghouse Electric,
interviewed thousands of graduates. He
always inquired into this kind of self-
imposed activity. He considered it essen-
tial to the make-up of every to-be-success-
ful engineer. It may well be that he gave
the matter undue emphasis; but due to
his influence, you may be assured that
many employers of engineers think the
same way about it.
8. Special interests. You can bring
these out strikingly, in part, by putting
red stars on those courses (under Educa-
tion) whose content most represents the
lines you wish to follow. A footnote can
explain the stars. Then, in a paragraph
or two, state your special interests. One
of our men roomed in the house of a mar-
ried "Medic" student; due to long talk-
fests there, and with other particular moti-
vations, he took an unusual dose of work
in the Arts college. He wound up with a
permanent and informed interest in so-
ciology, mental hygiene, medicine, medi-
cal apparatus; and said so in his personal
record. Another man stated that he had

Jet Periscope
A 12-foot periscope for looking into
the fiery exhaust of a jet engine has been
developed by engineers of the General
Electric Company.
The quarter-ton steel cylinder has been
designed to let jet engineers look squarely
up the exhaust pipe to see the pattern of
burning gases. One end of the periscope
is placed 10 feet behind the jet engine
under study, and is capable of withstand-
ing the 2500-degree blast of exhaust.
The periscope is jacketed in thick stain-
less steel, beneath which is a 45-gallon-
per-minute water-cooling system, for car-
rying away the terrific heat of the exhaust.
A quartz window, both air-cooled and
water-cooled, looks up the business end of
the engine. The air-cooling system blows
a stream of cold air over the quartz win-
dow, preventing the exhaust gases from
reaching it.
The equipment is being used in a test
chamber by the company's Aircraft Gas
Turbine Divisions at Lynn, Mass. There
it is mounted in a wall in such a manner
that engineers are able to observe while
protected from the exhaust by the wall.
Image of the burning gases is trans-
mitted through the tube to observers by
means of a conventional optical system.
On the viewers' end of the periscope are a
16-millimeter motion picture camera, an
eyepiece for an observer, and a large, tele-
vision-like screen which several persons
may watch.
Finish for Aluminum
A new scratch and wear resistant hard
coating for aluminum, which makes this
light metal eligible for the first time in
many applications heretofore largely
monopolized by steel alloys, has been de-
veloped in its engineering laboratory as a
result of the Martin Company's over-all
program of aeronautical research.
Designated as "MHC" finish, the new
Martin hard coating for aluminum opens
a way for the industry to take fuller ad-
vantage of the light-weight attribute of
this metal in the manufacture of aircraft.
It has been necessary—until now—to rely
on other materials for all structures requir-
ing high scratch and wear resistance.
Standard tests performed on a Taber
Abrasion Tester, using rubber bonded

Jet Periscope.
Courtesy General Electric
abrasive wheels with a 1000-gram load-
ing, have shown the new coatings to pos-
sess remarkable characteristics in this re-
spect. After 50,000 cycles, for example,
MHC samples evidenced only half as much
wear as did cyanide case-hardened steel.
For surfaces exposed to hard wear, it
has been customary to use high strength
steel alloys, surface-hardened carbon steels
or chrome plate. In many cases the su-
perior strength of the steel part is of no
importance to its successful application.
The weight saving effected through use of
the Martin finish has already proved of
considerable value in aircraft construction.
In a typical instance, MHC-treated alum-
inum bearing races saved 40 lbs. over the
conventional steel assembly.
The Martin hard coating has proved out
well in its application to the leading edges
of high-speed airfoils, which are suscept-
ible to wearing by the surface attrition
of dust and rain. Helicopter rotor blade
tips, which must often be revved up in
clouds of dust, sand or cinders, represent
another noteworthy adaptation. Taking
advantage of the lighter metal, many di-
rect MHC-finished aluminum substitutions
for steel are being made today in the case
of moving parts for Martin airplanes—as
well as for static surfaces exposed to se-
vere scuffing or other forms of wear.
A variety of items, from cylinders, bear-
ing surfaces and jack-screw threads, which
latter would seize if uncoated, to airplane
door thresholds and mechanic's wrenches,
exemplify the weight and cost savings re-
dounding to the Martin Company through
aeronautical uses of MHC.
Fields outside the aviation industry, of
course, provide a great many additional
applications for the coating. A sample lot
of 5,000 leg braces of the type used by
disabled veterans recently passed a series
of laboratory tests for wear resistance,
after hard-coating by the MHC process.
Causing rapid wear, sand and abrasive
dust particles to which the hinges are ex-
posed have occasioned a high percentage
of failures to unprocessed aluminum ankle
joints.
With respect to the coating's thermal
stability, due to a difference in coefficients
of expansion between the base aluminum
alloy and the hard finish, checking of the

The Student and Military Preparedness
Again many American youths face a disruption of their
carefully laid plans. A tour of duty in the military services
looms ahead for those who have not already made a payment
to Uncle Sam on the debt they owe for the opportunities open
to the youth of this country.
But this is not an unusual condition for youth to face.
The past thirty-five years have been so filled with crises that
living under such circumstances seems to be almost a normal
situation. All along the road down through history the human
race has been meeting and participating in explosive situations
and from them it has frequently drawn strength and under-
standing.
And so I venture to say it will be in the present case—
both from the national outlook and from the narrower view-
point of the individual student. As a nation we are learning
that the prospects for preserving peace are greater when many
nations act together and when all keep themselves in a healthy
condition of preparedness. Concerted action and proper pre-
paredness will preserve for us our democratic freedoms insofar
as outside threats are concerned.
The engineering student may learn much of real value dur-
ing a period of military training. He, in turn, is highly valued
by the military services. Such training (education) will incul-
cate some of the principles of leadership. Intimate association
on an equal footing with all types of young Americans should
give him a realistic insight into democracy.
Those students who are privileged to remain in college will
appreciate the opportunity to make themselves of greater value
to the country and at the same time to continue with their
educations.
Some Statistics
The bulletin of the College of Engineering for 1948-49
shows that the total enrollment of undergraduates for the first
semester of the academic year 1947-48 was 4166. Graduate
students were present to the extent of 667; a total of 4833.
As of October 1, 1950, undergraduates in the College num-
bered 2359, graduate students 481; total 2840.
During the first semester of 1941-42, the corresponding
figures were 2263 and 127, for a total of 2400.
The College of Engineering is rapidly approaching its pre-
war size. With the graduation of large numbers of veterans,
other engineering colleges of the country are going through
the same experience.
Know Your University
The modern state university is composed of many divisions,
some of only incidental interest to the student of engineering
while others, when discovered, may add much to his store of
pleasure and to his education. Visits to the museums, attend-
ance at concerts and public lectures, inspections of laboratories
and libraries, all within the time limits of the individual,
should not be overlooked.
Employment Situation
A news release entitled "Employment Outlook for Engi-
neers" issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in March of this
year indicated that available engineering jobs would be con-
siderably less than the number of graduates who are looking
for them. This release was copied in several national maga-
zines and in the press generally and, of course, conveyed the
erroneous impression that many graduates of the class of 1950
would not find employment in engineering work.
Prior to the outbreak of the "hot war" in Korea, contrary
to the forecast of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 1950
class of graduates had been largely absorbed. Since then, the
calls for young engineers have largely outnumbered the avail-
able candidates.
Present indications point to a very real scarcity of young
engineers during the next few years. The Engineers Joint
Council reported in 1949 that the 35,000 graduates of the June
class of that year had been placed in engineering jobs. It is
estimated that in the fall of 1950 there will not be more than
36,000 entering freshmen in our colleges of engineering and
this will mean that there will probably be about 20,000 gradu-
ates in June of 1953. The freshmen enrollments of the past
two years have been small—about the same in number as the
engineering schools had prior to World War II, with more
positions available than there were at that time. It is certain
that for a number of years there will be more openings for
engineering graduates than there will be young engineers to
fill them. We have already entered a period of shortage, so
far as young engineers are concerned.

Bright New World
From MORNING TILL NIGHT, the colors of the rainbow are
all around you—through plastics. A blue plastic clock wakes
you, and you flip on an ivory plastic light switch. You take
your clothes from a yellow plastic hanger. Plastic tooth-
brushes come in colors for every member of the family.
Cheerful decorating schemes are enhanced by the beauty
of plastic drapes. There's no limit to the colors you can get
in these versatile materials!
But this is only the start of the plastic story. Plastics
help make better clothing. Modern furniture and furnish-
ings owe much to plastics. Much of your food is packaged
in clean, clear plastics. Plastics add safety, durability, and
appearance to many of your electrical appliances.
These versatile basic materials are man-made. Organic
chemicals are the ingredients of the "unfinished" plastics
—called resins. From these resins come the many different
forms of plastics we know.
The people of Union Carbide are leaders in the produc-
tion of plastics, resins, and related chemicals. They also
provide hundreds of other materials for the use of science
and industry.

exceed 200° F. The coating shows no
tendency to spall, however, and the check-
ing does not materially affect its corro-
sion resistance. MHC-processed surfaces
also afford a definite margin of heat-insu-
lating protection to the base aluminum,
when exposed for short periods to very
high temperatures.
The Martin finish is applied to alumi-
num and aluminum alloys containing less
than 5% copper, either in the wrought
or cast form, by an electro-chemical process
which creates a non-metallic, file-hard,
highly heat-refractive surface—strongly
bonded to the base metal. Surface smooth-
ness, in general, is closely maintained in
the processing. When specific areas of
parts are to be hard-coated, and the rest
of the part anodized or left untreated,
areas that are not to have the MHC finish
are masked off.
The Martin coating provides excellent
resistance to atmospheric and salt water
corrosion, as is evidenced by test panels
with .002-inch MHC films, which show
little corrosion after 14 months of con-
tinuous exposure. The hard coating has
proven to be far superior to conventional
anodized surfaces.
As for electrical resistance, MHC film
is a non-conductor and serves as a good
insulator. Standard anodic films show a
voltage breakdown of about 340 volts—
against a range of 500 to 3700 volts for
the hard coatings. Though the MHC fin-
ish is attacked by strong acids and alkalis,
it is proof against most commonplace
chemicals.
Advantage can readily be taken of the
dimensional growth of parts under MHC
processing. This permits salvage of gears
that would otherwise have to be replaced.
While the MHC hard coating process
is relatively expensive, as currently ap-
plied on a purely experimental basis in
the Martin engineering laboratory, on a
production scale it would probably com-
part in cost with such operations as the
heat-treating of steel. It may be noted, in
any case, that the new process would be
considerably cheaper than that of hard
chrome plating.
High-Speed Photography
High-speed photography has come to
the aid of U. S. Navy research scientists
working on torpedo design at the Naval
Ordnance Test Station, Pasadena, Califor-
nia.

(Continued from page 16)
Photographic techniques used in per-
formance tests of high-speed torpedos and
other 'air-to-water missiles are described in
an article by William H. Christie in the
current issue of "Photographic Science and
Technique," quarterly technical supple-
ment of the Photographic Society of
America's "PSA Journal."
Navy scientists are using high-speed
motion picture cameras set up on torpedo
ranges at the Morris Dam reservoir in San
Gabriel Canyon to record accurately the
behavior of projectiles being tested.
A variable-angle pneumatic launcher
fires projectiles into the water, and as
many as seven cameras record their
courses.
Special motion picture studies of the im-
pact of missiles with the water are made
with Eastman High-Speed cameras at
speeds as high as 1,200 frames per second.
Study of the results provides valuable data

Martin engineers on the P5M-1 Marlin
project have come up with a pair of
hinged, underwater flaps for flying boats
which serve the double capacity of stern
rudders for increasing maneuverability and
brakes.
Thus two of the seaplane's most trouble-
some features—slow maneuvering in
water and inability to make quick stops
while taxiing—have been overcome, at
least to a considerable extent.
Need for such a device became evident
during the tests of the XP5M-1, which
features a long afterbody for greater stabil-
ity in water during taxiing, takeoff runs
and afterjaading. The additional amount
of hull fewetlr the keel and the chine

correct position for photographing a

Three 70 mm motion picture cameras
protected by concrete sheds photograph
side views. Other cameras record the tor-
pedo course from behind the launching
platform and from an aerial cable sus-
pended above the range.
Standard searchlights are used for il-
lumination when sunlight is insufficient.
Before full-scale models are tested on
the Morris Dam torpedo ranges, Navy
scientists test miniature models in the
model laboratory at Pasadena Annex. Here
small-scale missiles of various types are
tested by firing them at relatively high
ing to the control surfaces. At the same
time, however, this additional amount of
hull under water greatly increased the
"stiffness" of the airplane in maneuvering
to a buoy, for instance, or to get through a
breakwater opening into a sheltered basin.
Operated by the pilot, the flaps may be
used individually or as a pair. Hydraulic
power is actuated through electrical sole-
noids. The flaps may be opened at any
time to their full 65 degree angle, but an
automatic spill-over is provided so that if
the pressure is too great the flaps will re-
tract of themselves to a point where they
can withstand the pressure.

Liquid Nitrogen
Rapid, effective pulverization of previ-
ously hard- or impossible-to-grind mater-
ials now can be accomplished by a method
developed by The Linde Air Products
Company, Unit of Union Carbide and Car-
bon Corporation. The new technique uses
liquid nitrogen, in spray form, to cool the
material rapidly to a point of maximum
fragility, and thereby reduce the amount
of energy required for its fracture. Effi-
ciency is such that the new process prom-
ises to accelerate the high-speed pulveriza-
tion of mechanically-tough or heat-sensi-
tive materials such as plastics, pharmaceu-
ticals, insecticides, food stuffs, substances
containing vitamins, and other organic
materials.
By the new "Linde" method, previously
difficult-to-grind materials are being pul-
verized at rates, in some cases, of over
700 pounds per hour using small 5 H.P.
hammer mills. Saran and polystyrene,
previously resistant to speedy pulveriza-
tion, are being successfully production-
ground by this method.
The new pulverization process employs
the same type of liquid nitrogen now
widely used industrially in rapidly cooling
precision metallic components for shrink
fitting. Commercial liquid nitrogen can
maintain a temperature as low as —320°
F. As a liquid, it can cool a substance
more rapidly than solid refrigerants be-
cause it is capable of more efficient heat
transfer. It can be used in direct contact
with other materials because it is inert and
passes off as a gas. The high temperature
differential between liquid nitrogen's
—320° F. and materials at room tempera-
ture results in maximum cooling rates.
Use of this process promises to be ad-
vantageous where:
1. Materials too tough to grind by con-
ventional methods become friable
and more easily pulverized at very
low temperatures.
2. Materials with low melting points
normally overheat and prevent con-
tinuous grinding, or grinding re-
sults in torn rather than sharply de-
fined particles.
3. Higher pulverizing rates or continu-
ous pulverization are desired with-
out any increase in plant facilities.
4. An inert atmosphere is required to
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page, 20)
pulverize explosive or oxidizable
materials.
5. A low mill atemperature will pre-
vent loss of aromatics or volatiles.
6. A much greater, more rapid cool-
ing effect is required.
7. A constant level of deep refrigera-
tion or unusual temperature control
is required.
In operation, liquid nitrogen from a
portable source is injected into a special
heat exchanger installed between the feed
hopper and a highspeed stainless steel pul-

verizing mill. The fine liquid nitrogen
spray plays on the material passing to the
mill cooling it by direct contact heat trans-
fer and simple evaporation. Cold gaseous
nitrogen which is evolved, precools the
material in the feed hopper, and effec-
tively excludes room air which could
raise the temperature of the system. It has
not been necessary thus far to take ad-
vantage of the —320° F. temperature pos-
sible with liquid nitrogen to embrittle any
material fully prior to grinding.
At the present time, liquid nitrogen
pulverization is limited to moderate- and
high-cost materials that are able to absorb
the added grinding cost. In general this
cost depends on the type of material to be
ground, scale of grinding operations, and
the proximity of liquid nitrogen storage
depots. Pulverization of granular ethyl
cellulose consumes 1 lb. of liquid nitrogen
for each 9 lb. of final grind. Under simi-
lar conditions a tougher material may con-
sume 5 lb. of the refrigerant per pound
of grind, while a more friable material
such as 100% DDT may require but 1 lb.
of liquid nitrogen for every 10 to 20 lb.
of material.
The potential applications of liquid ni-
trogen pulverization have not yet been de-
fined fully because of the unique nature
of the refrigerant. However, results show
that the process should prove highly ef-
fective when applied to the commercial
grinding of:
1. Plastics such as saran; styrenes;
ultra-fine acrylates intended for den-
tures; synthetic Buna "N" rubber.
2. Insecticides such as DDT and Toxi-
phene.
Pharmaceuticals, primarily glandu-
lar products and biologicals such as
penicillin and sulfa drugs.
4. Foodstuffs such as mace and nut-
meg spices, coffee, cocoa, gelatin,
agar-agar and Irish Moss seaweeds;
extract oils made by alcohol leach-
ing of finely ground material.
5. Any substance containing Vitamin
"A" or carotene (pro-vitamin
"A"), both of which are very sen-
sitive to oxidation.
Electronic "Crew"
Manned only by an electronic "crew," a
robot lightship—first ever built for ocean
duty—will soon be helping to guide ship-
ping into the nation's busiest port.
The U. S. Coast Guard disclosed in
Washington that the 91-foot-long light-
ship "EXP-99" is nearing completion at
Curtis Bay, Maryland.
With the aid of a remote control sys-
tem a single operator at the Sandy Hook,
New Jersey, Coast Guard Station will have
complete control over the lightship's sig-
nalling syzstem.
Key to successful operation of the crew-
less lightship is the remote control sys-
tem, called Visicode, explanied W. A.
Derr, Westinghouse engineer, who help-
ed plan the installatoin for the Coast
Guard.
The Visicode equipment, Mr. Derr
said, uses short radio waves to send orders
from the shore station to the ship. There
the waves are picked up by a receiver,
executed by sensitive relays, and a return
signal is sent to the operator notifying
him that the proper equipment is operat-
ing.
Mr. Derr gave this explanation of the
Visicode operation:

in working order, the operator on shore

Have No Place in Production—
or in Your Future Progress!
by CHESTER E. MEYER
Superintendent, Production Scheduling
General Machinery Division
ALLIS-CHALMERS MANUFACTURING COMPANY
(Graduate Training Course 1938)

Production control in a big plant like
the Allis-Chalmers West Allis Works
is a constant campaign to prevent bottle-
necks and keep orders
moving along smoothly
to meet scheduled ship-
ping dates.
Most men face much
the same kind of per-
sonal problem when they
get out of engineering
/ school and plan a pro-
chestere. Meyer gram °f graduate train-
ing and experience
leading to a firm position in the work they
want to do. They can't afford to risk bot-
tlenecks and blind alleys in that program,
either.
Big Opportunity
I had this in mind when I graduated from
MIT in 1936 and enrolled in the Allis-
Chalmers Graduate Training Course. I'd
been particularly interested in production
and sales. I was looking for practical train-
ing, experience and opportunity. And I
got them.
First assignment was in Steam Turbine
erection. Then I went to the Centrifugal
Pump Department, and worked on cost
analysis. This job gave me a chance to
study plant layout and manufacturing
methods, and put me in contact with the
Time Study and Planning Department. I
liked the work, and finished up the course
in that department. I've stayed in the same
type of work ever since.
Here in Production Scheduling we pick
up each job after the Planning Depart-
ment has established the routing. It's up
to us to set a shipping date, and then work
out dates when the job is to be completed
in the various shops through which it must
go. This requires a thorough knowledge
of methods, shop capacities and work
loads throughout the entire plant.
Great Diversity of Products
To give some idea of the extent of this
operation, here are a few facts about the
West Allis Works: The floor area of the
buildings is more than 160 acres. There
are 14 miles of railway and 4 miles of roads
within the plant, and the shops contain
more than 30,000 power tools, from small
precision machines to the great 40-foot
boring mill. It requires 208 travelingcranes
to handle materials and equipment. There
are twelve great machine, assembly and
erection shops, three foundries, pattern
shop, tank and plate shop, forge shop,
mill shop and many miscellaneous build-
ings used in manufacturing.


Assembling big direct-current blooming
mill motor for test—last step in the
manufacturing process before shipment
and final installation.
Some of the big jobs going through
now include a 107,000 kw steam turbine
unit for a midwest utility and two com-
plete new hydraulic turbine and generator
units for Hoover Dam. There's an order
for six 22,000 hp pumping motors for a
West Coast irrigation project, and another
for one of the largest power transformers
ever built. Rotary kilns up to 400 ft. in
length, gyratory crushers weighing 500
tons and 22 million volt Betatrons are all
products of these shops. So are delicate
electronic and control devices.
Allis-Chalmers designs and builds basic
machines for every major industry: steam
and hydraulic turbine generators, trans-
formers and other equipment for the
electric power industries; crushers, grind-
ing mills, rotary kilns, screens and other
machines for mining, ore processing, ce-
ment and rock products; flour mills and
oil extraction plants; electronic equip-
ment; big pumps, motors, drives ... to
name just a few.
Widest Choice
As you can see, Graduate Training Course
engineers at A-C can move in just about
any direction they choose—any industry,
any type of work from machine design,
research and product engineering to man-
ufacturing, selling and installation.
The course is set up to allow students
plenty of chance to gain training and ex-
perience in the work they choose. There's
no reason to run into bottlenecks or dead-
end streets—for students help plan their
own courses, and are free to change their
plans as new interests, new opportunities,
present themselves.
Completed parts flow on a planned master
schedule from all parts of the great West
Allis Works as this large turbine unit takes
form. This is a general view of a part of the
vast erection shop.

complished by the metallizing process or
by metal spraying, as it is also known.
This process is the application by spray of
very fine metal particles onto either a
metallic or nonmetallic surface. As the
spraying continues, a coating is built up on
the worn area until the parts become
slightly larger than the required finished
dimension. Machining or grinding is then
required to remove surplus metal and
make the piece accurate and usable again.
It is very important to carefully pre-
pare the surface that is to be sprayed in
order to form a suitable base for the
metal particles. A clean surface is the
first consideration. Oxides, oils or water
which might form a layer between the
part and the sprayed metal, prevent or
lessen adherence. Secondly, the surface

can turn on the second or third diesel-

stops at any time, another automatically
starts and the transmitter sends a series of
pulses that change the red light to flash-

A Coast Guard spokesman reported the
robot lightship was designed to provide
more reliable information to mariners at
low cost. He estimated an annual saving
of $59,000 in salaries and the cost of
food that would be necessary for a crew.
Worn Surfaces Rebuilt

ed from Grits and Grinds.
Since 1933, the restoration or rebuild-
ing of worn parts has been successfully ac-
must be toughened in order that the first
layer of metal can bond itself to the part.
Cleaning and roughening up the sur-
face can be done quickly and easily either
by rough turning or by rough grinding.
Metallizing is done by taking the metal
in wire or powder form, heating it to a
molten state and then propelling the glo-
bules or spheroids onto the work by an air
blast through a nozzle. When these tiny
hot particles of metal strike the work,
they flatten out and cool almost instantly.
As the surface builds up, the flakes are
bonded together to form a solid coating.
An important point to remember is the
elapsed time between preparation and
spraying. The spraying should be done as
soon as possible after the surface has been
ground inasmuch as any oxidation or dirt
that might collect on the surface during
the interim would prevent a strong bond.
The metallizing process produces a sur-
face on the metal very different in physical
and mechanical properties than that of a
cast or forged piece. As has been prev-
iously stated, the small metal droplets are
forced against the work and flattened out.
This forms a layer surface of thousands of
scales. Fori the finishing of a sprayed
metal surface, wet grinding is preferred.
The coolant should be allowed to flow
copiously onto the point of contact of the
wheel and the work.

Refractory Material
Volume production of mullite, a
tough crystalline compound long recog-
nized as an exceptionally durable refrac-
tory material for severe furnace conditions,
was announced by officials of The Babcock
&amp; Wilson Company, manufacturers of
boilers, tubing and refractories. The new
material is principally used in the manu-
facture of B &amp; W ALLMUL firebrick, but
will also be available in the form of grain
and as a ramming mix.
While furnace engineers have long
been aware of the advantages of mullite,
high production costs have limited the
range of application of the practically all-
mullite type of refractory. The significance
of ALLMUL, according to company offi-
cials, is that its economical mass produc-
tion will open the way to wide-spread ap-
plication in a great range of industrial fur-
naces.
"Furnace maintenance bulks large in
the production costs of many industries
such as steel, non-ferrous metals, glass
and ceramics," a company spokes-
man pointed out. "ALLMUL, with its ex-
ceptional durability and economical first
cost, should enable these industries to
achieve substantial savings in many of their
furnaces by reducing both periodic repairs
and lost production time due to shut
down."
The term mullite refers to a chem-
ical composition with the formula
3Al203.2Si02. Rarely found alone in na-
ture, certain amounts of it are formed
when any mixture of alumina and silica
are heated to the proper temperature.
However, unless a correct proportion of
materials is used, the mullite crystals are
small and widely separated. They are em-
bedded in a matrix of silica which will

Chemical Research helped produce


The tires on your car right now may
have cords of Cordura* High Tenac-
ity Rayon yarn. If so, you benefit
from one of the most important con-
tributions that Du Pont scientists
have made through the years to the
automotive industry.
"Cordura" High Tenacity Rayon
is comparable to structural steel in
tensile strength. It makes possible
tires that are at once lighter, stronger
and safer than pre-war tires. Unlike
natural fibers, the qualities of this
product of chemical science are al-
ways uniform.
UNDIES TO TIRES
At first, rayon was used mainly in
making articles of clothing. However,
with an improved tire cord in mind,
Du Pont scientists set out to produce
a tougher rayon than any previously
known. The problem was given to a
skilled team whose members included
organic, physical and analytical
chemists, physicists, and chemical
and mechanical engineers.
One of their first discoveries was
that strength could be increased by
using cotton linters as the source of
cellulose, in place of wood pulp. It
was found, also, that the viscose solu-
tion had to be prepared and handled
with extreme care. Perhaps the most
important lesson was one which the
silkworm had taught centuries be-
fore: stretching increases strength. The
Du Pont experimenters stretched the
new yarn and made rayon with a ten-
sile strength of about 70,000 pounds
to the square inch—more than twice
the strength of textile rayon then
being produced.
TRIED AND PROVED
With the cooperation of tire manu-

V-bells of "Cardura" and rubber keep even
tension, far outlast others.
facturers, "Cordura" was tested in
heavy-duty tires on baking-hot des-
ert roads. During the war it proved
itself on command cars, trucks and
jeeps. Today, rayon-cord tires are
widely used on trucks and buses,
and leading manufacturers use
Du Pont "Cordura" in tires they
make for passenger cars.
The combination of lightness and
strength offered by "Cordura" has
also earned it a welcome from makers

be applied to bridges as well as to airfoils.
Such model tests have shown the very im-
portant role played by the swirling vortices
—von Karman vortices trail— formed in
the air on the lee side of the bridge and
torn away periodically. If these vortices
tear off at a rate corresponding to the vi-
bration time of the bridge itself, they are
able to reinforce its amplitude of oscilla-
tion, similar to the way that the motion of
a child's swing is reinforced by someone

easily predicted and ordinarily far small-

in both materials and manpower, and it
would be foolish to allow in Los Angeles,
for example, where the wind rarely, if
ever, exceeds 56-60 mph, the same margin
as in the Mississippi Valley, where in the
notorious midwestern tornadoes, winds
exceeding 200 mph have frequently raged.
Similarly, the meteorologist would advise
the east coast engineer to allow safety
factors for the 100-150 mph winds observ-

ly to these wind-created vortices as the
means of having started the disastrous
twisting motions.
Finally, the behavior and character of
the wind itself must be studied, and it is
here that the meteorologist can contribute
his services to the problem of bridge engi-
neering. For1 example, it has been shown
by bridge construction experts that the
wind forces on such a structure are drasti-
cally dependent upon the so-called "angle
of attack" at which the wind strikes the
bridge, being doubled or even tripled if
the wind departs by an angle of as little
as 10° from the horizontal. Although
precise meteorological measurements of
wind are notably lacking and could be
made as part of the collaboration of engi-
neer and meteorologist, in such locality the
special features of the terrain would sug-
gest to a person with weather training
what vertical component could normally
be associated with the wind from each di-
rection.
Furthermore, the bridge engineer must
allow for high factors of safety in con-
struction, so that ideally the bridge would
be able to withstand winds many times
the strength of the maximum observed in
the locality. (Safety factors required by

ed in the occasionally rampaging tropical
hurricane (like that devastating New Eng-
land in 1938), while nowhere on our Pa-
cific Coast are hurricanes ever observed,
and a wind of 70 mph is a once-a-lifetime
rarity.
So, while it is true that the engineer
cannot as yet design and build his own
weather (perhaps" it is just as well, since
it is hard to foresee general agreement on
this topic), he can make use to a far
higher extent than the layman of what is
already known about weather processes,
and he can do this in two ways.
First, he can gain an understanding of
the basic physics of the atmosphere; with
his technical training and background in
physics and mathematics, he is in an en-
viable position to do so. Second, he can
learn to make use of existing weather
services; he can learn enough of the lan-
guage of the weatherman to call upon the
vast stores of knowledge and informa-
tion accumulated by the United States
Weather Bureau and the university
meteorology departments.
This has been the twofold purpose of
those of us in the physics department at
Illinois Institute of Technology who have
had the privilege of organizing a course
in meteorology, primarily for some of the
junior and senior engineering students.
We have not attempted to make forecast-
ers of these students. They have not been
required to spend long hours plotting
winds and drawing isobars on multi-col-
ored weather charts. Neither has it been
our goal to make research meteorologists
out of them, nor to enable them to fill
blackboards with the differential equations
of theoretical meteorology. During the
years in which this course has been devel-
oping, the amount of mathematics has
indeed been cut down and the emphasis
on the physical principles increased. The
postgraduate engineer cannot be expected
to recall what the thermal wind equation
is, but he can and should remember that
over North America west winds generally
increase with height and this occurs be-
cause temperatures are higher towards the
South.
It is at this point, with the basic circir-
Iation principle, that the course begins.
The students learn that, in addition to
producing sunrise and sunset, the rotation
of our terrestrial globe is a decisive force
in cyclone, west wind, and the variability
of weather. In fact, if the earth were
standing still, northerly winds would pre-
vail everywhere at the ground except at the
shores of seas, for then the atmosphere
would be circulating as does air in a room
with a radiator at one corner, or like a con-
vection cell with its heat source at the
equator. From this simple convection cell,
it is a long step to the motions of the real
atmosphere flowing turbulently over a
rough, rotating, continent-bespotted globe.
Indeed, these complexities are so vast that
their unravelling is still in its beginning
stages.
Although the art of forecasting goes
back to the omens of the ancients and
the sailors' yarns of "rain before
seven . . .", the science of meteorology is
young. Therefore, it does not seem worth-
while to crowd the mind of the engineer
with the details of new, conflicting, and
still tentative theories. But even though
they cannot yet be fullyex plained, the
large-scale features of atmospheric circu-
lation can be described in ever-increasing
detail. And this description need not be
a dry dissertation on high-and low-pres-
sure areas, clockwise and counter-clock-
wise winds, and the annual rainfall at
Pongo-Pongo, but can be vividly connect-
ed with our own day-to-day experience.

That's why it's such a popular re-

possesses high thermal conductivity
and low electrical conductivity when
hot, it is used extensively in both
fuel and electrically heated furnaces.

Alundum grains in various crystalline

a hardness of 2000, the same as the
sapphire.
As the world's largest manufacturer
of abrasives, Norton has worked
wonders with Alundum grains. High-

men in Norton's laboratories have
succeeded in giving to Alundum
abrasives a wide range of physical
properties by controlling the size of
crystals and their chemical and
physical properties.

The crowning achievement in alumi-

has been hailed as the "greatest
abrasive contribution to increased
grinding production in more than 40
years."

Every Ann Arborite for example, has
his own reaction, however bitter, to the
climate of this metropolis. If asked to de-
scribe it in one word, resisting the tempta-
tion to say "horrible", he would probably
choose "changeable" as the word best suit-
ed. Indeed, the midwesterner is all too
familiar with 70 degree heat followed by
5 degree cold, with June and January and
frost in May. Yet while Ann Arbor al-
ternately roasts and freezes or blows away,
the senores of Porto Rico, day after day,
season after season, almost never see the

are mute witnesses to air currents warmed

The association of the concepts
"weather" and "fickle" is a middle-lati-
tude prejudice, due to the fact that we live
in the battle ground of polar and tropical
masses of air, which are brought together
with much wind and bluster by the travel-
ing storms or "cyclones." (The Novem-
ber 11, 1940 storm of Chicago was an out-
standing and bloody engagement in this
battle.) It is by this continual skirmish-
ing that, in our latitudes, warm air makes
its way northward, and cold air invades
the southland.
In the tropics, on the other hand, the
same transfer of heat can be affected in a
more orderly fashion by ascent near the
equator and descent in the horse-latitudes
(about 30° north and 30° south latitude),
exposed to the curious layman as to the
doctor of philosophy, and in this way, the
engineering student can be introduced to
weather problems.
To supplement this free laboratory of
nature whose experiments are put on be-
fore our eyes all the time, and whose
"data and results" consist of the desert,
the towering thunderhead and the bliz-
zard, a man-made laboratory has recently
been added to Illinois Tech's meteorology
course. By actually swinging a psychro-
meter (wet-and-dry bulb thermometers for
humidity determination), counting the
revolutions of a wind-meter, or locating
air mass boundaries (fronts) on a real
weather chart, the student learns the use
and limitations of the common meteoro-
logical tools. He sees the actual operation
of many of the principles he heard in the
lecture -room. A large section of the lec-
tures, for example, are concerned with the
relation between atmospheric pressure and
height above the ground. This prob-
lem is not only basic to "why the
weather" but is fundamental to aircraft
altimetry, a topic studied at some length.
What could be a better demonstration
of the fact that the pressure decreases
upward than the gradual expansion and
final bursting of the huge balloon that
carries with it the radiosonde trans-
mitter?
What could be a better indication of the
three-dimensional character of our ocean
of air than the radiosonde itself, a small,
two-pound radio, which, ascending to
heights of 50,000 feet and more, sends
back to the ground the temperature and
humidity at intervals right up into the
stratosphere?
Indeed, the changes of wind with
height, the relation between winds and
air pressure, and the turbulent wind struc-
ture in the lowest levels above the airfield
are the meteorological matters of perhaps
the most vital concern to aeronautics. It is
for this reason that at least one-half of the
course is concerned with the many aspects
of the subject "wind."
While the wind can often be made to
serve the aviator, the thunderstorm, freez-
ing rain, sleet, fog, and driving snow are
all his enemies. These hazards to flying,
each leaving in its wake wrecked aircraft,
cancelled and delayed flights, lost time
and money, all arise from the condensation
of gaseous water vapor into liquid water
(or solid ice or snow). The prime mover
in the condensation process is cooling air.
In fact, every cloud, whether low and gray
and pregnant with snow or white and
fluffy, nearly every fog, and every thun-
derhead, is a sign of this cooling, just as
every footprint is a sign that a living crea-
ture has passed.
Yet every cloud does not rain. A gray
day is not synonymous with unbrella-car-
rying. To cause a cloud to fall to the
ground as rain or snow, something must
be added. An additional requirement, that
of "supercooling", must nearly always be
fulfilled. Even the famous "dry-ice" ex-
periment will not produce rain or snow
or anything else unless the cloud so seeded
contains liquid water cooled below 32
degrees Fahrenheit. This principle is

Strength factors of Long Life!
No pipe that is provably deficient in any of these
strength factors should ever be laid in city streets
'ithout crushing strength—or, for that
matter—without all of the strength factors
listed opposite—no pipe laid 100 years
ago in city streets would be in service
today. But, in spite of the evolution of
traffic from horse-drawn vehicles to heavy
trucks and buses—and today's vast
complexity of subway and underground
utility services—cast iron gas and water
mains, laid over a century ago, are
serving in the streets of more than 30
cities in the United States and Canada.
Such service records prove that cast iron

The ability of cast iron pipe to withstand ex-
ternal loads imposed by heavy fill and un-
usual traffic loads is proved by the Ring
Compression Test. Standard 6-inch cast iron
pipe withstands a crushing weight of more
than 14,000 lbs. per foot.
When cast Iron pipe is subjected to beam
stress caused by soil settlement or disturbance
of soil by other utilities, or resting on an ob-
struction, tests prove that standard 6 inch cast
iron pipe in 10-foot span sustains a load of
15.000 lbs.
The toughness of cast iron pipe which enables
it to withstand impact and traffic shocks, as
well as the hazards in handling, is demon-
strated by the Impact Test. While under hydro-
static pressure and the heavy blows from a
SO pound hammer, standard 6-inch cast iron
pipe does not crack until the hammer is
dropped 6 times on the same spot from pro-
gressively increased heights of 6 inches.
In full length bursting tests standard 6-lnch
cast iron pipe withstands more than 2500 lbs.
per square inch internal hydrostatic pressure,
which proves ample ability to resist water-
hammer or unusual working pressures.

THE SIMPLE ANSWER—The illustrations show how one
manufacturer did it—with two S.S.WHITE
FLEXIBLE SHAFTS. One shaft, operated from the
control knob, turns a reel at the base of the
antenna. The other, on the reel, pushes up and
pulls down the antenna sections as the reel is
turned. As S.S.WHITE shafts can be supplied In
any length, this arrange-
ment makes the antenna
adaptable to all types of
cars and other motor
control shaft vehicles.

The short step from transit to pilot-ballroom theodolite is
eagerly made by these students.
frontline investigation of instrumentation, theory, and weather-
forecasting are going on. They help to send up a radiosonde,
and listen at the ground receiver to the putts and hums telling
of cloud and temperature direction aloft. They climb around
the radio-direction finding equipment (called by meteorologists
the "RAWIN"), which, even through rain and overcast, fol-
lows the balloon drifting with high-level winds.
For the student who wrote on his final exam paper, "From
what I have learned here about meteorological problems, I
can easily see why the Weather Bureau is proud of its 85 per
cent forecast record", the purposes of the course have been
achieved to a large degree. Although this student, as a graduate
engineer, will not thereby achieve a record in forecasting, he
will be able to make use of the existing meteorological services.
He will have some knowledge of what information is available
and how to use it in doing his own job. While the weatherman
cannot yet be engineer in his profession, the engineer is more
fortunate, for his opportunities to be weatherwise are unlimited.
If for no other reason than to provide the basis for this type
of fruitful contact and exchange of ideas, the existence of a
basic meteorology course would be justified in every engi-
neering curriculum.

processes a special steel pipe
into a real quality conduit—
Sherarduct.
Special high-grade steel is
Spellerized — a kneading
process that produces fine,
even-textured steel.
The Spellerized steel is
rolled into pipe, put through
the Scale-Free process and
pickled.
This specially treated pipe is
Sherardized —an exclusive
process of galvanizing that
applies zinc to metal under
heat. This affords permanent
protection against rust.
A smooth "Shera-Solution"
enamel is baked into the
pores to give acid-resistant
surfaces.
Then—and only then—do you
have Sherarduct, a true con-

been reading Lester's Marketing Indus-
trial Equipment on his own time, and had
been following current articles along the
same line. Since he wished to locate in
sales engineering, he had listed a valuable
special interest in an up-to-the-minute
way.
9. Preferences. You may hesitate to
mention two or three or four preferences,
fearing that some employer may pass you
up if the opening he has does not quite
fit your desires. Indeed, the fear may be
justified. But you can hardly leave him
completely in the dark; he is quite likely
to do the same to you— which is fair
enough. He does not want to ask you to
come across the state for an interview,
only to find that you don't want his sales
job. On the positive side, if he is looking
for a production man, and you have said
you wanted to be one, you begin to get
together with him right away. Of course,
preferences are to be stated in general,
functional terms. An older man may
properly say he wishes to design fractional
horsepower motors; that is his line, and
has been for years. You will say, as a
recent graduate, that you want design of
small rotating apparatus. And put down
about three preferences, not just one. It
is seldom necessary to state negatives.
However, if you positively will not con-
sider something—such as sales—say so.
10. References. It is customary to
cite as references, one or more of the
men you have already worked for. They
are used to these matters, and will take
it as a matter of course. As a college
man, such reference will not complete
your list. You must not fail to refer to
at least one faculty member. Otherwise,
the employer will assume that for some
reason that ought to be smoked out, you
left college under such a cloud that you
would rather not have your name brought
up on the campus any more than can be
helped. That isn't the case—but what is
he to think? No, you do not need to ask
permission of any faculty member in order
to refer to him. Whether or not you ask
him about it, he will be glad to respond
to inquiries, and he will tell the facts as
he sees them in either case. Now, there
is often good reason for asking him first:
you thus make more certain that he really
will remember you. It lessens the chance
that in a couple of years he will be mis-
taking you for the classmate of about the
same size, weight, and degree of difficulty
in keeping awake in that early afternoon
class.
11. Write your own ticket. It is
by no means intended that when ten
categories are listed above, you will
faithfully have all ten—no more, no less.
Make the job your own. And after read-
ing this, do not get in wrong by trying to
bedevil some poor faculty member into
telling you in detail how to do it. Get to
work and design the record. Type it to
see how it will look. Then, if you wish,
take it to a faculty member and ask for
suggestions.
It is entirely legitimate to get all the
ideas you can from personal records al-
ready available. We have plenty on file
in the E. E. Department.
To close this matter of personal rec-
ords, a striking instance may be cited.
A recent graduate carefully informed him-
self before he left the campus. He shortly
sent me one of the best records I have
ever seen. A few days later he called on
a certain firm in his home city, and hand-
ed a copy to the girl. She cheerfully pass-
ed it in to the chief engineer, and prom-
ised it would receive attention. However,
she told the graduate not to wait. It was
not customary to grant an interview the
same day. He chose to wait anyway. In
five minutes he was called in. He an-
swered three questions and in ten more
minutes was hired. Total elapsed time,
fifteen minutes. He's there yet.
Author's 1940 Addendum . . .
In the spring of 1939, I made a study
of the content of interview and applica-
tion blanks of 21 companies. I have not
seen such a study published anywhere;
this is the first publication of the present
study.
Forty-two items were found that are of
significance in the placement of college
seniors. Omitted are some items that ap-
ply mainly to older men—such as Num-
ber of Children; also omitted are items
of significance only to non-collegiate men.
The table presents (at top) the confi-
dential key numbers of 21 companies,
and (at left) the 42 items. A blank
space means that the company did not in-
clude that item. It is amusing to note
that one of the largest firms in the world
forgot to ask for Height and Weight.

his cronological age since the average
stature of children 96 months old is 50
inches. The single straight line at a 45
degree slope to the ordinate is the average
for all growth ages. This growth age
concept gives us a common system of
units to discuss growth in such diverse
things as mentality, skeleton, teeth,
strength, height, reading, and weight.
These become the growth ages of the
ordinate and are called: mental age
(M.A.), carpal age (Ca.A), dental age
(D.A.), grip age (G.A.), height age
(H.A.), reading age (R.A.), and weight
age (W.A.).
The girl presented in figure one is clas-
sified as a very rapidly growing child.
The general level of growth at 48 months
of age is at or slightly above the average
for girls. By 130 months it will be noted
that adult stature (H.A.-208) has almost
been attained. Her ability to read (R.A.)
is nearly equal to that of the average high
school junior. Her achievement in other
high school subjects is also advanced.
Weight (W.A.), strength (G.A.), and
skeleton development (Ca.A) are distrib-
uted between 168 and 180 growth age
months. General intelligence (M.A.) is
slightly lower. Dental growth (D.A.),
the most conservative measure, lies at 150
months. It is interesting that school
achievement is considerably higher than
mental age alone would predict. This is
characteristic of growth; the achievement
and behavior of the child reflects the total
growth of the organism far more than it
is related to the growth in any individual
measure.
Especially noticeable is the unified way
in which all measures emerge, each sup-
porting the other, so that growth as a
whole is a closely related system. Chil-
dren who develop in this unified fashion
are exceptionally fortunate. Their be-
havior, like their growth, is unified and
consistent. Social learning and psycho-
logical serenity are easy to obtain in chil-
dren of this nature. The pubertal indica-
tors of maturity emerge early; breast de-
velopment (A,' B, and C on the abscissa)
begins at 76 months (A) and is very ad-
vanced by 114 months (C) ; other second-
ary sex characteristics (I, II, and III)
show the same precocity, and the menarche
(M) begins at 102 months.
Children who grow like this are easy
to rear and educate, and mistakes in man-
agement are hard to make effective; the
organism is well designed to absorb the
impacts of poor management and con-
versely responds with vigor to proper
handling.
By way of sharp contrast we present a
slow growing girl in figure two. Here we
see general maturity, as indicated by the
average of all growth ages, emerging
slowly, all physiological evidence indica-
tive of beginning puberty is absent (A)
throughout the extent of the graph (C.A.-
144). The slope of the graph as a whole
is less than the average for girls with ma-
turity, relative to the average, less at 144
months than it is at 60 months of age.
The growth as a whole is moderately uni-
fied. The individual growth age lines are
far more erratic than those presented in
figure one. This internal variability is in-
dicative of a disturbed organism and sug-
gests that greater care be exercised in man-
agement. Children who grow slowly like
this are the recipients of poor and arbi-
trary handling. The average of the popu-
lation becomes the standard for normal
growth. These children then become sub-
normal, exceptional, and peculiar. They
are subject to failure and punishment, to
extra doses of guidance and vitamins, to
remediation of reading, arithmetic and
character, and often glandular therapy in
case none of the other techniques work.

How to improve
a wood hog's appetite
The wood hog shown here chews up logs for paper
pulp like a giant pencil sharpener. As they chip away
at the logs, the revolving cutter knives impose heavy
shock loads on the bearings. To carry these shock
loads, engineers specified that the cutter shaft be
mounted on Timken® tapered roller bearings. Due
to the line contact between the rolls and races,
Timken bearings have extra load carrying capacity
—take the heaviest shock loads.
Here's bow engineers use
TIMKEN® bearings for heavy
shock loads
To give extra support to the wood hog's main shaft,
double-row Timken bearings are used. The tapered
construction of the rolls and races enables Timken
bearings to carry both radial and thrust loads in any
combination. Shafts are held in rigid alignment, end
movement eliminated. Because Timken bearings
permit the use of effective closures, lubricant stays
in and dirt and moisture are kept out.

of a population and conclude normality
or abnormality of an individual is impos-
sible to comprehend. However, the
method one uses to obtain ignorance does
not lessen its danger . Now growth in it-
self is not a liability—it merely needs to
be managed at the rate and in the manner
it emerges The policy is clear. Fit the
nurture to the child, not the child to the
nurture.
The boy, illustrated ,by figure three,
grows rapidly and in a very unified
fashion. The changes in growth rate,
giving rhythm of growth, are marked.
Timing and pacing as a rearing policy
would be: slow down when the child
slows and speed up when the child speeds.
The fact that two brothers grew in almost
identical fashion can be added to other
powerful evidence to warrant the conclu-
sion: the growth of the individual, in
rate, in pattern, and in the opportunities
or liabilities it creates, depends almost
entirely upon heredity. The most effective
way to change the growth of a child is to
change his parentage. Biologically this is
impossible.
The growth curves for the girl shown
in figure four are instructive. This is a
(Continued from page 56)
very unusual picture of growth. The man-
agement problems it provides require
marked skill and understanding in order
that serious damage is avoided. From
96 to 132 months of age, growth as whole
is virtually non-existant. The individual
curves are widely separated and highly
erratic. From 132 to 156 months the rate
is rapid, the growth is coordinated, and
the marked irregularity of the individual
lines disappears. In her early years there
was fear that she might be heading for
dwarfism. Treatment with antuitrin to
compensate for apparent pituitary defi-
ciency and to stimulate growth was insti-
tuted. The organism responded with con-
vulsive behavioral reactions, and built up
antibodies to make the stimulant ineffec-
tive. There is a suspicion that growth was
actually retarded. Certainly it was not
stimulated, and certainly the child was dis-
organized. What little evidence there is
indicated that the upward swing and
greater unity in the curves after 132
months was in spite of the treatment and
not because of it. The effects of other
types of medical treatment cannot be as-
certained.
Irrespective of complex causative and
partners in creating
K &amp; E drafting instruments, equipment and materials
have been partners of leading engineers forgl yean
in shaping the modern world. So extensively are these
products used by successful men, it is self-evident that
K &amp; E has played a part in the completion of nearly
every American engineering project of any magnitude.

the growth age.
Figure five presents the growth of a dis-
organized, slow-learning, maladjusted
boy. We call such children split-growers
or biologically awkward. They comprise
about eight percent of the population.
Individuals who grow in this disorganized
fashion become our delinquents, criminals,
and neurotics when poorly handled. The
use of any forcing procedures is strongly
contraindicated. The use of failure and
punishment becomes particularly danger-
ous. A general directive is to educate the
split grower in terms of his more slowly
emerging parts. This reduces the difficulty
of the problems but does not completely
solve them. Continued close attention to
the maintenance of psychological serenity
of the child is an added requirement.
These figures and accompanying brief
discussion serve to illustrate the diversity
and the individuality of growth. They
point up the dangers involved in the many
and arbitrary uses of a population average
as reasonable adjuncts for rearing chil-
dren. They emphasize the continued need
for a realistic comprehension of the na-
ture and meaning of individual growth as
foundations for skillful practice if our in-
vestment in children is to pay dividends in
adults.

perature as low as 2813° F.. On the other
hand, the ingredients for ALLMUL are so
proportioned as to form a high percentage
of mullite crystals with no free silica. The
small amount of excess material consists
mainly of corundum (crystalline alumina)
which is also noted for its high refractory
properties. The strong, massive structure
of the mullite crystals is produced by using
an electrically fused grog in conjunction
with an unusually high final burning tem-
perature.
Some idea of what this composition and
structure means may be gathered from the
properties of ALLMUL. Its melting point,
for example, is 3335° F. (Ordinary steel
melts in the range of 2370-2550° F.). Its
cold crushing strength is 1.7 tons per
square inch and it shows practically
no deformation when saturated with
heat at 3050° F. and loaded for
iy2 hours at 25 psi. It also pos-
sesses remarkable resistance to thermal
shock (spalling). When heated to 3000°
F. for 24 hours and then alternately heated
to 2550° F. and chilled in an air-water
blast for 12 cycles, ALLMUL shows no

The supersensitive gauge looks like a large

Called an "ion gauge," the new instru-
ment can detect the presence of air in a
vacuum where only one air molecule re-
mains out of every 10,000 billion origin-

this pressure that each one must travel
500 miles before striking another. While
scientists have gone this far in their quest
for a perfect vacuum, until now it has de-

a highly corrosion-resistant outer layer. Result: a lasting
screening, that will nol weather-stain sills or siding. Cost:
no higher than you're used to paying for good screening.
Worth asking for. to install in your present frames, or in new
aluminum-framed combination screen and storm windows.
DISCOVERY WHILE SHAVING.
To a certain Alcoa metallurgist,
the past few weeks' research
seemed futile indeed as he faced
his mirror one morning in the late
twenties. This problem was a
sticker: Army and Navy planes
demanded a new kind of alumi-
num; just as strong, but far more
impervious to salt spray and
weather . . . Suddenly, as he
squeezed the last bit of shaving
cream from the tube, a message
flashed. He wrapped the empty
tube around his finger. Yes ... a
core of strong aircraft alloy . . .
like this. An outer layer of pure,

highly corrosion-resistant alumi-
num . . . like this!
Hastening to the laboratory,
he tried out his new idea. It
worked! Tests proved it to be
everything he hoped it would be.
Then he collared the boss roller
in Alcoa's sheet mill. Quickly, he
explained how this new, more
useful form of aluminum was to
be made. "Can you roll it, Dan?"
the metallurgist asked anxiously.
"Sure we can roll it!" grinned
the big, capable man in overalls.
Soon a sheet ingot of high-strength
alloy, sandwiched between two
thinner slabs of almost pure
aluminum, was slamming through
the shining rolls. It grew wider,
thinner at every pass—a sand-
wich, welded by the tons of pres-
sure into a single unit. Finally,
there emerged a new, protected
kind of aluminum sheet. We
called it "Alclad" Aluminum. And
it came to be a mighty factor in
America's air power. Most mili-
tary and civil planes wear this
strong shining skin.
We learned to make it into
rods and tubing, even to draw it
into fine wire. And thus, among
many other things, a better kind
of screening was born.
BECAUSE FREE COMPETITION demands constant improvement,
Alcoa stockholders backed this metallurgist and his fellow research-
ers, until their perseverance found the answer. Others stood ready,
in plants, sales offices and management, to introduce the new Alclad
products. After 18 years, this better product is still creating new jobs,
and helping America toward better living, in home, farm, and in-
dustry. Seems like a good system for all concerned. Aluminum

ally present in the experimental system.
Now that we are able to achieve and meas-
ure such ultra-low pressures, we can carry
out experiments which have hitherto been
impossible because the particular mole-
cules under study would get lost among
the relatively larger number of air mole-
cules. For example, a better understand-
ing of how gases seep through metals
should follow as the result of this new in-
strument."
"To measure the pressure in a vacuum,
the gauge is sealed tightly to the system,"
Dr. Alpert said. "Then the power is turn-
ed on and electrons from a gun' inside
the* gauge are released, just as in a radio
tube."
"When these electrons collide with air
molecules in their path, they knock off
part of the molecule to create a positively
charged particle called an ion. The num-
ber of ions formed in this way each second
is an accurate measure of the pressure in-
side the vacuum system. We simply read
it from a meter attached to the system.
Previous ion gauges were limited in their
sensitivity because of false readings pro-
duced by x-rays inside the gauge."
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 40)
New Gauge Outdoes Mercury Method
For measuring ordinary low pressures,
Dr. Alpert explained, scientists use a col-
umn of mercury whose height corresponds
to the pressure. At atmospheric pressure,
the height is about 30-in. Using the new
gauge, pressures that would raise a column
of mercury only one-thousandth of a bil-
lionth of an inch can be detected.
The Westinghouse scientist said that the
gauge was developed specifically to aid his
group in studying the behavior of atoms,
electrons, and radiation in gas-filled tubes,
like fluorescent lamps, electronic tubes,
and similar devices. Dr. Alpert added,
however, that it should find widespread
use in other fields.
New Color Filter
The first color filter made commercial-
ly from artificially grown crystals is being
readied for use at the U. S. Naval Observ-
atory to help Naval scientists study sun-
spots and other solar disturbances that af-
fect radio communications.
By filtering out all light except the nar-
row band of red light radiated by incan-
descent hydrogen gas, the new filter will
enable astronomers to study the action of
glowing hydrogen gases which are pre-
dominant on the suns surface.
Developed for the Navy, the new filter
contains birefringent (double-refracting)
plates of "PN" crystals. These are arti-
ficially grown ammonium dihydrogen
phosphate crystals that are also used in
underwater sound transmitters.
The color filter will be installed in a
telescope at the Naval Observatory for use
in making a continuous photographic rec-
ord of the sun's surface activity. It has
been impracticable heretofore to make
such a record with the complicated spec-
troscopic appartus now in use, which per-
mits only a part of the sun's disk to be
seen at one time.
Although sun-spots are sometimes large
enough to be seen with the unaided eye,
prominences—flamelike proturberances off
the edge of the sun—as well as the bright
and dark markings on the solar disk, can
be seen only in the light radiated by the
gases within them. Since the life of these
solar flares is often a matter of minutes,
most of them have escaped observation. A
much larger percentage, however, can be
recorded by continuous photographic film

Glass face that can take a bath of fire
The man you see here can wade into the hot-
test part of a gasoline or oil fire and stay to
put it out.
He is wearing the latest in fire-fighting
dress, developed by the Engineering Divi-
sion Laboratories at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio.
Designing the suit—to protect the wearer
against heat up to 2000° Fahrenheit—was
a tough enough problem for Air Force sci-
entists. But once they had solved this by
using layers of glass fabric, nylon, and metal
foil, the problem presented by the visor for
the fire-fighting suit was yet to be worked
out.
Was there a material transparent enough
to let the fire fighter see, yet fire-resistant
and fire-repellent enough to let him face up
to a 2000° Fahrenheit blaze?
That question was put to Corning Glass
Works, and the answer was a fire fighter's
face made of Coming's Vycor Brand 96%
silica glass.
Two thin panels of 96% silica glass—the
Corning glass that can be heated till it glows
and then plunged into ice water without
breaking—are used to make the visor. And
their inner surfaces are coated with thin,
transparent films of gold.
This glass transmits cool, visible light,
allowing the fire fighter to see. The gold film
blocks the hot, invisible rays by reflecting
them outward. A small dead-air space be-
tween the glass panels prevents conduction
of heat through the glass from the hot,
burning gases.
We hope this special use for Coming's
96% silica glass will remind you that today
—because of Corning research—you can
use glass in many ways that you may never
have thought of before.
Throughout industry, Coming means re-
search in glass—research which has made
glass a material of practically limitless uses.
That's a good thing to remember when
you've finished college and started working.
Then, asyou plan new products or processes,
we invite you to call on Corning before the
blueprint stage. Corning Glass Works, Cor-
ning, New York.

Since soiar flares can affect radio com-
munication by producing fadeouts, and ex-
cessive solar activity can affect telegraphic
and even cable communications on rare
occasions, the prediction of such phenom-
ena is considered a matter of military and
commercial importance.
The new color filter differs from the one
or two others known to exist because its
most critical elements were produced by a
commercial process from artificially grown
crystals. Several years of research were
required by the Baird Associates in learn-
ing how to maintain the necessary optical
tolerances while polishing the delicate
"PN" crystal plates used in the construc-
tion of the filter.
In addition to its use in solar observa-
tions, the new color filter is expected to
have wide application in scientific studies
of elements in other parts of the visual
spectrum. The perfection of techniques
for making birefringent plates for color
filters from commercially-produced crys-
tals will increase the availability of more
efficient instruments for these studies.
The new filter, which has been tested
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 42)
at the Naval Observatory, is one ang-
strom wide (i.e., it will allow only about
one three-thousandths of the visual color
range to pass through it). Ordinary
color filter, similar to those used by ama-
teur photographers, will transmit about
half the color range.
The filter can be "tuned' 'to the light
frequency of glowing hydrogen by turning
a polaroid disk at either end of the filter.
To maintain uniform temperature control
and to protect the delicate plates from the
air, the whole filter plate assembly is con-
tained in an insulated oil-filled cylinder
about 10 inches long and six inches in
diameter.
The Naval Observatory has for some
time been furnishing solar information to
the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory
at the National Bureau of Standrds, the
Naval Research Laboratory, and other
agencies.
Turbosuperchargers
A turbosupercharger which will enable
piston-powered commercial airlines to fly
non-stop from Chicago to London with
heavy payloads has been developed by the
General Electric Company.
The company's Aircraft Gas Turbine
Divisions said that the new turbosuper-
charger makes possible dramatic fuel sav-
ings, together with great power boosts,
when used with piston-powered engines
of the latest design.
E. S. Thompson, manager of sales of the
divisions, described the comparatively
small but powerful turbo—designated the
CH9—as a "significant advance in our
long history of turbosupercharger devel-
opment."
Turbosuperchargers widely used by
America's fighting planes in World War
II, are the devices which enable airplane
piston engines to "breathe" in the rarefied
air of high altitudes. Spun by the engine's
exhaust, they compress the rarefied air to
sea level pressures before it enters the
cylinders.
Thomson said the CH9 has undergone
rigorous test stand operation in combina-
tion with a Pratt and Whitney R-4360-C
piston engine. Tests have shown 32 per
cent more takeoff power, and a reduction
of more than 20 per cent in fuel consump-

we ever
run out of gas?
Running out of the crude oil that
powers and lubricates our civilization
is not an immediate danger. Scientific
methods of exploration, drilling, and
recovery keep pushing farther and
farther into the future the day when
petroleum must be supplemented by
other raw materials. When that day
comes, however, there is no danger
that the American economy will slow
down.
Standard Oil already knows how to
make high-quality gasoline from coal
or oil shale. The supply of these raw
materials is far greater than the re-
serves of petroleum. It is important
that the research and development
work in the entire field of synthetic
fuels continue so as to lower the cost
and raise quality still higher.
Work with synthetic fuels is only
one example of how Standard Oil
plans ahead to serve its customers.
By working to keep this company in
the forefront of one of America's most
competitive industries, our research-
ers and engineers are helping to keep
America itself ahead and to make life
better for every American.

compared with transport powerplants now
in use. The comparison was made with
the performance of a powerplant consist-
ing of a current production turbosuper-
charger, a BH-4, and a production R-4360
engine.
"This means that a powerplant of the
new type can fly an airplane over longer
distances, at greater speeds and with
heavier payloads than any commercial
power plant in service today," Thompson
commented.
General Electric engineers said the CH9
turbo supplies the engine with the highest
airflow—350 pounds a minute—and
under greater pressure—more than six
times atmospheric—than any turbosuper-
charger yet developed.
The engineers said this has resulted
from aerodynamic design improvements in
the turrbo and advanced engine designs
which permit operation of the turbosuper-
charger under higher exhaust pressures
than previously possible.
The new turbosupercharger entirely
eliminates the conventional geared super-

charger, or the impeller, operating off the
engine shaft. There are no mechanical
connections between engine and turbo.
Development of a direct cylinder fuel in-
jection system for the R-4360 eliminated
the major need for a geared supercharger
which is used to insure uniform fuel dis-
tribution to the cylinders. Engineers said
elimination of the geared supercharger not
only saves up to 500 hp, previously drawn
from the piston engine, but also makes
possible a more efficient method of cooling
the combustion air going to the cylinders.
Thompson said airliners equipped with
such powerplants could fly non-stop from
Chicago to London, a distance of 4000
miles, carrying nearly half as many pas-
sengers as are now loaded for Chicago to
New York flights. Commercial transports
are unable to make such flights at present.
Neither can they fly non-stop from New
York to London with profitable payloads.
Engineers said that with the new power-
plants non-stop trans-Atlantic flights
could be made at faster speeds and with
heavier payloads than is now possible by
airliners making two stops enroute.

The "Mid-Century Mark of Progress"
will present the color TV demonstration
in a series of 15-minute shows on the main
floor of the Palace, starting at half-hour
intervals each day of the show.
The new color television unit, to be

Of Engine Students and Mili-
tary Service
A close friend of ours, a senior
in aeronautical engineering here
at the university, a veteran, and
an Air Force reservist, was re-
called to active duty during the
summer vacation. He was order-
ed to report for duty early in
September, which meant that his
last year in college, like his first,
would be "somewhat delayed."
He requested deferment on the
basis of being an engineering
student, and — happily — was
granted a deferment.
If his deferment was an iso-
lated case (many reservists are
asking for deferment for one rea-
son or another; few are being
granted), then we congratulate
our friend on his good fortune.
But if the Department of De-
fense has established the policy
of deferring reservists, as well as
draftees, who are college stu-
dents, then we congratulate that
department on what we believe
to be a wise policy. For the
gentle art of mass murder has be-
come woefully technological, and
the engineer is now the darling of
the generals. In short; they need
us, they need plenty of us, and
they need us badly. The present
UN police action in Korea is
distinguished by hand-to-hand,
pistol-and-trench-knife, tooth-
and-nail fighting, with not a guid-
ed missile to be seen anywhere.
BUT. There is still danger that
other nations, nations more high-
ly industrialized, will fight some-
time in the future. And I do
mean us.
And that, fellow engine stu-
dents, is where vve come in. No
need to go into detail regarding
our role in a future conflict, every
airplane, every radar set, every
ship must have two engineers—
one to build it, and one to oper-
ate and maintain it.
Medical students were deferred
from war service last time; per-
haps engineering students should
be allowed to achieve their de-
grees before going into uniform.
This will, of course, result in a
rush of enrollment in the na-
tion's engineering colleges. How-
ever, is there a formula for weed-
ing out from the applicants those
who choose an engineering edu-
cation only as a shield against
war service? If there is such a
formula, we're not aware of it.
* * *
Another friend of ours, this
one a (ugh) law student was also
called up to active duty, but he
wasn't granted even a few weeks
in order to take his bar examina-
tion.
Oh well, there were too many
guardhouse lawyers in the last
war, anyway.
The Lawyers Can Read?
We welcome to the family of
campus publications the new law
school newspaper. We must ad-
mit astonishment at hearing that
their periodical is, of all things, a
newspaper. We thought surely
it was to be a comic magazine.
Well now, if they can wade
through a newspaper, perhaps
they use those prodigious tomes
for purposes other than door-
stops and body-ballast on windy
days. (Love those titles—Cases
on Torts, Torts on Cases . . .)
We hear tell the name of the
paper is to be Res Gestae (or
something), but as one good
friend to another, may we cordial-
ly suggest the name, The Legal
Eagle. Happy Landings, you am-
bulance-chasers, you. Remember
to be good lawyers, and never
use two words where five will
do. If you run out of paper clips,
come up and see us.

YEARS
of General Electric Research

Industrial research be-
gan in 1900 in G-E lab-
oratory set up in barn
behind home of Charles
P. Steinmetz.
fc**

When the General Electric Research Laboratory was
established in 1900, it was the first industrial laboratory
devoted to fundamental research.
At that time E. W. Rice, Jr., then vice president of Gen-
eral Electric, said:
ilthough our engineers have always been liberally supplied
with every facility for the development of new and original
designs and improvements of existing standards, it has been
deemed wise during the past year to establish a laboratory to be
devoted exclusively to original research. It is hoped by this means
that many profitable fields may be discovered.
Many profitable fields were discovered—profitable not only for
General Electric but also for industry, the American public, and
the world.
A half century ago the industrial experimental laboratory was
itself an experiment. This month it begins its second half century
with the dedication of a new building, greatly augmenting the
facilities it offers to the advancement of man's knowledge.

"I WANT!"

THE STORY OF OIL
Colonel Edwin Drake's oil well, drilled in 1859,
produced only 20 barrels daily . . .
But it gave people a taste of the benefits of petro-
leum—and a great industry was off to a flying start!
The first drilling rigs—first refining equipment-
were adequate for that early demand.
But invention of the automobile, airplane, Diesel
engine and other great machines in turn demanded
great invention in oil—and old-fashioned equipment
gave way to scientific research laboratories, modern
refineries, pipelines, tankers and tank cars.
Each year demand made them bigger and better!
Today, thousands of oil companies with oil fields,
refineries, bulk plants, service stations and cost-
cutting transportation systems—deliver over 1,840,-
000,000 barrels of petroleum yearly—meet U.S.A.'s
demands for value in oil.
And, today, the responsibilities of Socony-Vacuum,
one of the oldest companies in the industry, are con-
stantly mounting . . .
Unprecedented demand for petroleum products
calls for expansion in every phase of our efficient,
coordinated operation . . .
46,400 independent "small" businessmen must be
kept competitive—supplied with what it takes to
provide a big money's worth for you—a good living
for themselves.
When 150,000,000 Americans say, "I want," it takes
businesses of all sizes to deliver!

Because Du Pont is a chemical
company, you might expect most
of its technical men to be chemists.
Actually, there are more engineers
than chemists at Du Pont. In each of
the ten manufacturing departments
there is important work for men
trained in chemical, mechanical,
electrical, metallurgical and other
branches of engineering.
These departments operate much
as independent units with their own
research, development, production
and sales staffs. In their respective
fields, they do fundamental and ap-
plied research on both processes and
products. Sometimes engineers par-
ticipate in the early stages of a proj-
ect. More often, however, they enter
the picture when the project has
moved to the point where commer-
cial production is considered. They
see it through the pilot plant and
semi-works stages and assemble data
necessary for the full-scale plant.
Even after manufacturing has be-
gun, development work is continued
to standardize and improve the proc-
ess. Normally, engineers whose main
interest is production and plant op-
eration take over when the works
stage is reached.
Engineers on the technical sales
staffs help maintain contact between
Du Pont and its customers. They
present data on new products and
guide customers in process develop-
ment and similar problems. They
also use their technical knowledge in
making surveys of possible markets
for the Company's products.
In addition to the manufacturing
groups, the Du Pont Engineering
Department—a central staff organi-
zation—requires engineers with many
types of training. This Department
carries on its own program of funda-
mental and applied research. It also
makes site investigations, lays out
and designs new plants and labora-
tories for the manufacturing depart-
ments. It serves them in research on
process development, on material*
of construction and on methods of
measurement and control.
Yes, engineers figure importantly
at Du Pont. Through their teamwork
with chemists, physicists and other
trained personnel, the Du Pont Com-
pany produces its "Better Things for

R. P. KROON
Engineering Mgr., A.G.T. Div., Westinghouse Corp.
From the Wright brothers' first flight
in 1903 until 1945, the power plant limit-
ed aircraft performance. Although steady
advances increased available power and
reduced engine weight, the huge bulk and
limited maximum power of the piston en-
gine blocked hopes of attaining the truly
high flight speeds that the aerodynamics of
the airframe would permit. But in less
than a decade, the turbojet engine has
broken through these limitations and
made possible great advances in aircraft
performance.
Early evaluation of the turbojet aviation
gas turbine showed that it would be a
light power plant particularly adaptable
for operation at high speeds and high alti-
tudes. It promised almost limitless power.
The turbojet is fulfilling these early
promises.
Jet-propelled aircraft of many types
have flown at altitudes above 50,000 feet
in routine flights. Turbojet engines have
propelled the Douglas "Skyrocket" at su-
personic speeds. At these high speeds the
power of the larger jet engines is already
more than five times that of the largest
piston-engine propeller drives. The in-
stalled weight of the jet engine, on the
average, is less than one quarter that of a
piston engine of comparable power at
high speed. The procession of new mili-
tary aircraft testifies to the enthusiasm of
the plane designer in being freed of prev-
ious power-plant limitations.
However, much remains to be done in
developing and perfecting the several
forms of aviation gas turbines, in both the
military and commercial fields. Engine re-
quirements are increasing to permit flight
at ever higher altitudes and operation
through wider variations in air tempera-
ture. Providing additional services to the
aircraft, such as compressor airbleed for
cabin supercharging or de-icing, and in-
creased power for electrical or hydraulic
accessories, makes ever greater demands
on the engine. The present evolution and
the foreseeable future promise extremely
active development with continuing de-
mands for power plants of increased out-
put, better performance, improved relia-
bility, and greater durability.
In evaluating engine performance, note
what is happening to the most important
engine characteristics—efficiency, weight,
and thrust per unit frontal area. The
performance of more recent engines
is even better, but this data has not yet
been made public.
Fuel Consumption
Improved engine efficiency means that,
with a given amount of fuel, the range of
the aircraft can be increased. Conversely,
with less fuel the aircraft's payload can be
raised without sacrificing range. In 500
hours of operation a jet engine consumes
an amount of gasoline that costs half as
much as the engine itself. Fuel economy,
therefore, is an important economic fac-
tor, even independent of the longer range
or higher payload it makes possible.
High fuel consumption appeared as one
of the weakest traits of. the turbojet en-
gine, but continuing progress is achieving
better fuel economy. While specific fuel
consumption for a typical 1944 engine
was around 1.25 lb. fuel per hr. per lb.
thrust (static, sea level), the engines now
in production average about 1.05, and
further improvement is coming. These
improvements are due to many component
refinements, as well as to a general in-
crease in compressor pressure ratio (ratio
of compressor exhaust to inlet pressures).
Thermodynamic calculations show that,
with reasonable component efficiencies, in-
creasing the pressure ratio from 4 to 6 cuts
down fuel consumption by about 4 per-
cent. Increasing the pressure ratio to 15
saves another 12 percent of fuel, accom-
plished, of course, at additional cost and
weight of compressor. Hence, we can ex-
pect to see engines with higher pressure
ratios where fuel consumption is im-
portant—in long-distance flying. Further
development might well reduce turbojet
fuel consumption to 0.7 lb. fuel per hr.
per lb. thrust (static, sea level) within the
next decade.
The trend to lower fuel consumption
has been more pronounced for axial-flow
engines than for the centrifugal type.
One reason is that the centrifugal com-
pressor, when first applied to the aviation
gas turbine, had reached a higher degree
of perfection than the axial-flow type.
The axial compressor, although suc-
cessfully applied for land use with high
efficiency but with a large number of
stages, is still undergoing continuous im-
provements in performance—particularly
increased pressure ratios with high effi-
ciency.
Present engines operate at turbine inlet
temperatures of about 1500 degrees F.
A higher inlet temperature improves ther-
mal efficiency and iucreases power output,
but, in the turbojet, higher temperatures
also mean poorer fuel economy. More
fuel is used because higher operating tem-
peratures give a higher jet velocity and,
therefore, a lower propulsive efficiency.
This, at all but extremely high speeds,
more than offsets the improved thermal
efficiency of the power plant. Hence, bet-
ter turbojet fuel economy must come from
other improvements in the gas-turbine
cycle.
From the standpoint of non-aviation
gas turbines, it is interesting to note that
present "simple open-cycle" turbojet en-
gines have thermal efficiencies in the
neighborhood of 25 percent, i.e., com-
parable to those of a modern marine
power plant. Increased turbojet efficiency
has already led to the use of this engine
for long-range planes, bombers as well as
transports, that were not envisaged even a

Engine Weight
For a given aircraft, lighter engines per-
mit longer range or higher payload. A
typical specific weight for 1944 engines
was 0.55 lb. per lb. thrust, but present
production engines average nearer 0.40
lb. per lb. thrust. Although many ac-
tive developments favor weight reduc-
tion, there are several tendencies towards
heavier engines.
A higher compression ratio, for better
efficiency, requires more horsepower for
the compressor, and hence more power
from the turbine to drive the compressor.
This additional power results in increased
weight for both components. For those
elements in which the gas pressure gov-
erns the thickness of the structural ele-
ments, higher internal pressure means
heavier walls.
The effect of higher flight speed also

The phenomsnon of generation of an
electric current in a solution by the contact
of two dissimilar metals was not discov-
ered until the early part of the nineteenth
century. This discovery is attributed to
two Italian scientists—Galvani and Volta.
Today's batteries are, however, far dif-
ferent from the crude devices of the pio-
neer experimenters. Since batteries are
commonly used in engineering practice
today, the engineer may wish to know why
certain materials are used in modern bat-
teries.
Battery cells are divided into two
classes, primary and secondary. Primary
cells are those which may not be conven-
iently recharged after discharge and are
ordinarily thrown away—flashlight cells,
for example. Auto batteries are examples
of the use of secondary cells. These may
be restored to usefulness by recharging
when they become exhausted. This dis-
cussion will be limited to the latter type.

They are, with the exception of certain
radio and illumination applications, the
most important, engineering-wise.
The theoretical basis for the battery
may be found in nearly any chemistry lec-
ture room—the familiar Table of Elec-
trode Potential of Metals. (See Table 1)
This table indicates the potential difference
between an electrode of any given metal
and a standard hydrogen electrode. Those
metals which are above hydrogen in the
table are more chemically active and will
replace hydrogen from solution. This in-
dicates that these elements would be de-
sirable for a negative plate in a cell. Some
confusion arises in naming the plates, but
•the convention here is that the plate at
which oxidation of the electrode occurs
during discharge is called negative. That
this is consistent with electrical practice
may be seen from the following reaction
where the typical element G is oxidized:
G° -► G»+ + ne.
The electrons will flow away from the
"G" electrode to the other electrode.
Since conventional current flow is the re-
verse of electron flow, or from positive to
negative, the "G" electrode will be nega-
tive.
Without other considerations, it would
seem that the best cathode material would
be lithium because of its high potential
difference with respect to hydrogen. The
only practical difficulty in using lithium is
that the cathode is in contact with the
electrolyte. No practical electrolyte has yet
been developed which will not react with
lithium and not cause it to be entirely
used up in a few minutes. This same ob-
jection holds for the first nine of the list-
ed metals although lithium is the extreme
case. Some special batteries for very spec-
ial conditions have been made with ca-
thodes of certain of the metals in this
group, but for general use they are im-
practical.
Switching to the other end of the table,
we find that the metals with positive po-
tential are too inactive chemically to re-
act with hydrogen. That is they require
power to react rather than offer power in
reaction, so they are eliminated from con-
sideration as cathodes. This leaves us
with the ten middle-of-the-table elements.
Other Requirements
Of course, voltage is only part of the
story of power—high voltage without am-
perage is like a big check but an over-
drawn account. Consequently it is of im-
portance to know also the current which
a unit mass of metal can produce at its
voltage. The values for the voltage, am-
pere hours, and watt hours have been
tabulated in Table 2. We see that man-
ganese has the best theoretical output,
while lead has the least.
Table 2
Electrochemical Properties of Metals
Metal Voltage AH/Ib. WH/lb.
Manganese —1.1 442 486
Zinc —0.758 372 282
Chromium —0.6 468 280
Iron —0.44 435 192
Cobalt —0.29 412 120
Nickel —0.22 414 91
Cadmium —0.357 216 77
Tin -0.13 205 27
Lead —0.12 117 14
The power output in use will be the
theoretical capacity minus the internal loss
in the electrode when current is flowing.
Since this loss in any conductor is its PR
loss, a conductor of low resistivity is very
desirable.
If the battery is to be made for wide
commercial use its cost must be as low
as possible.
These three requirements—voltage,
power output, and cost—will limit the
field of eligibility rather severely. Cobalt,
tin, and cadmium are all scarce and ex-
pensive. The much-touted cadmium-nickel
battery, for example, would cost approxi-
mately $125 and is presently guaranteed
for only four years service, Lead, man-
ganese, zinc, chromium, iron, and nickel,
however, are reasonably available.
It is necessary that the electrolyte in
a practical cell be either an acid or a base
in order to furnish the proper ions to re-
act with the electrode in order to furnish
the proper ions to react with the elec-
trodes to produce current. Of the elec-
trodes listed above, only lead does not
react spontaneously with acids and hence
the only possible acid electrolyte cathode
is lead. To date, only iron has been suc-
cessfully employed in an alkaline cell,
despite considerable investigation in an
effort to get a better alkaline cathode than
iron. We then have only lead cathode-
acid electrolyte and iron cathode-alkaline
electrolyte cells feasible at present.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


SPECIALIST versus GENERALIST

Engineers as Executives. A survey made by the American
Institute of Management brings to light some interesting facts.
Data was collected concerning the presidents of 159 "excellent-
ly managed" companies in 74 industries. From this data it is
shown that the top man:
"Spends his entire business life with the company or within
the industry."
"Takes 28 years to get from the bottom to the top."
"Makes the grade as company president before he is 49."
The first jobs of these presidents indicated the original
occupation from which they came. "The greatest number, 27
started as engineers; 24 as office workers; 21 as machinists
and laborers; 21 as salesmen; 19 as lawyers."
Presidents and other major executives usually spend the
major portion of their lives with the companies they head.
There is not a great deal of switching from one company to
another.
The Engineer Generalist. The engineer who arrives at the
top administratively generally does so at the expense of a
professional reputation in his field. A mechanical or civil en-
gineer at the head of a railroad is a "railroader." He is in the
transportation business. Engineering is literally the foundation
on which the business is built. Nevertheless, an engineer who
becomes a general officer slips out of engineering and hence
leaves his professional specialty.
The same situation exists when an electrical or mechanical
engineer assumes an administrative post with a public utility
or a manufacturing concern. Here again, especially in the case
of the public utility, the business is founded on engineering
and it is advantageous for the administrators to have been
trained and experienced in engineering. When they take over
responsibility for supervision of the entire business the pursuit
of engineering, except in a general way, must cease.
The Engineer Specialist. The word specialization may need
defining. Some people will say that a mechanical or electrical
or a civil engineer is specialized and that a non-specialized
individual would be one who was familiar with all fields of
engineering. Even those who have only a passing acquaintance
with the profession know that it is not possible for an engineer
to be even moderately proficient in all branches. To specialize,
as defined in the dictionary, is "to restrict oneself to a special
branch or field of activity within one's profession or business."
Thus, one might be a specialist in the structural sub-division
of the civil engineering field, in communication in electrical
engineering or in heating and ventilating in mechanical engi-
neering. Indeed, one might confine his attention to still nar-
rower boundaries and pick a specialty within one of those
specialties mentioned.
DEAN IVAN C. CRAWFORD
College of Engineering
University of Michigan
The administrative official who has to do with engineering
subjects must be a generalist rather than a specialist. The prac-
ticing engineer must of necessity develop one or more special-
ties rather than try to cover the entire field of his branch of
engineering. A consulting firm may confine its activities to
foundations, to power generation, sanitary installations, ap-
praisals and evaluations, plant layouts,—to any one or all of
these fields. If several specialties are covered by the firm, it
will be necessary to have experts in these various specialties
either as members of the firm or as employees. Years of ex-
perience plus knowledge of theory will bring to these special-
ists recognition and this will be reflected on the firm.
Disadvantages of Specialization. In the mind of the public,
or at least in some minds, specialists, especially those in engi-
neering and science, are criticized on the ground that they
have little or no interest in the general affairs that are the con-
cern of the public, such as the school system, community activi-
ties, etc. In all probability, this accusation, so far as engineers
are concerned, does not bear up under investigation. However,
it must be admitted that, generally speaking, the engineer and
the scientist have no desire to go into politics and do not
regard this occupation highly.
The greatest evil inherent in specialization from the view-
point of the engineer, and particularly the young engineer, is
the manner in which it limits his boundaries and, consequently,
his early opportunities. Certainly, during his undergraduate
days the student should not attempt to specialize to any con-
siderable degree because he is not in a position to know exactly
what niche in the broad field he is going to fill. In graduate
work and in the practice of his profession specialization will
come to many; while to others there will come a generalization
and a passing into other fields more or less intimately con-
nected with engineering.
Shall We, or Shan't We? Practically all engineers will
specialize to a greater or less extent early in their professional
careers. Many will continue this intensive cultivation of nar-
row field. The young engineer thus has several years in which
to study the problem and gain experience before coming to a
decision. Changes may be made after the initial choice.
From the ranks of the specialists come those who will de-
sign and erect the great structures and machines; design, install
and operate the new processes; and harness the powers of na-
ture so that space and time are compressed. Through their
efforts the art and science of engineering progresses from year
to year. They constitute the engineering profession from the
technical viewpoint.

ANDREW BORYSKO, '51E
Steel was first used in bridge building
in the form of chain cables fashioned of
flat earbars made of open hearth steel.
Less than a century was required to bring
about the evolution of the modern steel
cable suspension bridge. During this
period engineers struggled with the de-
sign problems of this type of bridge and
with each successive bridge brought forth
a more efficient design in spite of the fact
that they worked without the benefit of
any theory of suspension bridge analysis
which did not appear until after the
Brooklyn Bridge had been built.
The Niagara Bridge
One of the bridges built during this
period was a structure called the Niagara
Suspension Bridge, designed and super-
vised by John Roebling as his first try at
a real bridge. He previously built a series
of successful cable-suspended aqueducts
in the eastern part of the United States.
Roebling's bridge, heralded as the
world's first railway suspension bridge,
spanned the Niagara River gorge just be-
low the falls at a town later named Sus-
pension Bridge, New York. From tower
to tower it was 821 feet long and rose 245
feet above the rapids. It was suspended
from four cables resting on limestone
masonry. Each cable had 3,460 ungal-
vanized wrought iron wires. The suspend-
ed structure, of wood, consisted of an
upper deck for railroad tracks and a lower
deck for foot and carriage travel. The two
flat decks were unarched because of the
necessity for a level railroad bed. They
were connected by posts and braced by
diagonal rods, forming a rigid truss.
The bridge was completed in 1855 and
for forty-two years thereafter carried traf-
fic of progressively increasing weight.
This increased in time to iy2 times the
original design loading. In 1896 the
bridge was replaced by an arch type steel
span of more modern proportions be-
cause of the ever-increasing railroad
freight loadings.
Undoubtedly this span had maintenance
troubles not all due to the relatively heavy
schedule of New York Central and the
Great Western Railroad train crossings.
The supporting cables, made of ungal-
vanized wire, were among the first built
by Roebling. The rest of the structure-
was an admixture of timber, iron and
Andrew Borysko is a junior in civil engi-
neering at the U. of M. majoring in rail-
road engineering. He is presently on a
leave of absence from the Board of Trans-
portation of New York City, where he
worked as inspector of mechanical equip-
ment on subway trains. He has also
worked for Sperry Gyroscope Co. in ad-
dition to serving nearly five years as a
radio communications man in the army.

son College to take advantage of the

masonry. It is therefore understandable
that curiosity might be aroused as to the
actual effect of traffic and the elements
on this bridge.
A search through some literature on the
subject reveals that during its lifetime the
bridge had to be rebuilt only once. An-
other search unearths the rebuilding engi-
neer's report, entitled "Report on the Re-
newal of Niagara Suspension Bridge" by
Leffert L. Buck, Civil Engineer—1880.
Buck's Report
The object of Mr. Bucks report was to
show the real condition of the cables and
anchorages, and also to indicate how he
had improved them as well as improving
other parts of the bridge. About the time
of Mr Buck's report, much doubt had
been cast as to the safety of the bridge.
The timber structure had reached a state
of dilapidation. Flexing of the structure
under heavy train loads had overstrained
certain joints, allowing moisture to soak
into timber members with resultant exten-
sive decay. Auxiliary chords were intro-
duced to keep up the strength.
Three years before Buck began this job,
a curious engineer dug through the ma-
sonry covering of one of the cables at a
point where it was connected to an an-
chorage chain. He discovered the outer
layer of wire corroded completely away.
Inspection tours followed, resulting in
removal of all masonry covering the
cables. This masonry was supposed to
protect the cables from the weather. Buck
was among those inspecting the bridge
and assisted in repairing defective wires.
These wires were removed and replaced
with new lengths spliced in under strain.
Following the repair work on the
cables, a commission of engineers was
formed which made a very thorough ex-
amination of the entire bridge. One of
the things learned was that the anchor
chains, consisting of numerous bars of
iron 7 inches by 1% inches, needed rein-
forcement. It was definitely shown that,
while each of the cables possessed an ulti-
mate strength of 6,000,000 pounds, an
anchor chain was on!y capable of sustain-
ing 3,465,000 pounds! Many elongated
holes and bent pins were found in these
chains.
Rebuilding the Bridge
The commission issued a report accom-
panied by plans for the complete renova-
tion and reinforcement of the bridge.
Leffert S. Buck was selected as engineer in
charge of this work.
Buck reinforced the chains with addi-
tional bars after testing all bars to accer-
tain their proper elongation when stressed
the equivalent of their permanent load.
Thus the bars were placed in position with
proper elongation brought about by heat-
ing the bars. Buck also sank additional
anchorage pits into the rock formations at
either end of the bridge improving the
positioning of the cast iron anchor plates.
After the new chains were adjusted,
masonry was rebuilt about them and
and grounded firmly. But the ends of the
cables were left untouched, except for
painting, and then enclosed in small brick
houses.
The two towers were in excellent con-
dition having lost very little from their
surface due to weather. Buck calculated
that on the basis of a safety factor of 10,
the towers could lost an additional 1 foot
4 inches on all four sides and still be
considered safe.
Many tests were run off on the rebuilt
bridge which now had a safety factor of
4.4. Test loads were usually a switch en-
gine pulling 20 loaded freight cars. Buck
showed in his report that whereas previ-
ous undulations were of the order of 2
foot in 500 inches, the steel structure re-
duced same to 1 foot in 500 inches. The
narrower steel members also reduced the
resistance caused by high winds. Buck
also cited other advantages of the new
methods used. Eventually traffic condi-
tions reached the point, however, where
the renewed structure could no longer
serve its purpose and had to be replaced.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


During the past decade two situations
have combined to make the fields of
manufacturing and production of increas-
ing interest to engineering graduates.
First, the post-war competitive situation
has put new emphasis on efficient manu-
facturing practices with the objective of
producing more and better goods at less
cost. Second, the large number of engi-
neering graduates have, to a certain extent,
exceeded the demand for engineers in
design and developmental work. Coupled
with this latter reason is the fact that of
this larger group of engineering gradu-
ates, a big proportion are interested more
in industrial engineering than design and
developmental work.
Regardless of the reasons for it, the in-
creased post-war emphasis on the improve-
ment of manufacturing practices has had
the effect of greatly enlarging the num-
ber of job opportunities for engineering
graduates. Ihe technical graduate who
is interested in manufacturing work, usual-
ly has two questions:
1. What qualifications and capabilities
should I have?
2. What are the ultimate opportunities
in this work?
The Qualifications
The requisite qualifications can be di-
vided into two general classes; technical
training and education, and personal qual-
ifications. A successful manufacturing
man must have the proper balance be-
tween these two general classifications of
qualifications.
In regard to technical qualifications, it
is certainly desirable that a man has suc-
cessfully completed a typical industrial en-
gineering curricula. All of these courses
obviously relate to typical manufac-
turing procedures and problems. While
it is desirable that a man has ma-
jored in industrial engineering, industry
today is filled with many competent and
successful executives whose background is
in the more specialized field of mechanical
engineering, electrical engineering, etc.
Whether a man be an industrial engi-
neer or, for example, an electrical engi-
neer, the important consideration is that
he has received some technical or engi-
neering training together with the intel-
lectual benefits that such scientific train-
ing carries with it.
BY
THOMAS B. GREENMAN
Personal Qualities
The personal qualities required of a
manufacturing man are somewhat more
difficult to enumerate. Generally, how-
ever, they fall into three categories:
1. A sincere, genuine interest in manu-
facturing work.
2. An interest in being with and work-
ing with people.
3. The possession of potential or actual
leadership qualities.
The genuine interest in manufacturing
There are many professions and occu-
pations in which a man must enjoy being
with and working with people. But this
characteristic is of lesser importance in
creative design work than it is in, for ex-
ample, sales work. In manufacturing
work, it must be present almost to the
same degree as it should be in sales work,
for this major reason: everything done in
an industrial organization must be done
through other people.. For example, a fac-
tory superintendent or an inventory con-

work is difficult to develop in advance of
ever having done such work. However,
the technical man who does have this
latent interest during his undergraduate
days can, through his own initiative, both
see and learn more about manufacturing
and production work. This can be done
by visiting industrial plants and by talk-
ing with persons engaged in that type
of work. By such means, the engineering
undergraduate can develop his latent in-
terest into a more active interest in manu-
facturing.
trol supervisor performs no direct labor
in the ordinary sense; they plan the work
of others, supervise the work of others,
and through active leadership, they stimu-
late or energize the activities of others.
This constant contact with others requires
a depth of understanding about what mo-
tivates people, an ability to deal with both
the ordinarily co-operative persons and the
difficult unco-operative type; and a sin-
cere liking and interest in people regard-
less of their moods or personalities.

Radiation Counter
The "big three" of radio-active particles
—alpha, beta, and gamma radiations—can
be detected and counted with high preci-
sion by a new instrument developed by
General Electric Company engineers.
"Big three" particles are given off by
such radioactive substances as uranium
and radium, engineers said.
The new instrument, developed in the
G-E General Engineering and Consulting
Laboratory in Schenectady, N.Y., is call-
ed the "universal scintillation counter.'
It is designed for use in testing laboratory
benches, floors, and equipment in radia-
tion laboratories for radioactive contamin-

ation, in measuring radiation of ore
samples, and in determining how fast
radioactive substances disintegrate.
It can also be used in medicine and
biology to detect presence of radioactive
"tracers," atoms tagged with radioactivity
so their movements can be traced, engi-
neers said.
When laboratory bench tops, for in-
stance, are tested for chance radioactivity,
a "smear" of the bench is made by rub-
bing a square of special paper across its
surface. The smear is placed in the sampl-
ing chamber of the scintillation counter
and checked for presence and amount of
alpha, beta, or gamma rays. The chamber
can accommodate samples up to two
inches in diameter, it was said.
When a sample is placed in the instru-
ment's counting chamber, radioactive par-
ticles strike a phosphor, a substance which
gives off light in presence of radioactivity.
These scintillations of light then act upon
an electronic tube called a photomultiplier
tube, which converts the light into electri-
cal energy. A counting circuit is then ac-
tivated by the amplified electrical energy.
It registers the amount of radiation excit-
ing the phosphor, according to the engi-
neers.
Attention CM Instructors
Textbooks have said for years that the
melting point and the solidification point
of a metal are identical temperatures. It
isn't so, according to General Electric Re-
search Laboratory scientists.
The scientists have been studying the
Behavior of metal droplets by means of
special microscope equipment. They have
found that the solidifying points of metals
are far lower than previously believed—
lower than the temperatures at which they
melt.
It is impurities which cause metals to
solidify at their textbook solidification
points, according to G-E scientists. The
barest trace of impurities is enough to
make molten metals "freeze" at tempera-
tures above the solidification points for
pure metals, they said.
The new microscope equipment makes
it possible to study metals absolutely free
of impurities, which are not found in na-
ture, and which are rarely produced by
man. This purity is achieved by dividing
nearly-pure metal samples into tiny drop-
lets. Certain of the droplets will, by
chance, be pure.
The new microscope attachment is a
temperature-controlled metal chamber with
a quartz window in it. By watching the
droplets in the chamber through the quartz
window with a microscope, the scientists
can count the number of droplets solidi-
fying as the chamber temperature is low-
ered.
Certain of the droplets, free of impuri-
ties, have been seen to remain molten
well below the supposed solidification
point for whatever metal is being studied.
This has proved to be true for every
metal tested to date. The growing list
now includes selenium, bismuth, lead,
antimony, cobalt, iron, and palladium. In
each case, the temperature at which the
pure droplets solidified was roughly 20
per cent lower than the melting point in
terms of degrees above absolute zero.
Better Heat Transmission
A better method of transmitting heat in
high-intensity motion picture projectors is
promised by a new development of East-
man Kodak Company.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BY
MURRAY H. MILLER, Grad.

MURRAY H. MILLER
No doubt you have run headlong into
problems presented in two sentences which
appear trivial, and yet when you've tried
to crack them they got harder to solve.
Last semester we encountered quite a few
like that. We weren't dismayed in the
least—at first. After all, with the tre-
mendous powers of the calculus and ad-
vanced physics, the prestige of attendance
at the University of Michigan, what prob-
lem could defy solution? It wasn't long
before we lost our great illusions. It
took us quite a while to solve those prob-
lems and when we did, we found that to
augment any tools you gain through study
you need a dash of common sense spiced
with a bit of clear thinking.
We've collected several problems to il-
lustrate our point. They require nothing
in the way of knowledge above the high
school level and are only difficult because
of the mental gymnastics necessary in solv-
ing them.
The Easy One
Take an easy one to start with. Suppose
we gave you six coins and told you that
there was one counterfeit heavier than the
others in the lot. Suppose further that we
permitted you the use of only a chemical
balance, one of that type which permits
you to determine only if an object is
heavier, the same weight as, or lighter
than another object. And to make you
think we're going to permit you to use the
balance only twice. There are two ways to
do this so you ought to get it right away.
We have one now that's quite a favor-
ite of our's. It was told to us by a friend
many years ago, and we spent a good deal
of time solving it. It, very simply stated,
is, prove that the product of any three
consecutive numbers is divisible by six.
We'll throw in a broad hint by saying that
the product of any two consecutive num-
bers is divisible by two.
The Mobius Strip
We'd like to tell you about an interest-
ing bit of mathematical legerdemain which
you may or may not have heard of. Take
a strip of paper—an inch-wide strip cut
from the long side of a sheet of note book
paper will do. Hold the strip level, give
one end a 180° twist, and then tape the
two ends together. You now have what is
called a Mobius Strip. This strip has
some very peculiar properties. For in-
stance, it only has one edge and only one
side. Try running a pencil down the
center of the strip without lifting the pen-
cil off the paper. You'll find, on examina-
tion, after you reach your starting point
that you have traversed the entire visible
surface, the only surface. That's not all
that is peculiar about the Mobius Strip.

They tell a story about a family of
spiders who were resting in their web.
Now the web was in a room 15 feet high,
20 feet wide, and 25 feet long and was lo-
cated on a wall as shown in the figure.
On the opposite wall was a juicy fly.
Wanting to be up to date, the spiders call
you in as a consultant and ask you to tell
them the length of the shortest path to the
fly. Remember, the spiders can't fly; they
have to travel along the walls.
Here is a final problem. Suppose we
have two containers, one holding a quan-
tity of water, the other an equal quantity
of wine. Next take a volume of wine
from its container and pour into the water
container. Then take an equal volume of
the mixture in the water container and
pour it into the wine container. Now, is
there more wine in the water container
than water in the wine container, or vice
versa?

The characteristic of actual or poten-
tial leadership ability is quite closely re-
lated to the previous point. It goes one
step beyond the mere interest in people
however, and concerns itself with the
ability to effectively guide those people
in order to achieve the objective of the
manufacturing organization.

control or production control.
In the field of direct supervision would
be such positions as foremen, factory su-
perintendents, and plant managers. These
represent the "line" functions of the typi-
cal line and staff organization. The ulti-

Typical Opportunities
The opportunities in manufacturing
cover a sufficiently wide variety as to be
able to satisfy most engineering gradu-
ates. Typical of the types of activities they
would engage in are:
Production Control
Wage Rate Administration
Cost Accounting
Labor Relations
Factory Supervision
Personnel Administration
Quality Control
Purchasing
Inventory Control
These typical fields may be classified in
two general groups; those which involve
direct or line supervision of factory per-
sonnel, and those which cover functional
organization is usually placed in these line
officials.
The functional fields typified by quality
control and production control are gen-
erally analogous to the staff functions of
a line and staff organization. In this type
of activity, the technical graduate could
look forward to becoming supervisor of
inventory control, purchasing agent, labor
relations manager, or to being an import-
ant member of the staff of these indi-
viduals.
Manufacturing opportunities, whether
they lie in line or staff positions, com-
pare favorably with those in such fields as
sales or design and developmental engi-
neering. While salaries differ between
companies and different geographical
areas, the successful manufacturing man
can hope to reach the same salary levels as
in these other fields. In addition, the
current emphasis on manufacturing has
further raised the "status" of such activity
to the extent that "manufacturing" has an
equivalent status to "engineering."
Training Programs
This article has dealt with two major
questions: what are the personal require-
ments for a manufacturing man, and what
are his opportunities. Many companies
bridge this gap between what the engi-
neering graduate has to offer and what the
company has to offer by means of a train-
ing program, formal or informal. Such
programs usually involve the training of a
man in one specialty, supplemented by
giving him a broad over-all understanding
of manufacturing as a whole.
Typical of these training programs is
the Advanced Manufacturing Leadership
Program of the General Electric Com-
pany's Apparatus Department. This pro-
gram selects capable candidates from
among its own professional engineers,
business training students, and apprentice
training graduates. Men from a!l three of
these groups have previously completed
other company training programs ranging
in length from one year for most test
engineers to four years for apprentice
graduates. In addition, following these
training programs, engineers generally
have several years of actual job experi-
ence before being chosen for the Ad-
vanced Program.
Once selected for the Advanced Manu-
facturing Leadership Program, these men
are given an intensive two-year program
consisting of job rotation and classroom
work. At the conclusion of two years,
the trainee has covered such diverse
functions as Wage Rate Administration,
Methods and Planning, Production Con-
trol, Labor Relations, and Cost Control.
This job rotation is supplemented by class-
room work in subjects such as materials
and processes, business and economics, or-
ganization planning and administrative
practices, and public speaking.
The engineering graduate, equipped
with the personal requirements listed
above, afforded the training equivalent to
that described above, can count on in-
dustry's supplying adequate opportunity
for him to make a significant contribution
to industrial progress and, at the same
time, to supply him with satisfying and in-
teresting professional occupation.

How to make 16

These odd looking little gadgets, called "pawls,"
go into high speed telephone dials used by Bell
System operators.
Until recently, pawls (like the black one) were
made of molded rubber with a steel pin for the shaft.
They did their job well and lasted a long time. But
Western Electric engineers decided to try to make
them at a lower shop cost.
The engineers came up with an idea —mold the
pawl, pin and all—in one piece of nylon. They made
some samples—tested them thoroughly—found the
nylon pawls would last as long and perhaps even
longer in service. Bell Telephone Laboratories tested
them—and approved. So Western Electric engineers
tackled the production problems — designed new
machinery for molding pawls in one piece. It wasn't

easy —because all dimensions had to be controlled
with extreme accuracy. But today the new nylon
pawls are being made in quantities—sixteen of them
for the cost of one of the old type!
This story of cost reduction—and there are scores
of others like it — shows one way that Western
Electric engineers help to keep down the cost of
equipment produced for Bell Telephone companies
and, therefore, the cost of service to telephone users.

increases engine weight because the air
is forced into the engine at higher density.
This means increased horsepower in the
compressor and the turbine and higher
internal pressure in the engine. At high
speeds the temperature of the incoming
air is raised as much as several hundred
degrees F. This temperature rise is multi-
plied in the engine and may require the
substitution of heavier materials for some
of the light alloy components that cannot
withstand higher operating temperatures.
Operation at higher altitudes requires
larger combustion chambers to maintain
flame stability and combustion efficiency,
which also increases weight. Therefore,
as operational altitudes and flight speeds
increase, engines become heavier.
With increased requirements for auxil-
iary power from the engine, with more
compressed air being tapped from the en-
gine, and with the addition of further
emergency safety provisions, engine ac-
cessories—gearboxes, pumps, controls, etc.
—become heavier. Accessory weight con-
sequently becomes a larger percentage of
the overall weight. On early engines ac-
cessory weight averaged 10 percent of the
total, but it has been as much as 30 per-
cent.
Frontal Area
A small frontal area for a given amount
of thrust permits a smaller engine package
with lower drag, ideal for nacelle and
wing installations. Where the engine is
housed inside the fuselage, frontal area
is not too significant if the engine fits en-
tirely within the fuselage contours of the
airplane.
Component improvements have brought
about an increase in the amount of thrust
obtainable from a given mass of air flow-
ing into the engine. Other design refine-
ments have resulted in better external
streamlining of the power plant. Both
factors increase the ratio of thrust to
frontal area. But, here again ,the need
for more appendages in the form of ad-
ditional or larger accessories partly offsets
these benefits. However, the net result is
still one of much increased power for the
same engine frontal area.
For centrifugal engines the thrust per
unit frontal area has increased from a
representative 225 lb. per sq. ft. in 1944
to a typical value of 400 lb. per sq. ft. in
1949. Axial-flow units, which started off
with considerable variation, have now
passed the mark of 600 lb. per sq. ft.
(Continued from page 7)
Several means of thrust augmentation
have appeared. All are premised on the
basic law of jet propulsion, namely, that
engine thrust is the product of mass ac-
celerated and velocity of exhaust. Hence,
to increase thrust, either the mass or the
jet velocity, or both, must be increased.
Water injection, resulting in a cooling
of the gases entering the turbine, permits
the addition of more fuel without exceed-
ing the permissible turbine inlet tempera-
ture. The water, as well as the additional
fuel, increases the mass of gases exhaust-
ing from the nozzle. This form of aug-
mentation, useful particularly for take-off,
nets an additional thrust in the neigh-
borhood of 20 percent.
Burning additional fuel in a tailpipe
beyond the turbine (afterburning) in-
creases the temperature and consequently
the volume and velocity of the exhaust
gases. This can yield some 40 percent ad-
ditional thrust at standstill and more than
twice this at higher flight speeds. While
afterburner operation is expensive of fuel,
it provides short bursts of terrific power.
Thus, engines with afterburners are par-
ticularly suitable for interceptor-type air-
craft where flash performance is desired.
Centrifugal vs. Axial Flow
As more and more factual data becomes
available, the violent controversy concern-
ing the relative superiority of the two
types of turbojets is subsiding. Each has
advantages and shortcomings that govern
its application. On the basis of typical
performance, the frontal area of centrifu-
gal engines is now some 50 percent
greater than that of axial-flow engines.
This differential is prohibitive for na-
celle-type installation in high-speed air-
craft. Early experience showed the cen-
trifugal engine to be much lighter than its
rival. However, this difference has now
practically disappeared.
Considering "static, sea-level" perform-
ance—obtained in test-cell operation—the
centrifugal engine compares favorably for
pressure ratios up to four or five to one.
This is about the maximum ratio at which
a single impeller has, so far, operated effi-
ciently. Increased pressure ratio—for
lower fuel consumption—in a centrifugal
design requires several impellers in series,
which is generally less, efficient because of
the losses inherent in the curved ducts of
the compressor.
Aircraft engines, however, are not built
for static, sea-level operation, but for
flight. At operational altitudes the centri-
fugal engine with a double-sided impeller
(air passes on both sides of the impeller
disc) suffers an additional loss because of
the poor efficiency of the inlet ducting.
Kinetic energy of the incoming air is lost
in the plenum chambers at the inlet. This
can increase fuel consumption by five or
ten percent more than in the case of an
axial inlet leading directly to the engine
intake. This loss is avoided in centrifugal
engines with single-sided impellers, but is
offset by a larger frontal area.
Because of all these factors, the axial-
flow design is replacing the centrifugal
type in large power plants in which effi-
ciency is the most important considera-
tion. Centrifugal compressors continue
to find use in smaller engines, such as for
auxiliary drives, because they are cheaper
to produce and because axial-flow com-
pressor blading of small size is not as
efficient. Combination designs, partly
axial flow and partly contrifugal, also have
advantages for some applications.
Annular and Can-Type Combustors
The two best-known forms of combus-
tion chambers—the "can" type and the
"annular" type—have been applied both
in this country and in England. In the
can-type combustor the air stream leaving
the compressor divides into a number of
diffuser passages leading to separate, ap-
proximately cylindrical, combustion cham-
bers. The combustion products from these
individual "cans" are then reunited in the
turbine nozzle element. In the annular-
burner design a single chamber surrounds
the turbine shaft.
Although the can-type combustor is
simpler to design and evaluate, it has sev-
eral disadvantages not found in the annu-
lar combustor. At high altitudes, the loss
of flame in one or several of the individ-
ual combustors of a can-equipped engine
results in severely irregular temperature
distribution. Also, accumulation of fuel
in the bottom cans might result in exces-
sive temperatures when ignited. The
single flame in the annular chamber
avoids these difficulties and it is more
readily maintained. For the same external
diameter the lower gas velocities in the
annular combustor promote better altitude
combustion stability.

Just AS SNUC HARBORS offer ships protection from stormy
seas, there are protective coatings today that guard them
against sleet, snow, salt spray—and other damaging forces.
There is a plastic coating for ships' hulls that eases the
age-old problem of barnacles and rust. Vessels stay in serv-
ice twice as long between costly lav-ups in drydock for
cleaning and painting. Top-side and below, there are long-
wearing coatings to keep the modern craft ship-shape.
Tankers at sea—and tanks ashore—get double protection,

safe from attack by water, acids, alkalies, or other chemicals.
These sea-going coatings are made of the same kinds of

In a triumph of synthetic chemistry, these ever-useful basic

Willi annular chambers it is relatively
easy to vary the radial temperature distri-
bution of the gases passing into the tur-
bine to get best temperature-stress rela-
tion, and, therefore, the lightest blades
to tarry the load. Near the tip of the tur-
bine blade, where stresses are low, the
temperature can be permitted to run
higher than near the blade root, where the
stresses are high. This same slanted tem-
perature distribution is obtainable by mak-
ing the can-type combustors nonsymmetri-
cal, but this complicates combustor design.
Engine Development
Reciprocating aircraft-engine develop-
ment has been characterized by what has
become known as "make and break" pro-
cedure. Because of the inherent difficulties
in predicting nonsteady conditions in a
piston engine, they are customarily de-
signed on the basis of the best available
(often empirical) knowledge, relying
largely on complete engine testing to
bring out'weak spots in the design and to
carry out further engine improvements.
In the reciprocating engine, the compres-
sion, combustion, and expansion processes
(Continued from page 16}
all take place in the cylinder, but in the
gas turbine these processes are handled
by individual components, namely, the
compressor, combustor, turbine, and ex-
haust nozzle, which can be studied sep-
arately. Thus, a closer analysis of the
functioning of each individual component
is possible.
In the case of the gas turbine, planned
research and development of engine ele-
ments to accumulate basic knowledge for
future designs gives a high degree of as-
surance that expected performance will be
obtained. This fundamental approach is
economic from the standpoint of effort as
well as time. It frequently permits use of
inexpensive models, rather than costly
full-size components, to derive the data
the designer needs. Admittedly, much
proof testing of the finished product will
always be required. Then, after a new
engine comes to test, component refine-
ments can be worked out by studying en-
gine performance in detail.
Materials
One of the developments upon which
the capabilities of the gas turbine depend

Ci&gt;»rtfs\ Vtstimgbvmse
Measuring temperatures of turbine blading undergoing "thermal shock" tests.
is the progress in high-temperature alloys.
Many of the forged and cast materials
now being used in production engines are
of prewar origin but have been gradually
improved.
Early rotating turbine blades, where
stresses as well as temperatures are high,
were made of K42B alloy, Hastelloy B,
and several others. To withstand blade
vibration, materials must have high creep
resistance and good fatigue strength at
high temperature.
Turbine discs (the rotating member to
which the blades are affixed), on the
other hand, must have high strength at
only moderate temperature. Disc materials
available in the early 40's, and since con-
siderably refined, include 19-9-DL and
Timken 16-25-6. Among the new arriv-
als, Discaloy alloy is outstanding for high-
creep strength.
One of the major contributions the
turbojet engine has made to the turbine
art is the large-scale use of precision cast-
ings. Precision-cast turbine blades were
first used in superchargers, where they per-
formed well. Their application to turbo-
jet engines required much larger castings
and imposed more extreme operating
stresses on these parts.
The first precision-cast turbine and
compressor blading appeared in the J-32
(9.5 A) turbojet engine. Vitallium and
several other materials of the Stellite fam-
ily have been used successfully. As of
today, cast blading has been thoroughly
proved in field operation.
Use of precision castings for blades
gives the designer wide latitude in the
choice of blade shapers. From this stand-
point casting produces results superior to
those obtained by the usual machining or
rolling. New blade configurations can be
obtained in experimental quantities quick-
ly, thus allowing reasonably rapid verifica-
tion.
Reliance on creep-rupture and fatigue
testing to evaluate materials for use at
high temperatures has been customary
practice. Now, for the kind of operation
to which gas turbines are subjected, addi-
tional attention is being paid to the effect
of "thermal shock" (rapid heating and
cooling cycles) on the behavior of parts
such as turbine-nozzle vanes. Materials
that are "brittle" under these severe con-

THE "WHY" OF BATTERY MATERIALS
(Continued
Anode Materials
The opposite of oxidation must occur
at the anode in order to have the electrons
from the cathode balance out. Thus the
anode should be an oxidizing agent, i.e.,
should be reduced during discharge. Inas-
much as the electrolyte is a water solution,
the positive plate cannot be water soluble.
In addition it must be neither too active—
which would result in spontaneous reac-
tion, nor insufficiently active—in which
case the potential per cell would be low.
In addition, the substance must be as
cheap as possible, consistent with physi-
cal requirements. Substances which meet

Of these possible anodes, only lead
peroxide can be used in an acid electro-
lyte while nickel peroxide may be em-
ployed only in an alkaline electrolyte.
Electrolytes
Thus we have for the acid electrolyte
cell the necessity of using Pb cathode and
Pb02 anode. The electrolyte for the acid
cell must perform three functions: (1)
carry the current between the plates; (2),
react with the electrodes to produce cur-
rent; and (3) deposit the discharge prod-
uct in the pores of the plate in a manner
which does not block further reaction. It
has been found experimentally that SUI-

these requirements are listed in table 3
together with their watt-hour/pound rat-
ing. This tabulation, like the earlier one,
is misleading if resistivity is not consid-
ered. Again, where a large current is
drawn (an auto starter may draw 300 am-
peres current on a cold morning) the I2R
loss becomes important.
Nickel peroxide suffers the handicap
of high resistivity. Its large watt-hour/
pound capacity, however, makes it practi-
cal to attempt to overcome this disad-
vantage. This is done by using a grid
structure with very small pellets of NiOz
in order to increase surface area. Thus,
although Ni02 has a high resistivity, the
tremendous capacity is enough to permit
its use as an anode.
Manganese dioxide also is a poor elec-
trical conductor and has a poor energy ef-
ficiency which practically prohibits its use
in secondary cells.
A lead peroxide anode combines fairly
high capacity with low resistivity and
hence is quite useful. The watt hour/
pound ratio of copper oxide is so low that,
despite good electrical conductivity, it is
not used. Antimony pentoxide is econom-
ically impractical and molebdynem tri-
oxide, although having promise electrical-
ly, is presently too expensive for economic
use.
phuric acid performs these functions the
best.
The alkaline cell must use an iron ca-
thode and a nickel peroxide anode. Its
electrolyte, however, serves a different
purpose than that of the acid battery. In
the former, the alkali probably does not
react with the plates, its function being
to carry the current while the water is the
active electrolytic agent. Lithium hydrox-
ide and sodium hydroxide are both
theoretically and practically good because
they have high electrical conductivity.
Sodium hydroxide is the electrolyte gener-
ally used because of its lower cost.
The following discharge reactions for
the two types of cells will serve to illu-
strate both the method of supplying elec-
trons and the difference in function of the
electrolytes:
Lead-acid: PbOj + Pb -f 2H2S04^&gt;
2PbS04 + 2H20
Iron-nickel: Ni02 + Fe -&gt; NiO +
FeO
(The latter equation is simple, and al-
though probably incorrect is as good a
working premise as any.)
We see, then, that battery materials
used today are far from arbitrarily chosen.
Unless some of the scarcer metals come
into greater supply these same materials
will be used in the future.

Why we know this wax carton will stand up
Cartons and wrapping papers coated with
paraffin wax have been used in food packag-
ing for many years. They must be able to
withstand rough treatment. Their ability to
stand up depends largely on the strength and
sealing qualities of the coating agent. Yet
until a few months ago, there was no accu-
rate way to measure these qualities in paraf-
fin wax.
Recent experimental work in Standard
Oil's laboratories has resulted in a new elec-
trically controlled quantitative test. Ex-
pressed as Indiana Coating Index, this test
gives, for the first time, an accurate yard-
stick of wax qualities which may be corre-
lated with performance in service. It makes
possible the production of uniformly high
quality coating agents.
The Indiana Coating Index is only one of
many scientific tests developed in Standard
Oil laboratories. Standard pioneered in qual-
ity-testing, as it did in developing many
petroleum products that have contributed to
better living. There is no ceiling on what can
be accomplished by Standard Oil researchers,
present and future.

PROBLEM — You're working out the application of a
hydraulic speed selector system to a turret lathe. The
system's oil pump is to be driven by a belt take-off
from the main belt drive. Your problem now Is to
provide a means for transmitting power from the pump
drive pulley to the pump that will permit the adjustment
of the pulley to regulate belt tension. How would
you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER — Use an S.S.White flexible shaft
between the pulley shaft and the pump shaft. As you
see below, that's how the Gisholt Machine Co., did It.
An S.S.White flexible shaft is the logical answer for a
wide range of drives where one or both of the con-
nected members must be adjustable in position.

This is jusl one ol hundreds of power drive and remote control problems
to which S.S.WHITE FLEXIBLE SHAFTS are the simple onswer. That's why
engineers will find it helpful to be familiar with the range and scope of
these "METAL MUSCLES'" for mechanical bodies.

editions can easily crack in a relatively few hours. To obtain
data under simulated service operations, a simple apparatus is
used, in which a specimen is alternately heated to 1950 degrees
F and air quenched. From such tests optimum material compo-
sition and heat treatments have been derived.
On the light-alloy side the most phenomenal developments
is the advent of titanium, which promises to have the strength
of good steel at medium temperatures with only two-thirds its
weight. It has good corrosion resistance and might find appli-
cation in many jet parts that operate at moderate temperatures,
that is, up to 800 or perhaps 1000 degrees F. Titanium can be
produced in sheet form or as a forging; thus it has several
natural applications on the "cold" side of the engine. As in the
case of other light metals, further alloying of titanium will
undoubtedly yield improved materials, having even greater
strength.
Compressor Research
The development of compressors of adequately high effi-
ciency was one of the steps needed to make the gas turbine
possible. Considerable progress is being made towards a better
understanding of the function of gas-turbine blading. Much
of the needed data can be obtained from model tests.
Simple models are used in a series of basic, low-speed tests
to evaluate compressor-stage performance under conditions of
operation well below sonic velocities. In these tests, variables
such as blade spacing (pitch), blade setting (stagger), and
blade section are being systematically explored. This work,
requiring only low power for the test equipment, is followed
by full-speed tests in which specific compressors as well as
their individual stages are evaluated in detail.
In view of the weight and cost of compressor blading,
emphasis has been placed on obtaining acceptable efficiency
with a small number of blades. (This does not necessarily
mean a small number of stages because there can be an ar-
rangement of a few stages with many blades per stage.) It
appears that large pressure ratios per stage can be obtained by
turning the flow through a larger angle; however, so far
this has involved increased energy losses and poorer efficiency.
Bearing and Lubrication
In early turbojet operation the performance of the bearing
and lubrication system was often one of the critical items
that limited engine life. However, opposed to central-station
and marine-turbine practice, in which the use of journal
bearings is traditional, antifriction bearings have been a
complete success in aviation gas turbines. Although some early
American engines employed film lubrication, antifriction bear-
ings are now practically universal. Engine-oil consumption in
the turbojet amounts to only a fraction of a pound per hour.
Experience with the "oil mist" system of lubrication indicated
that it was difficult to apportion the proper amount of lubri-
cant to each bearing through varying temperatures, pressures,
and maneuvering demands. The use of "solid-oil lubrication"
for bearings has alleviated this problem.
To evaluate bearing performance it is important to run
bearings under controlled conditions. A testing machine

How to help a gearmotor
take care of its teeth
To minimize wear on the teeth and to insure
smooth, quiet operation, reduction gears in motors
like this must be held in perfect mesh, no matter
what the load. That's one reason why engineers
mount the gear shafts on Timken® tapered roller
bearings. Timken bearings hold the shafts in accu-
rate alignment. Gears are kept perfectly positioned,
with each tooth meshing smoothly and carrying
its full share of the load.
Gears mesh smoothly,
wear longer, with shafts
on TIMKEN® bearings
Here is a typical gear-case countershaft showing
a common method of mounting Timken bearings.
Due to the line contact between the rolls and races,
Timken bearings give the shaft maximum support.
There's less chance of deflection under load. The
tapered bearing design takes both radial and thrust
loads in any combination. End-movement of the
shaft is kept to a minimum. Gears wear longer-
work better.

stead of silver. The coatings reflect most
of the light but transmit nearly all of the
heat.
Overheating and buckling of motion
picture film, especially when 16 mm is
projected with arc lamp light, has been a
problem for design engineers. Heat-ab-
sorbing glass placed between the light
source and the film often becomes so hot it
cracks.
Experimentation by George J. Koch and
Doris Brinsmaid of the Kodak Camera
Works' development department has led
to the present coatings which consist of
layers of transparent material having alter-
nately high and low refractive index.
The Kodak scientists have found that
by adjusting the thickness of the layers so
that visible light is reflected from each
layer "in step" with the light reflected
from others, the combination produces
high reflection. Wave lengths outside the
visible region are reflected "out of step"
and pass through the mirror. Thus there
is high transmission of heat.

designed at the Westinghouse Research
Laboratories, permits running the test
bearing under controlled temperatures up
to 600 degrees F with thrust loads up to
20,000 pounds and radial loads to 12,000
pounds. Bearings are now as reliable as
other engine parts.
Combustion
Early experience with jet engines
proved that at increasing altitudes, with
reduced air density and lower ambient
temperature, efficient combustion becomes
more and more difficult to sustain. Under
such conditions the efficiency of the com-
bustion chamber can deteriorate severely
and the flame might even go out com-
pletely. Several early engines ran into
such operational troubles at altitudes be-
low 30,000 feet. With continuing research
and development it has been possible to
increase considerably the altitudes at
which the performance of the combustion
chamber deteriorates.
Flame stability generally improves as
gas velocity through the burner is de-
creased. Thus larger combustion chambers
improve combustion, but combustor per-
(Continued from page 22)
formance at these altitudes must be
bought with increased size and weight.
One of the drawbacks of early combus-
tion-chamber designs was their relatively
short life, limited often to a few hours'
operation. Careful attention to the struc-
tural requirements of combustion cham-
bers has made possible a manyfold in-
crease in combustor life. One of the most
successful means of improving the me-
chanical reliability of combustion cham-
bers has been the provision of a blanket
of relatively cool air over the combustion
walls. Thus the metal remains at mod-
erate temperatures despite the close prox-
imity of flame temperatures of some 3700
degrees F. Several combustors in produc-
tion-type engines have operated through
periods of 600 hours and were still fit for
service.
Control and Fuel System
Originally almost any system of getting
fuel into the engine was permissible. Now
the more complex systems must deliver
fuel to the combustion chamber satisfac-
torily even at extreme altitudes, give safe
engine control under any flight conditions,
and yet require minimum attention from
the pilot.
It must supply fuel in widely varying
quantities throughout the operating range
—from full load at sea level to cruising
conditions at the ceiling altitude of the
aircraft. This range can easily be 30 to 1.
If fuel is fed to the combustion chamber
through atomizing spray nozzles with fix-
ed orifice, a 900-to-l pressure variation is
necessary to give a 30-to-l variation in
fuel flow. To obtain good spray charac-
teristics, a certain minimum pressure is re-
quired; but with fixed orifices, pressures
for sea-level, fuel-load condition become
high. This is unfavorable to long full-
pump life and requires fuel-spray nozzles
of wide range.
Turbojet Future
Performance and reliability of aviation-
gas-turbine engines in the past have been
generally satisfactory and in most cases
beyond expectations. In the future, proper
planning, research, and development will
undoubtedly bring forth engines that are
superior from the standpoint of fuel econ-
omy as well as flight safety.

GET THE MOST
RAY LADENDORF
Editor-in-Chief
What is wrong with the Michigan
engineer? An all-campus poll of Michi-
gan coeds showed that socially, engineers
rate third among the colleges. Significant-
ly, numerous coeds stated that because
engineers think of everything in terms of
the slide rule, they prove to be dull com-
panions.
This seems to be the typical Literary
College impression. It is further evi-
denced by the feud between the Lawyers
and the "illiterate" engineers and by the
fact that the engineering faculty is gen-
erally considered the most reactionary on
the campus.
Engineers as a group generally lack cul-
ture, lack appreciation of the "finer things
of life," lack an understanding of con-
temporary political, economic, and social
institutions.
What Do We Want?
First of all, do we want just an engi-
neering education, or do we want some-
thing more? It is true that our primary
objective in College of Engineering is to
prepare ourselves to pursue and find a
good substantial future in creative indus-
try. Our college exists only to assist us in
attaining this objective. But should we
not get something more from our years
at Michigan, something beyond the com-
paratively narrow confines of engineer-
ing? Certainly we should develop an
understanding of the social and psycho-
logical forces affecting our lives. The
average engineer, before graduation or
after, seems to be only mildly interested in
these forces. He does not know them as
well as he does the forces in a bar in
EM 1; since he does not understand them
the engineer normally will avoid them
and so will tend to narrow his perspective
of his work and his world even further.
Who Is To Blame?
Where does the fault lie? Who is to
blame for the stuffiness of Michigan engi-
neers? It can be said that it is the fault of
the curriculum; engineers are supposed to
spend just about all their time on engi-
neering subjects with only two to four
elective courses allowed or required out-
side the college.
It can be said that the instructors and
professor are at fault; many of them are
notorious for teaching only the subject at
hand without tying it in to what has gone
before or what is to come. Very few
professors bother to teach how a course
fits in with our education as a whole and
we have never yet found a professor who
explained the relationship of factors out-
side engineering—political, social, and
economic factors—to the problem at hand.
It is true that both the curriculum and
the teaching of it are partly to blame for
the lack of breadth of the engineer's edu-
cation. But the main part of the blame
must fall squarely on the shoulders of
each individual engineer. The Engineer-
ing College education is designed to be
narrow but deep. We fail in not widen-
ing and spreading out the top. College is
for us, and if we do not make full use
of it, it is our own fault.
What Can We Do?
What should be done? What can be
done to make our education more useful
to us technically and socially? If the cur-
riculum is at fault we shou."d change it.
Whether this is done—it probably would
mean at least a five year course for a
Bachelor of Science degree—is somewhat
doubtful from the economic viewpoint of
the student in school and the time lost in
starting work in industry.
If the faculty needs to change its ap-
proach in teaching they should become
aware of the fact. (Opinions are so-
licited by the editors)
The Biggest Change
However, the biggest change can be
made by those who are mostly to blame:
we, the students. The fastest, surest pro-
cedure of broadening our education can
be executed only by us. If we really want
an understanding of the political, eco-
nomic, and social forces of our existence
we each must expand our own individual
curriculum. If we cannot afford to spend
an extra semester here we can take extra
courses each semester, beyond the re-
quired 140 hours. If this proves to be too
much of a load we can always audit
courses and soak up knowledge by
osmosis.
This is the easiest and yet the" hardest
method of reaching our goal. It is easy
because it requires no red tape, no cur-
riculum or college policy changes. It is
hard because it places the burden on the
individual's shoulder where the tempta-
tion to just take it easy is strong. But
remember, there is no reason for us to be
stuffy, narrow minded engineers. The
University of Michigan exists for us. It
is up to us to get the most out of it.

Here, in a tiny area far too small to examine easily,

Such are the wonders of photography. They are
wonders that serve entertainment—can serve science,
business, and industry in countless ways as well.
For example, motion pictures can present your prod-

can explain production methods —dramatize safety
measures —train salesmen. They can spark interest

With pictorial animation they can make difficult
processes clear. They can make time go fast, go slow,
or even backward, to facilitate a study or improve
a demonstration. All of this because of the inherent

The Teflon Problem:
Given a plastic for which there is no known solvent,
how would you turn it into a coating?
1 ^"*
^JFT
s .

III
Some time ago Du Pont research dis-
covered a new plastic—"Teflon" tet-
rafluoroethylene resin. It had tem-
perature resistance beyond the range
of any previous plastic, excellent elec-
trical characteristics, and the highest
degree of chemical inertness among
commercial plastics.
But tough-guy "Teflon" was
almost too tough. It wouldn't melt
and flow like other plastics. Hence,
it could be molded only in simple
shapes. There was no existing tech-
nique by which it could be made into
thin coatings. Unless this difficulty
could be overcome, the very proper-
ties that made "Teflon" so promis-
ing narrowed its usefulness.
"Teflon" Won't Dissolve
In the past, problems like this have
been handled by dissolving plastics
in a suitable solvent and using them
as the base for enamels and similar
coatings. But "Teflon" will not dis-
solve in any solvent yet known. It
even stands up to nitric acid.
At this point Du Pont physical
chemists suggested dispersions-
minute particles suspended in a liq-
uid—as the answer. After much
study, scientists of the Poly chemicals
Department learned how to suspend
"Teflon" particles about 1/125,000
of an inch in diameter. Aided by the
fundamental studies of Chemical
Department scientists, they devised
today's commercial scale process.
Meanwhile Du Pont's Fabrics and
Finishes Department was keeping
pace with the development. Their
contributions to formulating the new
products did much to establish "Tef-
lon" polytetrafluoroethylene coat-
ings and wire enamels in many
special uses.
In electric motors, for instance,
these enamels are used on wire so
the motor can be operated at higher
temperatures and will deliver more
power per unitofweight.Such motors
are more compact and sometimes
cost less.
Other uses include non-sticking
coatings that cut costs when applied
to bakery rolls, rubber molds, heat-
sealing machinery and similar equip-
ment. Corrosion-resistant "Teflon"
coatings for special uses are currently
being investigated.
Product of Teamwork
"Teflon" finishes are a typical fruit
of the close teamwork of Du Pont
technicalmenof diverse backgrounds.
Organic and physical chemists played
a major role. Physicists participated
by developing fundamental informa-
tion on the nature of the dispersion.
Chemical and mechanical engineers
designed the manufacturing appara-
tus. Workingtogether,theymade pos-
sible this new and important addi-
tion to theDu Pont family of "Better

Ever take a close-up of a modern chemical plant in action . . .
from research . . . through production ... to the time the
products are on the market? Let's take a look at Dow—one of
the nation's leading chemical producers—by following just one
product through the plant:
Dowtherm, for example, is a Dow-developed chemical for
process heating. It brings accurate heat control and added
safety not found in direct flame heating. Although Dowtherm is
widely used already in many factory processes, Dow Technical
Service and Research regularly aid in developing new applications
for this outstanding Dow-developed heat exchange medium.
Products now using Dowtherm in their manufacture include:
nylon, plastics, varnish, vegetable shortening, soap, chemicals,
asphalt, natural gas and fried noodles.
Once Dowtherm had proved itself in the laboratories, production
took over to manufacture this important heat exchange medium
for the processing plants of the nation. At the same time, the
Dow sales department organized new service and distribution
channels and gave special training to production engineers who
would handle this new method for process heating.
Dowtherm is only one of over 600 Dow chemicals indispensable
to industry and agriculture. Multiply the complexities involved
in researching, producing and marketing this one product by
several hundred in the Dow line and you will understand why a
close-up of a modern chemical company reveals one of the
industrial achievements of the twentieth century.

One of the research projects sponsored by the Office of Naval Research deals
with the investigation of nuclear energy levels by means of high precision
spectroscopy of gamma and beta radiations from radioactive nuclei.
The equipment shown above is used to determine the structure of atomic nu-
clei by observing the gamma rays that are emitted from the radioactive nuclei.
The rays emitted are refracted by the magnets of the beta spectrometer and
recorded on a sensitive plate. The formation of the spectrographic lines on
the photographic plate is studied to determine the nuclear energy level of
radioactive materials.

Strength factors of Long Life!
No pipe that is provably deficient in any of these
strength factors should ever be laid in city streets
w«
rithout bursting strength—or, for that
matter—without all of the strength factors
listed opposite—no pipe laid 100 years
ago in city streets would be in service
today. But, in spite of the evolution of
traffic from horse-drawn vehicles to heavy
trucks and buses—and today's vast
complexity of subway and underground
utility services—cast iron gas and water
mains, laid over a century ago. are
serving in the streets of more than 30
cities in the United States and Canada.
Such service records prove that cast iron
pipe combines all the strength factors of
long life with ample margins of safety. No

In full length bursting tests standard 6-inch
cast Iron pipe withstands more than 2500 lbs.
per square inch internal hydrostatic pressure,
which proves ample ability to resist water-

The toughness of cast iron pipe which enables
it to withstand impact and traffic shocks, as
well as the hazards in handling, is demon-
strated by the Impact Test. While under hydro-
static pressure and the heavy blows from a
SO pound hammer, standard 6-inch cast iron
pipe does not crack until the hammer Is
dropped 6 times on the same spot from pro-
gressively increased heights of 6 inches.
The ability of cast iron pipe to withstand ex-
ternal loads Imposed by heavy fill and un-
usual traffic loads is proved by the Ring
Compression Test, Standard 6-inch cast iron
pipe withstands a crushing weight of more
than 14.000 lbs. per foot
When cast iron pipe is subjected to beam
stress caused by soil settlement or disturbance
of soil by other utilities, or resting on an ob-
struction, tests prove that standard 6-inch cast
iron pipe in 10-foot span sustains a load of
15.000 lbs.

Dedicated to

The new home of the Westinghouse
Educational Center where new em-
ployees from engineering colleges
receive an orientation and training
program to help them find the kind
of work they like to do and are
likely to do best. Hundreds of ex-
perienced professional people help
carry out this program. A Graduate
Study Program is also made avail-
able through which advanced
degrees may be obtained.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Building solidly for tomorrow is an important
phase of modern business . . . building men
for positions of leadership.
For more than half a century, Westinghouse
has placed major emphasis on this activity...
pioneering in student training . . . graduate
study courses ... encouragement of scientific
training through scholarships and fellow-
ships . . . and in many other ways.
Now we dedicate an entire new building
to this purpose—the Westinghouse Educa-
tional Center—a building devoted to the self-
improvement of men . . . dedicated to de-
veloping leadership.
Here, top students who are recruited at
leading engineering schools for positions
in engineering, manufacturing, sales and re-
search, come for an orientation and training
course that provides their first intimate view
of the electrical manufacturing industry . . .
and the varied opportunities it offers.
Every facility has been provided to help
these men get off to a firm, fast start... mod-
ern class rooms equipped for visual education
... a large auditorium with complete stage
and projection room facilities ... and a large,
comfortable library and study hall. Here an
intensive course of study is given by engi"
neers and scientists who are top-ranking men
in their fields.
These same facilities are also adequate to
take care of the needs of post-training-course
employees who are participating in the
Graduate Study Program and the many other
educational activities of Westinghouse.
For their convenience and comfort, there
is a cafeteria and generous space for formal
and informal gatherings. For relaxation and
recreation, there are hobby, billiard and game
rooms and outdoor recreation facilities.
Here, then, is a building dedicated to
developing leadership . . . that priceless
asset of a strong organization . . . able
management and professional leadership
for tomorrow. Another reason we say with
confidence . . . G-10116
you can be sure..if it's Westinghouse

Aided by the most modern facilities, experienced
professional people provide a panoramic view
of the research, engineering and manufacturing
that go into Westinghouse products and the
techniques used in marketing them.
In planning the new Educational Center, careful
thought was given to recreation. A spacious lounge,
hobby and game rooms, a billiard room, facilities for
indoor and outdoor sports along with a convenient
cafeteria—all contribute to a well-rounded program.

PROJECT
BY
HOMER FERGUSON, U. S. Senator
The Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Proj-
ect in essence is the creation of a
university center dedicated to a compre-
hensive study of the possibilities of atomic
science for peacetime progress. It will
consist of a functional building—with
laboratories, equipment, an auditorium,
lecture rooms and a library—to serve as
headquarters for scholarly and practical
study of the new frontiers and peaceful
application of atomic science. Some $6,-
500,000 will be devoted to the project,
two million of which is for the building
and the remainder of four and a half mil-
lion will be used for the varied research
projects.
The project excites interest because of
several unusual features which have gone
into its conception.
Phoenix Looks to the Future
First, the project starts at the point
where the successful discovery and mili-
tary application of atomic energy leaves
off. The principles of atomic science are
already well known the world over so
that the discovery stage is past. What
the people are asking today is, What
now? In other words, the great problem
facing the world now is how to develop
this remarkable science and how to apply
it for the advancement of civilization and
peace.
This is the problem on which the Michi-
gan memorial project will go to work.
Through a broad program of research
atomic science will be projected into the
fields of the biological and physical sci-
ences such as medicine, genetics, and bio-
chemistry. By coordination with the social
sciences, the project will seek to determine
the implications of atomic science for
economics, architecture, engineering, law,
community organization, and social wel-
fare. Thus the project will not only serve
as a center for technical and scientific
research, but will draw together all other
branches of knowledge of the university
in a coordinated effort to explore the
significance of atomic science in all human
endeavor.
The grand sweep of this conception be-
comes clear when it is realized that in the
past every discovery of new forms of

HOMER FERGUSON
energy resulted in tremendous changes
and confusion because mankind was un-
prepared to deal with revolutionary dis-
coveries. By beginning now, at the thresh-
old of atomic science, to explore its im-
plications and uses in peacetime life,
the Michigan project hopes to shorten the
time for adjustments and to dispel the
widespread public fear and helplessness
in the face of the unknown. The spirit
back of the project is that where the light
of knowledge shines, the darkness of fear
disappears.
A Free Enterprise Project
Second, the project typifies the resur-
gence of private enterprise. For a time
before and after the great depression of
1929, private enterprise in America lost
sight of the pioneering and initiative
which in our earlier days contributed
much to the greatness of our country.
The tendency was to drift and to sit back
and allow government to do the things
for our people which progress demands.
As we see totalitarian governments arise
out of too great public reliance upon gov-
ernment, many of us are awakened to the
dangers and unwisdom of such a course.
The time is ripe, therefore, for a return
to the great role private enterprise and
initiative did play and can again assume
in developing the world and serving its
people.
This is what the Michigan project now
seeks to do in the new field of atomic
science. The project seeks no money
from government. That bears repeating.
The project seeks and will accept no
money from government. The alumni of
the university will raise the funds re-
quired. The vast resources of the univers-
ity already in existence will be enlisted in
the job. The faculty and students of the
university, together with scholars and
technicians invited from the outside, will
do the work. The whole project is design-
ed to stand on its own feet.
Cooperation
And yet, there will be complete coop-
eration with all others working in the
field of atomic science. While no secret
or military research in atomic science is
contemplated, if anything of such a nature
is developed it will be turned over to the
Government as Michigan has already done
during more than 20 years of pioneering
in nuclear physics. There will be com-
plete cooperation with the Atomic Energy
Commission which is fully informed of
the Michigan project and heartily endorses
it. There will be cooperation with other
universities and foundations at work in
the field. Above all, there will be close
cooperation with private industry and with
public and private agencies which are
vitally interested in the peacetime develop-
ment of atomic science for the benefit of
mankind.
Here, then, is a combination of research
and education undertaken by a great uni-
versity with private funds. It is an in-
stance of private enterprise once more
resuming the role of pioneering at the
frontiers of new problems in a new day.
Here is a project which, in cooperation
with all others, promises to make a sub-
stantial contribution toward lessening the
public fear and disruption which a revolu-
tionary science tends to generate. At the
same time the whole spirit of the Michi-
gan undertaking is its dedication to the
search for the benefits which atomic sci-
ence may hold for the peaceful advance-
ment of civilization.
I can conceive of no more fitting me-
morial than this great university under-
taking which proposes to serve the liv-
ing in honor of the dead.

PHOENIX PROJECT
With the advent of atomic energy in
1945 many people prophesied the forth-
coming of a Utopian era—an era brought
about by the harnessing of the fundamen-
tal energies of matter. Now, five years
later, the prospect of such an era, from
a non-political viewpoint, is much closer
to reality. The realization is closer be-
cause of the broader understanding now
enjoyed of the problems involved in har-
nessing the atom. The Michigan Memor-
ial-Phoenix Project is a great step closer
to complete realization of the Utopian era.
To aid in this vital work, a number of
departments of the College of Engineer-
ing, U. of M., have submitted proposals
of research problems suitable for study
under sponsorship of Phoenix Project.
Most of these proposals concern directly
or indirectly the use of atomic energy in
power development. The remainder of
the proposals concern radioactivity in one
form or another, and are probably most
important from the short range point of
view.
In presenting these proposals, some in
more details than others, it is hoped that
the versatility of the uses of atomic
energy, as they will be studied under the
Phoenix Project, will be realized.
The information, while restricted to
technical nature, is not intended to be-
little the great importance of the social,
political, and economic problems brought
about by atomic energy.
The Atomic Power Plant
Of its many applications, atomic energy
can find few more promising uses (from
the long-range point of view) than in the
field of industry. There it can be of
paramount importance as a great source
of energy and power. However, its suc-
cessful utilization provides many complex
problems. What will be the shape and
construction of the power producing
units? What of fuel? How will radiation
be coped with? What of the enormous
heat generation? There is also the ques-
tion of measuring devices, of energy con-
version, and of materials used in the
various processes.
The solution of these problems involves
a new type of engineering called nuclear
engineering. At the U. of M., the Depart-
ment of Engineering Mechanics of the
College of Engineering has made definite
preparations for the atom through the
Michigan Memorial—Phoenix Project.
Engineering mechanics previously has
dealt with the effect of forces upon mat-
ter of appreciable size. Now it must
delve, however, into the effects of forces
and reactions involving atomic particles.
It must provide formulas, relations, and
properties of atomic power that will en-
able industry to realize the atomic power
plant as a practical tool. However, nu-
clear engineering cannot be studied
through engineering mechanics alone. The
study obviously will involve planning in
all branches of engineering.
Study of the Power Plant Units
An atomic power plant may be built in
varying sizes, as many modern steam or
gasoline power plants. At Michigan,
problems of design will be studied as ap-
plied to the smaller units. The principal
elements of construction are an atomic re-
actor, boiler compartment, turbine com-
partment, and auxiliaries. The reactor or
heat producer is the only section which
is radically new or different. The remain-
ing sections are common to any coal fired
power plant, and therefore attention must
be focused on the reactor.
This reactor is, in effect, nothing more

Today, 1950, the actual Synchrotron
nears completion . . . often referred to
as Michigan's 300,000,000 volt "race
track" capable of producing radiation
and particles similar to cosmic rays . . .
a valuable research instrument.
than an atomic fuel burning dsvice. Ho v. -
ever, atomic fuel involves no burning;
rather heat is evolved in the processes of
nuclear bombardment and fission. Prob-
lems of design involve (a) most efficient
dimensioning of reactor, (b) method of
fuel entry and outlet, (c) design of ra-
diation and heat resistant structural ele-
ments, (d) connection to energy conver-
sion mechanism, and (e) design of cool-
ing mechanisms. Development and de-
sign will be based on research and trial
and error methods.
The eventual solution of this problem
will provide the skeleton of a compact
and efficient power plant. When this has
been accomplished, the next step will be
to provide suitable fuel composition.
Study of Fuel Composition and
Atomic Reactions
In order to give the power plant maxi-
mum efficiency, a proper fuel must be de-
veloped. It must provide maximum heat
energy and minimum waste. Uranium is
the basic element in atomic disintegration
because of its newly atomic weight. It is
derived from ores of pitchblende. How-
ever, use of uranium isotopes might cause
too rapid depletion of pitchblende re-
servoirs. There are many lesser ores pro-
viding fissionable materials of inferior
quality.
The method of attack will fall into
several categories:
(a) Trial and error
(b) Scientific tabulation of compounds
and heating values
(c) Comparison of availability and
geologic distribution of fuel ores
Study of Radiation Shielding
Once the heat providing process is pro-
vided in a suitably designed container, the
next step is to provide shielding of hu-
mans and other susceptible materials from
the dangerous radiation.
Problems arising for study in this cate-
gory come under the general idea of safety
precautions. Human protection is almost
assured if the assembly shield is adequate.
This shield will surround the entire reac-
tor device and will either absorb or re-
flect the harmful radiation, or both. Fu-
ture work in developing shielding material
would settle many pertinent issues:

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


PHOENIX PROJECT
BY
MARVIN J. LUBECK '51 LS&amp;A
Student Chairman, Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Pro/ecf
The Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Proj-
ect is a student undertaking. It was the
idea of students to have a living me-
morial for the 579 members of the Uni-
versity family who were killed in World
War II. It was a student committee who
pressed the University to action on the
matter, and who urged the regents to
accept the idea of the Phoenix Project
after this idea was approved by a student
group to whom it was first submitted.
When the National Executive Committee
for the Proenix Project was formed, care
was taken to include a student as a mem-
ber of this committee in order to co-ordi-
nate the student campaign with the na-
tional campaign, and in order that the
students be represented in planning the
drive. Throughout the planning of every
phase of the Phoenix Project students
have been very active, and have added
immeasurably to the final product.
The Students' Responsibility
It is no more than fitting that the stu-
dents should play this large role in making
the Phoenix Project drive a success, for
this is a project that concerns all the
members of the University of Michigan
family, and the nearly 20,000 men and
women who are students here now, are
the most immediate members of that fam-
ily. It is the students who are on campus
now, who are the flesh and blood of the
University, and they must carry on what
former students have begun. It is now
the responsibility of the present student
body to do the utmost in making the
Phoenix Project campaign a success.
The Students' Benefit
The student body at the University has
in truth a double interest in the Phoenix
Project. Their first concern lies in seeing
that the drive is a success, that the Michi-
gan Memorial-Phoenix Project becomes a
reality. Their other interest in the Phoe-
nix Project stems from the fact that it is
the generation of today's students and that
of their children who will reap the long
term benefits from the Phoenix Project.
Today's students and their children who
will have a better chance to live without

MARVIN J. LUBECK
fear of such dread diseases as cancer, leu-
kemia, arthritis, and hyperthyroidism.
Doctors, biochemists, and pharmacologists
working together, and pooling their
knowledge and research skill in the Phoe-
nix Project will have a much better op-
portunity to study the causes and cures
for these maladies than they would by
working separately. By the same token
Michigan's engineers, physicists, and
chemists will be finding new ways of
using atomic energy to develop new
products. Engineers will be doing much
of the research to find ways of using
atomic energy to turn the wheels of in-
dustry; and to explore the possibilities of
using atomic energy to power automobiles,
planes, and ships. Such advances as more
efficient communication systems, fresher
and more palatable foods, along with bet-
ter food preserving methods, and greater
soil productivity are in the offing for the
student's generation, and for the genera-
tions to follow. These scientific advance-
ments along with research in the social
sciences on such topics as curriculum
revisions in elementary schools, new
teaching methods in high schools, and
adult education programs, all designed to
prepare the people for life in an Atomic
Age; organizational as well as physical
changes in the structure of businesses;
and the legal aspect of atomic energy con-
trol, will be discussed by the most learned
men in each field who will be brought to
the University of Michigan by the Phoenix
Project. This research, and the discoveries
which issue from it, will better the lives
of those who are now students in three
ways. First, as individuals; second, as
users of industry's new products; and
third, as members of a better society.
The Students' Part in the Drive
The derivation of a better life from
the results of the Phoenix Project is only
one of the two ways in which the students
are connected with the Phoenix Project,
and can only follow after the drive for
funds has been successful. In this drive
the students perform a double function by
giving money themselves, and by stimu-
lating the national drive. The student
body is being asked to raise between
$100,000 and $200,000 for the drive
fund. Approximately 1,500 students have
given time and effort in order to contact
every one of the students now on campus.
As a part of this campus drive a program
of education about the Phoenix Project
has been carried out, and part of this pro-
gram is being used to stimulate the na-
tional campaign, and along with student
enthusiasm and support will aid greatly
in achieving the $6,500,000 national goal.
The Students' Responsibilities
The present student body is playing a
vital part in bringing new distinction to
their University, for the Phoenix Project
is unique among research centers. It
reaches far beyond the traditional scope
of state sponsored education. There is no
provision in the state budget for the re-
search planned by the Phoenix Project,
and so for the first time in its history the
University is turning to its students,
alumni, and friends for money in order
to carry out this plan. A large share of
the responsibility for the success of this
drive rests on the students. They, as the
group who will receive the benefits from
the Project, and as the force which has
seen the Phoenix Project through from
inception to constructive action, must fol-
low their obligation to completion.

DR. ALEXANDER G. RUTHVEN
President of the University of Michigan
"I have repeatedly called the Phoenix Project the most important undertaking
in our University's history. It is even more. At a time when a poisonous ideology
would reduce life itself to a commodity of low value, the Phoenix Project stands as a
trading post where hope can be freely exchanged for fear."
.... "I would also like to point out that the Phoenix Project is no longer a dream.
From preliminary funds that have been contributed by alumni and other friends, we
have already been able to start 20 separate research projects of a fundamental nature.
At a time when the threat of atomic destruction hangs over us, the University is be-
ginning a special study to develop ways and means of protecting human beings against
radiation. This applies not only to the possibility of atomic attack but also to the
thousands of people working daily with radioactive materials."
.... "I am proud of the alumni, faculty members and students of the University
of Michigan for proposing the Phoenix Project. I am proud that our University has
undertaken to do the great humanitarian work it embraces."
CHESTER H. LANG
National Executive Chairman
Michigan Memorial—Phoenix Project
"The Michigan Memorial—Phoenix Project is no ordinary memorial."
"In all the years to come, it will, of course, memorialize the men and women of
Michigan who died in the war. But it is far more than an eternal reminder."
"The Phoenix Project represents a job to be done: a job those men and women
would have wanted done, perhaps above all else. We are honoring them by taking
up the greatest challenge of our time. We are paying tribute to their sacrifice by
accepting a momentous responsibility. Because of our efforts, man may be better able to
handle the cataclysmic force that has been turned loose upon the world—a force that
was born in the same flaming deluge that swept away the lives of those this
project honors."


MARSHALL E. DIMOCK
Former Assistant Secretary of Labor
"The Phoenix Project at the University of Michigan, being the first bold and
constructive effort to focus the potential of both the physical and the social sciences
on the possibilities and problem of the atomic future, deserves the generous support
it is receiving from the public, from industry, the federal government, and the privately
endowed foundations. I know of no place where the great foundations can invest
the funds that have been entrusted to them with greater assurance that they will bear
compound interest in almost every field of human endeavor."
". . . . there is no department or school in a great university like the University
of Michigan that is not, in some way, with differing degrees of importance, involved
in the social uses and problems created by atomic energy. That is why the Phoenix
Project is so imaginative and yet so practical in its design."

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


GENERAL DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
President, Columbia University
"The work planned by your University is a part of the biggest job of our lives—
the battle for freedom." ...
.... "In this kind of contest—and the contest is world-wide in scope and seem-
ingly endless in duration—we must count and husband all of our resources, whether
they arc the product of our hands or of our hearts.
When I say we must husband all our resources, I mean that we must not only be
frugal with what we already possess, but employ what we have to even greater ad-
vantage. All you Michigan men and women are focusing your attention on the plans
of your University for expanded atomic research. Here is a tremendously important
exploitation of our national resources.
Few causes are more urgent today and more noteworthy of your support. I
commend you for your interest in it. . . . Because I believe that, in war or in peace, the
atomic research being done at the University of Michigan, and at many other centers
of learning, will strengthen America through better utilization of its natural resources."


WARREN R. AUSTIN
U. S. Delegate to the United Nations
"This is a grand testimonial to the free way of life. It shows the sense of
individual responsibility of educated men for the expansion of education, the vitality
of voluntary cooperation, the possibilities of private initiative for human welfare. By
your acts you give proof to the world that your university not only informs and instructs
its students, but develops the whole personality, releasing it to function with imagina-
tion in the up-building of a free society." . . .
.... "Your Michigan Memorial—Phoenix Project is designed to accelerate
research on many ways to use atomic energy for constructive ends and to apply the
principles of atomic science. There are many non-dangerous activities in the applica-
tion of atomic theory for constructive purposes. But whenever you are dealing with
the atomic fuel itself in critical quantities, you are inevitably dealing with a powerful
explosive. It can be packaged in a simple bomb-container which can be made in any
machine shop in short order."

.... "Those industries that are first to establish relations with nuclear physics
laboratories in schools, colleges and universities across the country will be the first to
find applications in their own industrial problems." ....
.... "Ever since the end of the war the government aeencies. notablv the AEC
and the Navy, have associated themselves with nuclear physics work in educational
institutions and have made first-hand contacts with students who are getting their
degrees in that field, . . . Industry would do well to develop its own pipe lines to the
sources of trained men and information on radioactive materials. . . . organizations
such as the Phoenix Project offer industries an opportunity to ge an inside track to this
field and get newly trained men."

PROJECT
Michigan's memorial to its 507 stu-
dents and faculty who lost their lives in
World War II actually had its beginning
in June, 1946, at the time of the annual
alumni reunion. After the memorial serv-
ice for its war dead, there was mention
among the alumni that the University
should concern itself with a memorial.
In December of the same year, the student
legislature clearly stated its attitude that
there should not only be a memorial but
that it should be a functional memorial.
Hence, it is obvious that the first concept
of a war memorial was a student-alumni
one.
In May, V947, Professor Karl Litzen-
berg, Dean Charles Peake, Mr. T. Haw-
ley Tapping and the author—all alumni
of the University—met at the Union and
concluded that the time had come to give
serious study to the idea of a memorial.
It was decided to suggest to President
Ruthven that he appoint a committee to
study the problem. The suggestion was
presented to the President September 15,
1947, and upon his recommendation the
Board of Regents, at its meeting of Sep-
tember 29, appointed the following com-
mittee: Robert C. Angell, Roscoe C.
Bonisteel, Arthur R. Der Derian, William
Haber, Christian Matthews, Marvin L.
Niehuss, Arthur M. Rude, E. Virginia
Smith and Erich A. Walter (Chairman).
Mrs. Jacqueline K. Adams acted as secre-
tary to the committee.
It should be noted that the membership
of the committee included three students
(all veterans of World ar II), Miss E.
Virginia Smith ('50LSA) who served as a
nurse in the Pacific area, Mr. Arthur R.
Der Derian (-45-'48) who served as an
aviation cadet, and Mr. Arthur M. Rude
f42LSA-'49LL.B) who served as a first
lieutenant in the Army and who also was
the originator of the Bomber Scholarship
which benefitted 254 veterans during the
academic years 1946 to 1950; two repre-
sentatives of the faculty, Professors Rob-
ert C. Angell and William Haber; one
representative of the Board of Regents,
Mr. Roscoe C. Bonisteel; two representa-
tives of the administration of the Univer-
sity, Vice-President Marvin L. Niehuss

and the Dean of Students.
On October 21, the chairman had the
privilege of meeting in New York, Fred
Smith, an alumnus of the University who
always wants to know "what's cooking"
when he meets someone connected with
the University. Told that a committee had
been appointed to study the question of
a war memorial, he offered a suggestion
which he pursued in a letter that very
evening, addressed to the chairman of the
committee. The following quotations
from his letter clearly indicate his plan:
"Now how can we do something that
will reassure our veterans—that will give
them a measure of confidence that some-
body, at least, is doing something con-
structive? That, it seems to me, is the
starting point from which to consider pos-
sible ways of creating a memorial.
"Certainly the most startling outgrowth
of the recent war was the release of atomic
energy. People are becoming calloused to
the idea that the harnessing of atomic
energy is the crucial achievement of man-
kind: it can eliminate civilization, or can
provide the means of building a civiliza-
tion that outstrips anything in any sane
man's imagination.
"It is my feeling that the University
might take unto itself the administration
and coordination of research in some spe-
cific phase of peacetime atomic research
and construct a building to house the
administrative and scientific staff necessary
to do this coordinating job. It is my
feeling that only a fragment of the work
would be done at the University, and
that the chief function would be to co-
ordinate the literally hundreds of thous-
ands of doctors (if we choose this par-
ticular phase of atomic research) who are
now experimenting with isotopes through-
out the world.
"But the organization of this memorial
should go beyond the building. It should
include the maintenance of the adminis-
trative staff," which would be closely co-
ordinated with the government's Atomic
Commission. Moreover, one student
should be chosen every four years or so
to become a lifetime worker in this field.
He could be an outstanding student in
research, in administration, or in any of
the fields vital to the practical operation
of this perpetual research and develop-
ment project. The student would be care-
fully picked, and should agree to give their
lives, or a substantial portion of their
lives, to the pursuit of the betterment of
mankind through research achievements
in this field—and should be given lifetime
jobs free of financial worry.
"In the first place, I believe that the
Government would make available funds
and equipment to maintain such a project,
if the initiative and original investment
were taken by the University. At least to
my knowledge, there has never been a life
time project such as this devised; about
the only organized effort at the present
time that permits people to dedicate their
lives is the church; and it is not far-fetch-
ed to say that the pursuit of atomic re-
search is as vital to the future of mankind
as the continuation of religion; and the
devotion of the people involved in it
should be no less unstinted.
"I think that a foundation set up in
this way would have such strong appeal,
and would achieve such public support,
that the Atomic Commission would have
little trouble securing money from Con-
gress to help support it. If Senator Van-
denberg could be interested in this proj-
ect, and it is my belief that he could, he

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

DEAN IVAN C. CRAWFORD
College of Engineering
University of Michigan
Developments
In Decembsr of 1948 the Standing
Committee of the college appointed a
special committee, the Nuclear Engineer-
ing Committee, "to make a study
and report on the subject of Nuclear
Engineering, covering such questions as:
Is there such a field as nuclear engineer-
ing? If so, how may it be denned, how
differentiated from physics, and what sub-
jects should be included in a program of
study."
In its report the Committee stated that
the term " Nuclear Engineering' is now
used to include all phases of applied sci-
ence which are involved in the design,
construction and operation of nuclear re-
actors to produce power or useful radio-
isotopes, of radiochemical plants to re-
cover the full material or by-products and
of waste storage and disposal systems."
The committee recommended that pro-
grams be established in this field leading
to graduate degrees in several of the engi-
neering departments. A beginning course,
Elements of Nuclear Engineering, was de-
veloped and placed in operation for the
first time during the present semester.
Other courses—Instrumentation of Nu-
clear Energy, with laboratory, Storage and
Disposal of Radioactive Materials—will
follow.
The beginning course is limited to a
small number of seniors and graduate stu-
dents.
A final course in nuclear engineering,
as the program now stands, is Nuclear
Engineering Practice School. The com-
mittee in its second report notes that "one
of the basic difficulties in offering a suit-
able program in Nuclear Engineering is
the exceedingly high cost and inaccessi-
bility of radio-active materials and equip-
ment suitable for handling such mater-
ials." The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology has set up an Engineering
Practice School at Oak Ridge in the atomic
energy installations operated by the Car-
bide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation.
M. I. T. admits to this practice school
graduate students from other universities.
Credit earned there would apply toward
the degree at the student's home institu-
tion. The committee strongly recommends
that the University of Michigan partici-
pate in this program.
Opportunities
At the present time this field does not
offer the number of job opportunities pre-
sented in even the less populous engineer-
ing fields. Without doubt nuclear engi-
neering will furnish more employment to
especially qualified engineers as larger
numbers of industries participate in the
Atomic Energy Commission program.
Presently this program is largely confined
to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories,
the General Electric plutonium plant at
Richland, Washington, the Oak Ridge in-
stallation, Argonne National Laboratories,
theKnoll's Atomic Power Laboratory of
the General Electric Company, and the
Brookhaven National Laboratory; also
several other laboratories operated by pri-
vate corporations under contact with the
Atomic Energy Commission. In addition
to the opportunities present in these or-
ganizations, mining engineers find em-
ployment in searching for, mining, and
concentrating uranium ore, and other
engineers engage in the development and
manufacture of radiation instruments.
Those really interested in nuclear engi-
neering and willing to spend the neces-
sary time in graduate work, will in all
probability, find plenty of opportunities.
Effects of the Atom
A publication by this name prepared
under the direction of the Los Alamos
Scientific Laboratory has become a best
seller. Without doubt, all engineers
should be familiar with the subject mat-
ter treated in this book because they, as
members of the engineering profession,
are expected to know about the effects of
these weapons and the measures which
may be taken to reduce and perhaps
counteract the effects.
The chapter headings indicate clearly
the several divisions under which the
subject matter is treated. These are: Prin-
ciples of an Atomic Explosion, Descrip-
tion of an Atomic Explosion, Shock from
Air Burst, Shock from Underwater and
Underground Bursts, Physical Damage
(From Air Blast, Ground and Under-
water Shock), Thermal Radiation and In-
cendiary Effects, Initial Nuclear Radia-
tions, Residual Nuclear Radiations, De-
contamination, Effects on Personnel, and
lastly, Protection of Personnel.
Engineers who are engaged in the de-
sign of structures in areas which may be-
come targets must take into consideration
the forces unleashed in an atomic explo-
sion. It is stated that "there were no
reinforced-concrete buildings of earth-
quake-resistant design in Nagasaki that
suffered serious damage to the frame at
distances of 2,000 feet or more" from a
spot immediately beneath the bomb ex-
plosion.
All engineers and other persons con-
cerned with civilian defense will be in-
terested in the information presented rela-
tive to radiation phenomena.

BY
GORDON DEAN
Chairman, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
The Atomic Energy Commission salutes
the Phoenix Project of the University of
Michigan and wishes that it may flourish.
Atomic energy development on its indus-
trial side is in the main a Government
monopoly. This has come about because
the fissionable materials that are the
basis of an atomic energy industry have to
be kept in public custody and under
public management to safeguard the se-
curity of this nation.
But the accomplishing of this necessary
end should not, must not bar private ini-
tiative in atomic energy research, nor free
academic inquiry seeking policies and
practices that will best guide the public
and private use of atomic energy.
We wholeheartedly welcome Michigan's
lead toward more privately-financed
atomic energy research in unclassified
fields. This is basic to speedy progress.
These ultimately most important deci-
sions on atomic energy will be made by
the people in our democracy. Through
such studies as the Phoenix Project is get-
ting underway in economics, political sci-
ence, psychology and the other social
disciplines the work of the scholars will
light the way to sound decisions by their
fellow-citizens.
A Resource
These special contributions to progress
are over and beyond the primary service
of universities to the nation—the training
of the technical manpower on whom we
so utterly depend for success in waging
war and advance in the arts of peace.
Scientists and engineers are a national
resource of major importance. It is im-
perative that we make sensible, effective
use of their skills.
One consideration is to see that we
"keep the seed corn coming" for future
growth and development by maintaining
in full vigor, year-in-year-out, in wartime
as well as in peacetime, the staff for sci-
entific training in the universities. The
corollary of this is that we also maintain
the flow into the universities of the talent-
ed youngsters who can carry scientific and
engineering training over to new accom-
plishment.
Times of emergency require that special

thought be given to ways and means of
making the best use of the scientific man-
power already on hand. The activities of
any mobilization or war period make
heavy drains on the technical economy of
the nation. The needs of such times re-
quire that the men of science be so ap-
portioned as to make their maximum con-
tribution to the war effort. It is essential
to follow general policies and specific pro-
cedures that will insure the effective dis-
tribution of scientists to all categories of
the national economy. Hand in hand with
this procedure, industry, education, the
Armed Services need to take care to insure
that the supply of scientists in each line
of work reaches as far as possible in the
same way that they would conserve any
other valuable and scarce resource.
Research
One of the contributions of scientists in
wartime, as in peacetime, is the carrying
on of basic research. Now, arguing the
relative merits of applied versus pure re-
search is one of the most fruitless occu-
pations known to man. Actually, and
particularly in a field developing as rapid-
ly as atomic energy, the distinction is
vague. The president of a leading eastern
university recently announced that after
many years devoted to study of this
question he had found the answer. "Ap-
plied research," he said, "was that for
which it was easy to get money."
While this may be true, it is also true
that nowadays the lag between discovery
and use of knowledge has all but disap-
peared. That is one reason why it is
hard to draw the line between basic and
applied research.
Fifteen years ago no field of scientific
study appeared of less practical interest
than the chemistry of the rare earths. This
wayward group of elements did not fit
properly into the periodic table. Closely
allied in chemical properties, they were
extremely difficult to separate from one
another. Even graduate students were dis-
couraged from working in a field which
so obviously led nowhere.
Fortunately, a few men persisted in
rare-earths research and during the war
their work paid off. It just so happened
that the rare earths were among the most
abundant products created in the fission
of uranium 235. Plutonium, itself closely
allied to the rare earths, is associated with
them in the uranium slugs taken from the
reactors at Hanford. Today rare earth
chemistry is probably the most important
process in the plutonium industry.
Canning Problem
Another example occurred here at
Michigan. For many years Dr. Floyd
Firestone, now in Washington, was a
member of the physics staff of this Uni-
versity. His primary interest law in the
field of accoustics and ultra-high-frequency
sound waves. Again it so happened that
one of the most troublesome problems in
building the Hanford plutonium reactors
was the canning of the uranium slugs.
This had to be done to prevent deadly
radioactive materials from getting into
the cooling water and atmosphere.
Through his studies of ultrasonic pro-
pagation in metals, Dr. Firestone was
able to detect defects in the bond between
the slug and the can. During the hectic
period when scientists at the Metallurgical
Laboratory in Chicago were trying to lick
the canning problem, they turned to Fire-
stone, and his special technique gave the
clue to the answers.
We use nuclear reactions to produce
energy but our knowledge of the force
that holds nuclei together is scanty and

of ore to obtain uranium but the methods
of processing used are empirical and many
of the chemical and physical details that
effect them are little understood. Almost
every step in our entire program from
digging the ores out of the ground to
exploding bombs and designing power
reactors bristles with questions, the an-
swers to which we do not know.
Let me, in brief, stress these two gen-
eral points: First, that our scientific man-
power must be regarded and employed as
a national resource; second, that in such
times as these, it is important to continue
to increase, rather than to decrease our
fundamental research. I state these prin-
ciples with a conviction that grows from
study of the history of atomic energy de-
velopment. As I've indicated, the atomic
energy program at the start may fairly
be said to have sprung full panoplied
from the brains of university research
men. Atomic energy history points up
strikingly the debt of the people of the
country to the universities of the country.
Our strength lies not simply in our
weapons; it lies, at the core, in our under-
standing of the forces of nature. The
Phoenix Project of the University of
Michigan will, I am sure, contribute to
that knowledge and thus increase our
strength.
Government Control
There are some who ask: Why doesn't
the public treasury finance all research
on atomic energy? Why ask for private
funds to support such work?
The complete answers, like answers to
all broad policy questions, are complex.
But at the risk of over-simplifying, let
me state some general considerations that
seem pertinent to me.
First of all, it is obvious that research
that under the Atomic Energy Act must
be kept secret has to be controlled and
financed by Government.
Secondly, a considerable body of fun-
damental research which gives prospect of
applying sometime to the solution of
problems in the atomic energy industry,
but does not need to be kept secret in its
early stages at least, still should be fi-
nanced by Government. This we are
doing. We have in force more than 100
contracts with universities, hospitals, re-
search institutes for carrying on such
research. It forms a part of the programs
in the national laboratories built and
financed by the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion. This phase of the Government-
financed program, as I have indicated in
my earlier remarks requires to be main-
tained and, indeed strengthened continu-
ously now and in the future. Emergency
points up the need to press ahead with
basic research that gives a lead into the
solution of urgent technical problems.
Thirdly, there is the general field of
study in the basic laws of nature that
govern atomic phenomena of all sorts.
This is the "pure" type of research. At
its beginning it seems to have no relation
to the solution of production and operat-
ing problems. But as I have stated earlier,
time and again the facts and theories that
it produces have made possible sweeping
advance in technology.
Some of this research requires machines
of great size and cost—cost past the
capacity of private financing. Govern-
ment has taken on the building of such
machines—particle accelerators at uni-
versities and national laboratories, re-
actors at national laboratories. Govern-
ment also operates these machines and
finances some of the work done with
them. The machines are available also for
the use of independent researchers, as in
the case of the reactors just coming into
operation at Brookhaven National Lab-
oratory.
But there is much research out on these
frontiers of physical, chemical, biological
and medical knowledge which can be
carried on with equipment that is within
the reach of privately-financed or State
institutions. This is the field where indi-
vidual gifts and current State appropria-
tions can and should broaden the scope
and stimulate the spirit of free, indepen-
dent inquiry into natural phenomena and
the laws to which they conform. I believe
that on reflection no one who cherishes
the traditions that have built the sciences
would wish to put all or even a major
part of basic research in any field com-
pletely in the hands of the central Gov-
ernment. To do so would in the end slow
our progress and leave us a very different
people.
In short, there is much that can and
should be done in atomic energy research
by universities, individuals, and private
institutes, and that should not be con-
trolled or paid for by Government. Those
who contribute to the support of such
research are truly serving America.
Atomic energy products—the stable
and radioactive isotopes—play a part of
rapidly growing importance in research
on problems of the life sciences, including
those dealing with health and agricultural
production. Here, again, the Atomic
Energy Commission feels an obligation to
carry on some special projects which can
be best managed and operated at the in-
stallations in the program, and to give
aid to hundreds of research institutions
through providing special equipment and
materials that are not available to them
from other sources. Let me cite two ex-
amples—research in cancer and research
in soils and fertilizers as related to im-
proving crop production.
Radioactive Phosphorus
Because few agricultural experiment sta-
tions now have facilities for mixing radio-
active phosphorus with fertilizers, the
AEC is currently financing the making of
such research materials by the United
States Department of Agriculture at its
Beltsville, Maryland, research center.
During the current year this radioactive
material for soils research has been sent
to 22 state agricultural experiment sta-
tions for use in 67 different studies. The
studies were financed by the stations.
According to the director of this pro-
gram, more has been learned in the past
four years about phosphate fertilizers than
had been achieved by other means in the
previous 50 years.
Some 15 million tons of phosphate fer-
tilizer costing over $300,000,000 are used
yearly in this country. Efficient use of
phosphates is extremely important to farm-
ers. Among the questions to which the
research people are finding answers are
these:
How do crops vary in their use of fer-
tilizer phosphates?
What soil conditions promote good
use of phosphorus?
How do various types of phosphate fer-
tilizers compare?
How do plants utilize phosphates?
Through use of radiophosphorus the ex-
perimenters have learned that potatoes
take up phosphorus from the added fer-
tilizer throughout the growing season.
Young corn will take up fertilizer phos-
phate but the older plant obtains most
of its phosphorus from that fixed in the
soil. The research men believe this may
suggest that potatoes should be heavily
fertilized before and during the growing
season; while for corn the best practice
might be to apply phosphorus as long as
a year before the growing season; to raise
gradually the phosphate level of the soil
by long-time application of less soluble
phosphates which will not leach out.
These suggestions of course must be
tried out before they are established as
fact and put into farming practice.

KENNETH P. CHASE '52E
With the advent of the Atom Bomb
the world's thinking people realized that
there was a new and powerful scientific
tool available to them—radioactivity.
As always, however, with the passage of
time the period of prognostication rises
and falls and it is then that progress be-
gins to appear. It has appeared and is
now appearing in such places as the lab-
oratories of the University of Michigan
and will likely appear in the laboratories
of the Phoenix Project.
Applications
There are two known possible applica-
tions of radioactivity: The production of
usable energy for commercial purposes
and the implementation of radio-active
particles for purposes of research. The
latter is being attacked by workers in the
Phoenix laboratories.
In these laboratories an attempt is be-
ing made to further eliminate the barriers
of scientific knowledge; learn facts about
the phenomena that cause the known ac-
tions and reactions; and perhaps even to
identify and define the basic unit of all
things if there is such a unit.
It is well known that the smallest par-
ticle about which there can be true scien-
tific knowledge is the smallest particle
that can be examined with accuracy.
Therefore, the devices and processes that
may be used for examining the unknown
are the main limitations of science. The
struggle now is to improve these devices
and methods and in so doing, lower the

trical Engineering Department and plans

Prior to entering the U. of M., Ken served

The material he uses in this article was
obtained largely from Dr. Henry J. Gom-
berg, Director of the Phoenix Project
Laboratories. Dr. Gomberg has pioneer-
ed research in this field and is recog-
nized as an authority in radioactivity
research.

size limits of examination, thus increas-
ing the store of knowledge and perhaps
improving the world for peaceful living.
The conquest of this problem is one of the
aims of those working under the auspices
of the Phoenix Project. Here are a few
facts about the labors and immediate aims
of these Phoenix scientists.
Examination
First of all, an immediate objective is to
accurately examine the structures that we
now think of as comparatively basic, such
as individual crystals and cells.
An accurate and thorough knowledge
of the human cell would be a great ad-
vancement in the search for such things
as a cure for cancer. The main problem
confronting these now searching for this
cure is to find a unique characteristic of
the cancerous cell that will enable them
to combat it without injuring desirable
cells. Also, if such a knowledge of the
many types of crystalline structure could
be obtained, it would mean a great ad-
vancement in the science of metallurgy.
For example, an accurate knowledge of
the distribution of carbon in steel crystals
could go far toward clarifying and con-
firming the metallurgists' theories. For
the sake of interest, the size of the average
cell is somewhere around 5 x 10"° meters.
It is therefore obvious that to examine its
structure we must be able to discern even
smaller dimensions. A crystal may be as
small as 10 angstrom units (1 angstrom =
10"10 meter) across, which is thus consid-
erably smaller than the average cell size.
If these tiny structures are to be ex-
amined accurately there must be available
devices or processes with a high enough
degree of resolution to be able to dis-
tinguish between points and quantities
separated by the minute distances by which
the component parts of these structures
are separated.
The limit of the resolution of light
microscopy is absolutely y2 the wave
length of the color of light used. This
is in the order of 10-7 meters. As yet
methods have not been developed to use
light microscopy to its limit, but recent ad-
vancements have approached this limit
closely.
Even in the limit, however, it can be
seen that light microscopy is not enough.
This is where the phenomenon of radio-
activity is utilized. This is the one appli-
cation thus far for evident where radio-ac-
tive materials can be used to greater ad-
vantage than anything else.
Autoradiography
The particles emitted by radio-active
substances are parts of nuclei of atoms,
hence are even smaller than atomic dimen-
sions. If a way could be found to detect
accurately the movements and locations of
these particles to within limits comparable
to atomic and molecular dimensions the
limits of examination would have been
lowered a great deal. The detection of
these particles is officially known as auto-
radiography and is the specialty of Dr.
Henry J. Gomberg, director of labora-
tories for the Phoenix Project.
Dr. Gomberg has recently developed a
method of detecting active particles by
light microscopy which is the recent ad-
vance mentioned earlier. It is very in-
genious and is an excellent example of
the progress that is being made by the
Phoenix laboratories.
As mentioned previously the objective
of this process is to examine accurately the
basic structure such as cells and crystals.
To do so it makes use of precision micro-
scope photography.
Radioactive Iodine
An example of the manner in which it
is used is the tracing of the radio-isotope
of iodine in the thyroid gland.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



IN OCTOBER the first Prestressed-Concrete Bridge in the United States
was put in service. Its roadway, designed for a 15-ton load, was of an
entirely new design which permitted amazing speed of construction and
cost only $2.00 per square foot. With the experience gained, it is esti-
mated that similar spans to be built will be erected in five days —ready
for traffic in 14 days —and at an even lower cost.
The span is m&amp;de up of beams formed of machine-made concrete blocks
laid horizontally with mortar joints. Two Roebling Prestressed-Concrete
Galvanized Strands running through longitudinal holes in the blocks were
placed under tension, converting each beam into" a self-contained mono-
lithic concrete unit. After the beams were erected in place, the span was
covered with a continuous, mesh-reinforced concrete slab and laterally
prestressed when the concrete had cured to strength.
Americanized Prestressed-Concrete, employing special cold drawn steel
wire and specially designed fittings, is an exclusive Roebling development.
It makes available a new construction material with an exceptional strength-
weight ratio... a material economical in itself and a real time-saver! Its
potentials quickly recognized, it has already been adopted in several
structures, including use for floors and roof of a large commercial building
how under construction.
The Roebling engineering staff is ready to help your engineers work out
problems connected with new applications for Prestressed-Concrete.

The central economic question which
the prospect of atomic power poses is:
given a change in the cost and availability
of energy, what economic consequences
will in all probability ensue for different
industries and different regions of the
world.
A comprehensive and tenable answer
to this central question is imperative for
at least two reasons. In the first place,
how fast and how energetically a nation
in fact overcomes the large and expensive
technical difficulties that now impede the
realization of the dream of atomic power
is at least partially a function of how
high are the nation's expectations of the
probable economic benefits of atomic
power. If great expectations exist, then
one can anticipate an energetic and speedy
development; conversely, a generally pre-
vailing opinion that the economic poten-
tial is limited will be conducive to a lei-
surely and slow development effort.
In the second place, once the technical
difficulties are overcome, there will arise
a whole host of specific political-economic
questions on the most proper utilization
of the innovation. For example: (1) if
the industry continues to be a public
monopoly, what pricing policy should be
pursued, where within the United States
should atomic power plants be located;
(2) can and should the industry be re-
organized so that it ceases to be a public
monopoly; (3) should atomic power
plants and atomic power fuel and tech-
nology be exported and if so to what
countries and under what conditions. The
answer to each of these questions will
largely depend on the nature and content
of one's conceptions as to the probably
economic consequences of atomic power.
For example, a decision to locate an
atomic power plant in the New England
area will be strongly influenced by what
one anticipates will be the economic con-
sequences of a reduction of power costs
and an increase of power availability first,
on the level and character of economic ac-
tivity in the New England area and, sec-
ondly, what will be the induced effects
of this change in economic activity in the
New England area or other areas in the
country. Similarly, the decision to export
either plants, fuel, or technology to a
country.

JOSEPH LOFTUS
Despite the obvious and apparent com-
pelling character of these two reasons for
economic research on atomic energy, the
five years since Hiroshima have elicited
only scant activity on the part of profes-
sional economists. In all this time less
than two dozen monographic studies of
any professional significance have been
prepared in this country and in England.
This poverty of attention by those en-
gaged in economic research is commonly
misconceived to be the result of a scarcity
of quantative data. Typically it is em-
phasized that until such time as a few
nuclear power plants are in fact in opera-
tion providing sound experimental data
on the physical and cost characteristics of
atomic power, no really useful economic
studies can be developed.
While it is no doubt true that in recent
years many individual economists have
refrained from engaging in research on
atomic power economics because of a
conviction that there is an insufficiency of
quantitative data, it is the contention of
this observer that this emphasis on the
necessity for numerical data (especially
data on the precise costs of atomic
power) betrays a misconception of the
fundamental problem. The solution of
the central economic question posed by the
advent of atomic power will basically re-
quire two things: (1) a knowledge of
what atomic power costs and availability
will eventually be, and (2) a methodol-
ogy for tracing out what the economic
effects of such a change in costs and avail-
ability will produce in a highly complex
and interdependent world economy. Of
the two requirements the latter is by far
a much greater impediment to reliable
forecasting of the economic consequences
of the atomic power innovation than the
former. As will be pointed out subse-
quently, the problem of what atomic
power costs and availability will be can be
disposed of quite easily for the present
research purposes.
To state the matter in a blunter fashion,
if atomic power were today a reality and
ample data on costs and availability of
atomic power were readily available, the
difficulties and barriers to economic re-
search on the consequences of the innova-
tion would not be significantly less than
they are in fact today even in the ab-
sence of such data. This is maintained for
the very simple reason that the task of
predicting the economic consequences of
an innovation is a task which economists
are in the normal course of events not
prepared to undertake. This is the sort of
problem with which an economist by his
tradition and training is not concerned.
By and large, the bulk of traditional eco-
nomic analysis has proceeded on the as-
sumption that either there has been, or
will be, no significant change in technol-
ogy, or that technological change takes
place so slowly and imperceptibly that for
any given short run analysis it can safely
be disregarded as a causation factor. Sel-
dom, if ever, has the professional econom-
ist addressed himself to the question of
forecasting or "estimating" the effects on
a highly interdependent world economy
of a substantial change in technology.
In this connection, it is interesting to
observe that by and large the varying
opinions on the economic consequences of
atomic power developed in the meagre
studies to date result not so much from
divergent assumptions with respect to the
cost of atomic power as they result from
the methodological differences.
If then, it is valid to insist that the
methodological problem is a much stickier
impediment to realistic appraisals of the
probable impact of atomic power, it is
similarly valid to maintain that this prob-
lem need not and indeed cannot wait for
the actual technical development of atomic

PRELUDE TO A SQUARE MEAL Today, about 12} -j' '&lt;■ of our population works on farms and ranches, supplying food for America and

on the manufacturer's part to keep the
container's contents pure and safe.
Last year, 53,592,563,699 of these

shielded?
(b) What will be the composition of
the shield for minimum weight, so
as to be applicable to portable

the nuclear fuel require any special
form of shield treatment?
(d) What will be the hazards in re-

Study of Heat Transfer and Radiation
After the heat energy has been derived
from the reactor it must be conveyed to
the boiler section to turn water into steam
and eventual mechanical or electrical
energy. The energy may possibly be trans-
ferred directly to a specialized turbine.
Heat transfer materials must withstand
very high temperatures, and they must be
creep resistant and corrosion resistant.
The actual heat transfer medium must be
non-radioactive and stable at high tem-
peratures, i.e. The requirement of high
conductivity, rapid heat flow, limits the.
tramfer medium mainly to liquid metals.
The following are the conditions to be
met; there are many methods of attack:
(a) Determine permanent alteration of
properties such as atomic make-up,
strength, elasticity, dimensions and
conductivity.
(b) Determine alteration of proper-
ties that change only while radia-
tion is present, such as creep and
chemical reactions.
(c) Determine properties of liquid
metals as heat conveyors while
under radioactive stress and high
temperature, their suitability to
forced convection.
(d) Compute heat transfer coefficients
from selected solid materials to
liquid metals.
(e) Investigate new type alloy ma-
terials with extremely high melt-
ing points.
Also included will be work on equip-
ment to pump and handle radioactive
fluids both during heat transfer and re-
moval.
Study of Measuring Devices and
Controls
The atomic power plant because of its
revolutionary operation requires special-
ized instruments for the measurement and
control of the mechanical state of its com-

produced over 100 rare isotopes.
ponent materials. There must be some
means to measure velocities and strains
below the surface of the shielding mater-
ials and inside the reactor. To accomplish
this it would be necessary to develop new
techniques and methods of measurement
and to adapt existing instruments to new
purposes.
The use of radioisotopes emitting
counter-radiation from within the speci-
mens offers a possibility of performing
these measurements. These measurements,
if accurate, will indicate the temperature
of reaction, rate of heat transfer, and rate
of creep and failure of the materials.
Study of Power Conversion Mechanisms
The heat energy which is being carried
by the liquid metal must be transmitted
either to the heating of water or directly
to the operation of a turbine. The big
problem, naturally, is how. The follow-
ing are a few methods to be considered
and tested:
(a) Use of heating coils to provide a
uniform and circulatory heating
effect at high velocity.
(b) System of pre-cooling the liquid
metal before heat transfer is af-
fected.
(c) System of a counter-current flow
heat exchanger, and superchargers.
Once this is effected, the transfer into
mechanical and electrical energy is rela-
tively simple.
Fossil Age Determination
One important application of atomic
energy which is already in operation at the
U. of M. under a grant from the Phoenix
Project is the determination of fossil age
by radioactivity measurements. The work
on this newly-developed method for de-
termining the ages of prehistoric remains
by their content of radioactive Carbon-14
is under the direction of H. R. Crane, pro-
fessor of physics. Professor Crane, who is
noted for his direction of the construction
of the University's 300-million-volt syn-
chrotron, heads a Phoenix Project staff
which is measuring the radioactivity of
relics. These relics are furnished by Pro-
fessor James Griffon of the anthropology
department of the U. of M. The relics
are mainly North American in origin,
consisting of bones, charcoal, and shells
left behind by the Indians.
Radioactive carbon 14, produced in the
laboratory by nuclear bombardment in
cyclotrons or in atomic piles, is found in
all living organisms, including human
beings. It has a half life of five thous-
and years; in other words it is only half
as radioactive after five thousand years.
The carbon 14 taken in during life is not
renewed but decays slowly after death.
Radioactivity of a weight of carbon from
organic matter five thousand is half that
from carbon in living organisms. Hence,
the age of a fossilized wooden tool,
weapon, or piece of charcoal can be found
by measuring the radioactivity of the ob-
ject. The age can be determined within
100 years for objects up to 25,000 years
old.
Radioactive carbon 14 is being pro-
duced incessantly as the neutrons formed
by cosmic rays strike nitrogen atoms in the
earth's atmosphere. Because the earth is
approximately two and a half billion years
old, the atmosphere reached a state of ra-
dioactive equilibrium ages ago. Therefore
carbon 14 is produced at a rate equal to
the rate of decay. This decay is the result
of the loss of a beta particle (electron),
and a beta particle can be detected by a
sensitive Geiger counter. A sensitive
enough counter was invented by Dr. James
Arnold of the University of Chicago,

where this method was first developed by
Professor Libby.
Experiments conducted at the Univer-
sity of Chicago have shown a number
of interesting facts. Charcoal excavated
from hearts and cremation pits of the old-
est known Indian villages in the area
showed that the Indians inhabited New
York State as long ago as 3000 B.C. This
is three thousand years before they were
previously thought to have entered the
Hudson River valley. The Pyramid of the
Sun at Teotihuacan, Mexico, dates from
only 1000 B.C., not 13,000 as it was form-
erly believed. The last Ice Age in the
Midwest reached its height 12,000 years
ago as opposed to the earlier theory that
the peak occurred 20,000 years ago.
U. of M. Apparatus
The apparatus at Michigan, located on
the first floor of the Chemistry Building,
is being operated by Earl McDaniel, a
graduate physics student, and Gloria
Thornton, who has a master's degree in
chemistry. The apparatus is about four
feet high, six feet long, and three feet
wide. In the very center of the apparatus
is what is known as the Libby screenwall
counter, a tungsten wire .006 in. in diam-
eter carrying an electric charge of 1200
volts surrounded by thirty-two copper
wires each with a charge of 45 volts.
Around the Libby screenwall counter goes
a hollow cylinder coated on the inside
with carbon from the sample to be tested.
The hollow cylinder is surrounded by
fifteen anticoincidence Geiger counters to
cancel the effects of cosmic rays. All this
is enclosed by an iron and lead housing
weighing about four tons. The lead is on
the outside to block the radioactivity from
room objects and also to reduce the num-
ber of cosmic rays passing through. The
iron is on the inside to stop the radiation
caused by impurities in the lead. The Gei-
ger counters are attached to an oscillo-
graph which records the number of radio-
active emissions.
The carbon from the sample is burned
to form carbon dioxide. This is reduced
to carbon with magnesium. After several
complicated steps all the impurities are
removed leaving the pure carbon. It is
then mixed with an agar solution form-
ing a gel which will adhere to the inside
of the cylinder.
Three cylinders are in the apparatus at
one time: one contains carbon that is in-
(Continued from page 28)
finitely old, such as coal; another has in it
carbon from an organism which has just
died; the third can contains the carbon
of unknown age. The radioactive emis-
sions from each can are counted for an
hour at a time; then the cans are auto-
matically alternated so that another can is
being counted during the next hour. Thus
in the period of forty-eight hours that the
group of three cans is being tested each
is counted sixteen hours.
Safe Handling
Although it is expected that much good
will be derived from Phoenix Project ac-
tivities on campus, the project also brings
with it several problems. One of the most
outstanding of these problems is how to
minimize the dangers that are ever-present
in the handling and storage of radioactive
materials.
The three major aspects of this problem
are:
1. The protection of personnel using
the active materials.
2. Storage of the active material until
needed.
3. Transporting the materials.
Obviously the aspect of prime importance
is the first.
Protection
When active materials are deposited
in the body, any or all of a great many
ill-effects may result, such as change in
the functions of the organs or fatal burns.
Perhaps the worst feature common to all
effects is that they may not appear until
the dangerous materials has resided in the
body for many years and irreparable dam-
age may have been produced. There usual-
ly are no definite clinical symptoms which
can be relied upon to guard against pos-
sible impending injury.
Since radioactive particles may enter
into or attack the body in several ways it
can be readily seen that safety must be of
primary concern to anyone anticipating
the use of these materials. Among the
precautions that may be taken for the
protection of personnel is the use of safety
devices such as shields that will absorb
active particles, and monitoring devices,
such as film badges, that record the degree
of a person's exposure to radioactivity.
Also, laboratory workers must follow
strict experimental procedures established
on the basis of the utmost in safety. Per-
sonnel working in positions of possible
exposure must practice personal safety
precautions and if necessary submit to
periodic examinations more or less strin-
gent as the individual case may warrant.
There is, under certain conditions, con-
siderable danger of workers carrying ra-
dioactive particles out of the laboratory
in such places as under the fingernails and
in the hair. These possibilities could be,
for the most part, eliminated if the work-
ers followed carefully planned routines
of personnel hygiene.
Storage Problem
The storage problem, though not as
involved as the handling problem is still
cause for concern.
Since it is not practical to activate ma-
terials as they are needed, quantities of
them must be stored until used. This re-
quires well protected storage facilities in a
close proximity to the place of use. Also,
there must be some means of regulating
the removal of active materials from their
storage space. Whoever is given the re-
sponsibility of regulation must know at all
times where every millicurie of activity is
and how it is being used.
In some cases there is radioactive waste
from the use of active materials. There
must be facilities to destroy this waste or
store it until the period of dangerous
activity has elapsed. This period is gen-
erally considered to be the half-life of the
element which is as much as fifty-five days
for Strontium 89, as commonly used radio-
active material.
Transportation
The last problem mentioned, transpor-
tation, can be a considerable worry if the
proper facilities are not available and
proper procedures not followed. Radio-
active materials, just as any other material
must be moved both from laboratory to
laboratory and from place to place within
a laboratory. This could very easily in-
volve the handling of the materials by
people inexperienced and not properly in-
doctrinated in such work. Strict proce-
dures involving packaging and handling
must be instituted and inforced.
Now that the necessity for proper safety
precautions has been established, what is
being done about it? President Ruthven
has appointed a committee of seven men,
including those men on campus who are
best informed on the subject, to weigh

to get a broad engineering background.
I joined the Allis-Chalmers Graduate

the aspects of the problem and set up the
many rules and regulations that are neces-
sary. This committee has just recently
been chosen and hence, at this printing
is still in the organizational stage. No
definite policy has been decided upon as
yet.
Other Engineering Proposals to Phoenix
The foregoing examples of the use of
atomic energy are, of course, but three of
the many proposed research projects con-
nected with the Michigan Memorial—
Phoenix Project. Due to the fact that
many of the other engineering proposals
are yet in the problematical stage and
have not yet been pursued with the details
of these first proposals, the other proposals
may only be indicated here.
For example, the Department of Chemi-
cal and Metallurgical Engineering has
suggested the following research projects
along with their possible application:
1. Development of a method for meas-
uring particle sizes and concentration in
smokes and sprays. This method is based
on the light scattering properties of spheri-
cal particles. Application: Elimination of
radioactive mists in stack gases.
2. High pressure, high temperature
chemical reactions. Application: Synthe-
sis of new fuels; design of equipment for
withstanding severe conditions of opera-
tion.
3. Investigation of the streaming po-
tential phenomena in the flow of fluids
through small tubes. Application: Meas-
urement of the rate of flow of blood in
arteries and veins.
4. A study of the effect of concentra-
tion of proteins, salts and other substances
in blood plasma on the rate of diffusion
through cell walls. Application: A bet-
ter understanding of diffusional processes
in the human body may result in cures
for cancer, edema, and others.
5. The construction of a mechanical
kidney. Application: Increased knowledge
on the functioning of the kidney and pos-
sible cure for its ailments.
6. Development of x-ray technique for
measuring concentration of calcium in
bones. Application: Prevention of decal-
cification of bones during pregnancy or
during recovery from bone fractures.
Other Proposals
Still other suggestions include the fol-
lowing:
A—"Simple" engineering gadgets
(1) Pinhole detector in thin metal
sheet, using low energy beta radiation
source and Geiger Counter or ionization
chamber detector.
(2) "Memory" for calculator or other
device requiring information storage
using a neutron source and a wire or tape
with high capture cross section which be-
comes radioactive.
(3) Non contact punch card "feeler"
using low energy beta radiation to indi-
cate presence of hole in card.
(4) Smoke or vapor alarm based on
capture or scatter of beta radiation by
heavy particles in air.
(5) Study of neutron scatter as a pos-
sible method of flaw detection in metals.

Even before the first ACSR line was strung, Alcoa supervisors
were on the job. The report above is dated June 14, 1906,
covering the erection of all-aiuminum conductors. Thus, the Alcoa
"Book-of-Knowledge" has grown rich with on-the-job experience.
That gondola of 954,000 circ. mil. Alcoa ACSR (Alumi-
num Cable Steel Reinforced) is only one of forty-
five similar carloads for one 230-kv transmission line.
The two million miles of Alcoa ACSR that carry
electricity across the country today are a
product of Imagineering. Back in the 90's, Alcoa
started with a fact: Aluminum is a good con-
ductor of electricity.
Imagineering involved building labs long
enough to mount whole spans of cable which
would be vibrated and mauled as the wind does.
It meant developing new basic data.
The lifetimes of many people and a good many
dollars invested in "Imagineering" Alcoa ACSR
speeded the more recent promotion of Alcoa
E.C. Aluminum for manufacturers of insulated
wire and cable. When the day comes that you
are specifying industrial wire and cable you'll
discover how Alcoa Imagineering brings savings
in both cost and weight when you "Figure it in
Aluminum." Aluminum Company of America,

ggj Experience, they say,
is the best teacher. But
you can avoid one pitfall if—
from the very start—your wir-
ing specifications call for
Sherarduct Rigid Steel Con-
duit. It has meant "perma-
nence" and "quality" to the
electrical trade for more than
40 years because it is proc-
essed to meet all the require-
ments of an outstanding
conduit.
• It is made of Spellerized steel
for a fine, even texture.
• It is Sherardized by alloying
zinc to steel to give it rust-
resistance and life-long pro-
tection. Zinc is applied so
smoothly that even the threads
are protected.
• It is treated with Shera-Solu-
tion enamel to give it smooth
surfaces and acid-resistance.
You can always expect a
feather in your cap when you
specify the installation of
Sherarduct. It will "last as
long as the building stands."
Sherarduct is but one of many
outstanding products made by
National Electric—a reliable
source of supply for any elec-
trical roughing-in materials
that you might need.

RADIOACTIVITY RESEARCH
(Continued from page 20)
The first step of the process is to inject
the radio-iodine into the living specimen
and, after an appropriate length of time
to allow the iodine to distribute itself, to
place a slice of the thyroid tissue under
a microscope.
Figure No. 2 is a microscopic photo-
graph of such a slice. The main require-
ment of the microscope is that it be of
such construction as to allow accurate ad-
justment of its focal length to within 1
micron (10~6 meters).
size of the silver makes possible the accur-
ate localization of the reactions. From this
point the process is one of precision
photography.
First a photo is taken of the top layer
(layer No. 3) at a comparatively small
magnification (Figure No. 2 is this type
of photo and it is taken at x 100 magnifi-
cation). This gives the general distribu-
tion of the iodine in the gland.
Next, a photo is taken of layer no. 1
at a much higher magnification (x 15).


Qe?/W-e/0~
'&amp; CO«r/»s
Pig. I—Thicknesses of layers I, 2 and 3 are greatly exaggerated relative to
the microscope.
The tissue slice (layer (1) in Figure
No. 1) containing the radio-iodine is
placed on the microscope slide and com-
pletely coated with a very thin application
of a specially prepared plastic substance
(layer no. 2) whose significant character-
istic is that it allows free movement of
radio-active particles.
A film of photo-sensitive emulsion
(layer no. 3) is placed over this plastic
coating. This emulsion is composed of
very fine grained silver bromide. The re-
alization of these super-small grains that
make the whole process possible is a per-
sonal achievement of Dr. Gomberg. The
plastic layer No. 2 is so thin that it allows
layers Nos. 1 and 3 to be intimately asso-
ciated and yet chemically separated.
The active particles in the tissue react
with the emulsion giving the black spots
evident in Figure No. 2. The tiny grain
(layer no. 3 is now out of focus). This
gives a picture of the cell structure of the
tissue. Now by varying the focal length
of the microscope but retaining the same
magnification a picture is taken of layer
no. 3, (layer no. 1 is now out of focus).
This gives a picture of the distribution of
the iodine by showing the black spots.
Now it may be seen that, by comparing
the last two photographs taken, the spots
can be identified with individual cells and
the functions of iodine in the cells of the
thyroid gland may be studied.
This is an example of but one use of
one method. Much better methods and
equipment must be and probably will be
invented. Realization of these methods
and equipment is the tremendous task
faced by science today.
It is hoped that the Phoenix Project
will be able to accept a large share of that
task.

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

Crankshafts stay rigid
• • • foods stay frigid
Designers of a compressor for refrigeration plants
were looking for a way to insure smooth, depend-
able crankshaft operation. They couldn't risk the
chance of breakdowns—and the food spoilage that
might result.
They stopped possible trouble at the design stage
—by mounting the crankshafts on Timken® tapered
roller bearings. Timken bearings take the heavy
radial, thrust and combination loads, prevent shaft
wobble, insure trouble-free service with minimum
maintenance.
Q: Short on space?
A: TIMKEN® bearings!
Because Timken bearings have a tapered design,
they carry loads from all directions. No separate
thrust devices needed. Also, Timken bearings have
line contact between rolls and races. This gives
them greater load capacity, permits use of smaller
bearings. The space-saving feature is another reason
why 9 out of 10 bearing applications can be handled
more efficiently by Timken bearings.

Cancer Research
In the medical field, atomic energy has
opened up hundreds of new and promis-
ing avenues of study. The one of widest
interest concerns the effects on cancer of
radiation from materials produced in
atomic energy facilities.
Radiation has a unique relation to can-
cer—it can cause cancer, diagnose cancer,
and kill cancer. In exploring this im-
portant connection between radiation and
cancer, scientists have concluded that the
cell is the meeting point. They are now
convinced that cancer is basically a cellu-
lar phenomenon. Radiation also has a
very local effect; it kills or cripples the in-
dividual cell. Thus a great body of re-
search is now devoted to investigation of
cells, of cell metabolism and cell growth.
Much of the work supported by AEC to
determine how radiation injures cells and
how, perhaps, injured cells can be re-
paired has application in cancer studies.
As part of its contribution to the battle
against cancer, the AEC is providing ra-
dioactive isotopes at nominal cost for
therapy and research. In the past three
(Continued from page 19)
years the use of these materials has spread
from a few major institutions to hospitals
and clinics throughout the country.
But some of the radioisotopes are short-
lived and will not be useful after ship-
ment. Also, the studies of cancer need
to take into account the effects of the
powerful radiation available from the
nuclear reactors. You can't ship reactors
around the country. Therefore, the AEC
is building small hospital facilities at Oak
Ridge, Brookhaven, and Argonne Na-
tional Laboratory where the reactors are.
There a few score of patients suffering
with certain types of cancer may be treat-
ed with these means and new knowledge
gained.
The AEC also supports five special
studies by universities on unique applica-
tions of radioisotopes to cancer diagnosis
and therapy.
It will be seen that the direct financing
of specific cancer research by AEC is but
a fraction of the noble effort in this field.
Our provision of radioisotopes is aiding
hundreds of men and institutions at work
on multifarious cancer problems. It is the

work of these men which will finally yield
the answers and bring more order into the
cancer puzzle, greater advance in staying
the ravages of cancer.
Data Exchange
One final comment about the import-
ance of the service that the informational
clearing house phase of the Proenix Proj-
ect may accomplish for atomic energy de-
velopment. The AEC can and does dis-
tribute the declassified and unclassified
results of its research. But this is not now
and never has been the sum of the work
being carried on. The greater the growth
in the volume of privately-financed basic
work, the more headway will we make in
development of atomic energy for pur-
poses of the national defense and the
general welfare. The lifeblood of present
growth in science is information about the
results of past research. Its circulation
throughout the body of science is impera-
tive.
There has been a past tendency to pull
back in the traces on exchange of atomic
energy information that is out in the open
free and clear of the mark of required
secrecy. This has risen, I suppose from
the wrong impression that the require-
ment of secrecy extended much more
widely than it actually did. Your project
for broadening and speeding distribution
of unclassified information should acceler-
ate the desirable trend toward more re-
search not financed by Government in the
natural and the social sciences bearing on
atomic energy.
I close, as I started, with the Atomic
Energy Commission's salute to the Phoe-
nix Project and our wish that it may
flourish.
Motor Cop (after a hard chase): "Why
didn't you stop when I shouted back
there?"

You're safe until the fire starts
When you go to sleep in a "fireproof
hotel, how safe are you? Consider this:
A hotel of "fireproof construction is very much like
a stove. The walls won't burn, but the contents will.
A small flame, kindling at the bottom, can be fanned
upward by hot drafts until it mushrooms into a holo-
caust. In all too many hotel fires, this has been the case.
No . . . "fireproof construction alone is not enough.
Authorities agree that the way to control fire, to hold
losses to a minimum, to protect lives, is an automatic
sprinkler system. Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler Sys-
tems check fire at its source, wherever and whenever
it strikes, night or day, with automatic certainty.
LOOK FOR THE GRINNUL SPRINKLER HtADS ON GUARD
Many hotels have provided this complete protec-
tion against fire. Look for the famous Grinnell sprinkler
heads in the hotel where you stop, in the hospitals and
institutions in your locality, the schools your children
attend, the plant where you work, in theatres, stores
and all public gathering places. They are your assur-
ance of positive, automatic fire protection.

(2) Study of electrolysis using radio-

(3) Study of effect on dielectric

other suitable dielectric media.
(4) Possible use of graded radioactive
sources to produce variable ionization in
low pressure cavities. It might be possible
to simulate ionosphere conditions in this
way.
(Continued from page
(5) Investigation of the behaviour of
thorium or other activators in activated
cathodes. This can probably best be done
by micro-auto-radiography.
(6) Development of direct viewing in-
struments for accurate location of radio-
active areas (we already have one such
project under way, with the aid of an
Atomic Energy Commission grant).
(7) Development of new rugged high
sensitivity particle detector systems.
(8) Investigation of new energy trans-
fer effects for particle detection.
Direct Recovery
One other important phase of atomic
power development has received consid-
eration. This is the fact that present
methods of energy recovery from atomic
piles are all based on heat generation,
yet the fission fragments, when formed,
possess high electric charges. Direct
energy recovery by electric field methods
from high energy charged particles is pos-
sible (being just the inverse of particle
acceleration). Thus it seems that a pre-
liminary study of direct electric energy re-
covery possibilities from fission processes
would be a worthwhile undertaking.
Additional Proposals
Still other proposals include (1) inves-
tigation of instruments and techniques for
measurement of the mechanical state of
materials using radioisotope methods;
(2) development of a powerful, high-
frequency vacuum tube to supply high
voltage to an accelerator for production
of very high energy electrons; and (3)
construction of an electronic digital com-
puter, or mechanical brain.
Thus it seems inevitable that engineer-
ing will play one of the most (if not the
most) important part in the realization
of the "Utopian era" mentioned at the
beginning of this article. By such means
as the cooperation of the College of Engi-
neering of the U. of M. with the Michi-
gan Memorial—Phoenix Project, it seems
highly probable that countless peacetime
uses of atomic energy will be developed
within our time.

The hardest material
made by man
is which
of these?
□ Silicon Carbide
□ Tungsten Carbide
□ Boron Carbide
□ Carbon Tool Steel
The answer is Boron Carbide (B4C), pro-
duced by Norton under the trade-mark
NORBIDE*. To make NORBIDE Boron
Carbide, two of the most commonplace
substances — carbon, in the form of
coke, and the familiar household
boric acid — are fused in electric furnaces
at approximately 5000°F, almost twice
the melting point of steel. The result is
the hardest material ever manufactured
commercially — harder, even, than any
natural precious stone except the
diamond!

In the Norton Research Laboratory, William C.
Arthur, B. S. in A. E., Cornell '48, studies a problem
in abrasive development.
Unique Properties
Despite its extreme hardness, NORBIDE
Boron Carbide is lighter than aluminum.
Its coefficient of expansion is only about

one-third that of steel, while in molded
form it has high compressive strength —
up to 300,000 lbs per sq in. Although
distinctly non-metallic, it is a fair con-
ductor of electricity, and it has extremely
high resistance to corrosion. Industrially,
one of its most important features is that
it is self-bonding. Under terrific temper-
ature and pressure this material may be
molded — without bonds or cementing
metals — into a homogeneous, dimen-
sionally accurate crystalline body that
may be polished to a hard, smooth sur-
face ideal for many commercial purposes.
Wide Range of Usefulness
The valuable characteristics of NORBIDE
Boron Carbide have provided engineering
departments with solutions to some of
industry's trickiest problems. In pow-
dered form it is used for many abrasive
jobs hitherto possible only with diamond
dust. In molded form it is unrivalled for
resistance to abrasion. NORBIDE gages
and sand-blasting nozzles, for example,
outlast their metal equivalents many
hundreds of times.

In his work on the development of silicon carbide
refractories, Herbert Ueltz, Ph. D., Rutgers '49, re-
moves refractory samples from a high temperature
laboratory furnace.
Norton . . . and You
NORBIDE Boron Carbide is but one of
many similar Norton achievements, devel-
oped throughout a long history of "mak-
ing better products to make other prod-
ucts better." Young engineers now plan-
ning their careers will do well to con-
sider the field of abrasives — and Norton.

University of Michigan Alumni Associa-

the Committee appointed by the Board
of Regents to study the advisability of
adopting a War Memorial Program and
recommends that such a Memorial in-
corporate the philosophy that it is better
to commemorate the memory of those who
have made the supreme sacrifice by at-
tempting to develop a project that will
aid all mankind in living in a war-free
world rather than to attempt to build a
mound of stone the purpose of which
might soon be forgotten.
When Fred Smith's plan was presented
to the committee, it was enthusiastically
received. The general reaction was, "This
is it! Why should we look further?"
Obstacles immediately, however, began to
appear, the seemingly insurmountable one
being Public Law 585—an act for the
development and control of atomic energy
—probably the most absolute legal docu-
ment ever drawn in the United States of
America. Since the Atomic Eenergy Com-
mission had absolute control of any ac-
tivity within the field of atomic energy,
(Continued from page 40)
the committee obviously needed to secure
the most authoritative advice and counsel.
It called into consultation, in addition to
Vice-President Niehuss of the Law School,
Dean Ralph A. Sawyer who had been the
civilian technical director of the Joint
Task Force One of the atomic bomb tests
at the Bikini Atoll in 1946; Dr. Fred J.
Hodges, Professor of Roentgenology in
the Medical School, who had experiment-
ed for some time with isotopes; and Dr.
H. R. Crane, Professor Physics, who had
played an important role in the atom
bomb's development.
Meeting with the AEC
Although in the course of discussions
the committee attempted again and again
to consider other meritorious projects as
functional memorials, inevitably the dis-
cussions always returned to Fred Smith's
suggestion, the students particularly being
unwilling to think seriously of an alter-
native until every possible means of effect-
ing his suggestion had been explored.
After a series of attempts to arrange a
meeting with representatives of the
Atomic Energy Commission in Washing-
ton, such a meeting was held March 24,
1948, with Dr. Shields Warren of the
Commission, and was attended by Dean
Sawyer, Dr. Hodges, and the author. As
a result of that meeting, the committee re-
ceived, under date of March 24, the fol-
lowing letter from Carroll L. Wilson,
General Manager of the Atomic Energy
Commission:
"The Atomic Energy Commission has
learned with interest of the proposal of

Why they put a glass pipe line underneath
Buttermilk Channel
If you've ever driven through a long tunnel,
you know how hard the lights are on your
eyes.
The reason is you pass under a succession
of bright spots of light which are apt to
take your attention from the road. And
you're made uncomfortable by the reflec-
tion of these bright spots from the top of
the car ahead.
But New York's new 9117-foot Brook-
lyn-Battery Tunnel—America's longest,
built and operated by the Triborough
Bridge and Tunnel Authority—has an
amazingly different and better kind of tun-
nel lighting.
Instead of the disturbing flicker of lights
placed at regular intervals, motorists enjoy
bright and even illumination—practically
daylight—every foot of the way beneath
Buttermilk Channel and New York Harbor.
The pipe line for this flood of light is built
of 3000 twelve-foot sections of Coming's
Pyrex brand glass tubing. Each length of
pipe is a self-contained light cartridge, with
two slim fluorescent lamps inside.
Should one of the lamps die out, that
cartridge is replaced with another, assem-
bled and kept ready on a repair truck. And
replacement is made as easily as you'd pop
a new bulb into a light fixture in your home.
The twelve-foot sections of Pyrex pipe
are only two inches in diameter, with walls
only a quarter of an inch thick. But despite
their slimness, they're so strong they can
withstand washing with a high-pressure
hose. They're so sturdy they're not injured
by truck tarpaulins which sometimes work
loose and slap against them.
Designers of this new tunnel lighting sys-
tem had no trouble findinga material needed
to make it work because, years ago, Corn ing
developed heat-resistant Pyrex pipe for in-
dustrial use.
Throughout industry, Corning means re-
search in glass—research that has helped
make glass a material of practically limit-
less uses.
So, when you're out of college and busy
planning new products or processes, or im-
provements in existing ones, it will pay you
to keep glass in mind. Then we hope you
will call on Corning before your planning
reaches the blueprint stage. Corning Glass
Works, Corning, New York.

PROBLEM You're designing a radio broadcast trans-
mitter. The circuit includes condensers and other variable
elements which must be adjusted by the operator. You want
to place these elements for optimum circuit efficiency and
where they will be easy to assembly, wire, and service. At
the same time, you want to centralize the control knobs at a
point convenient to the operator. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER
Use S.S.White remote control type flexible shafts to couple
the variable elements to their control knobs. This leaves you
free to place both the elements and the knobs anywhere you
want them. And you get control
that is as smooth and sensitive
as a direct connection because

power for its serious consideration by economic researchers.
It need not wait because methodological problems, by defi-
nition, can be engaged in without precise substantive data.
Two broad avenues of approach are open to researchers. The
one, which holds forth the least attractiveness, is to reexamine
systematically the historical literature of economics with an eye
to learning from historical efforts to cope with problems of
technological unemployment, business cycles, etc. what tech-
niques and conceptual frameworks might be useful in the atomic
power context. Although the probabilities are reasonably high
that few really valuable lessons will be learned, there is some
point in at least a limited effort in this direction. Such an
effort has in fact been sponsored by the Social Science Research
Council.
The other and more promising approach consists in mak-
ing, on the basis of the best technical data available, an as-
sumption as to the probable range of atomic power costs.
With this as a point of departure, the -esearchers will find
himself in precisely the same position( or predicament!) that
a researcher tackling the problem several years to a decade
hence when more abundant data from operating reactors is
available Although only limited substantive conclusions can
be hoped for from such an analytic process (unless by chance
eventual atomic power costs should happen to coincide with the
assumed points on the range presently employed,) i.tver-
the less much can be expected in the way of development and
improvement of specific techniques.

Science finds a way
to wipe out rust
Here at Standard Oil we are constantly
seeking ways to escape the costly conse-
quences of rust and other forms of corrosion.
One place where corrosion hits hard is our
cross-country pipeline system. Scientists
long ago discovered that some types of cor-
rosion are caused by electrical charges that
flow away from metal into the soil, carrying
with them small particles of metal.
Standard Oil engineers are employing a
practical method for protecting our pipelines.
It consists of burying deposits of scrap metal
or more active metals at intervals along the
pipeline and making connection. A weak
electrical charge is then used to reverse the
natural corrosive force, causing the metal
deposit to do the rusting instead of the pipe.
This method has been proved in use, but
it is not the final answer. Standard Oil re-
search men are seeking better solutions to
the problem of corrosion and of many other
problems as well.
For men who enjoy facing up to the chal-
lenge of the unknown, there is no better place
to work than Standard Oil. In the first place,
we deal with petroleum, the master fluid of
progress and probably the most versatile raw
material in the world. Secondly, we deal
every day with questions—corrosion, for
example—that are not necessarily inherent
to petroleum research.
That is why Standard Oil needs and uses
skills from practically every field of science
and technology. We provide our scientists
and technical men with the finest equipment
and try to create a favorable climate in
which their ideas may grow. They have re-
sponded with outstanding contributions of
real benefit to millions of their fellow-citizens.

mittee to further knowledge in this new
field and the intent to explore the bene-
ficial potentialities of atomic energy. From
the proposed center may come an answer
to some of the urgent biological problems
of today. Funds of the Atomic Energy
Commission for basic research, its fel-
lowship program and its training facili-
ties are planned to assist in development
of programs of this broad type."
At the suggestion of Fred Smith, the
war memorial was named the Phoenix
Project.
The Phoenix Project: We have named
the memorial the Phoenix Project because
the whole concept is one of giving birth
to a new enlightenment, a conversion of
ashes into life and beauty. The Phoenix
Project, as we visualize it, would consist
of an academy of scholars recruited from
this and other universities. It is our
thought that they would devote their full
creative powers to the task of converting
atomic energy to peace-time purposes and
of utilizing it for the benefit of mankind.
These men would carry on their researches
in a group of laboratories and work-rooms
which would be entered through a me-
(Continued from page 42)
morial rotunda or similar structure. This
structure would in itself be a constant re-
minder that the University had effectually
recognized the aims for which its students
and alumni gave their lives. A functional
memorial, it would explore the beneficent
aspects and implications of atomic energy
with the same determination and enthu-
siasm as the Manhattan Project explored
the destructive aspects.
On May 1, 1948, the committee pre-
sented the following resolution to the
Board of Regents, which gave its unanim-
ous approval:
The Second Resolution
Resolved: That the War Memorial
Committee recommend to the Board of
Regents that the University create as its
War Memorial a Center to explore the
ways and means by which the potentiali-
ties of atomic energy may become bene-
ficent influences in the life of man.
On May 17, a special edition of the
Daily announced the project to the student
body.
Art Der Derian, one of the student
members of the committee, at one of the
early meetings, made this comment: "I
don't know what form a war memorial
should take. I do feel, however, that it
ought to be a light, high in the sky, and
visible not only to our veterans who are
back at the University but to their sons
and all future generations of students.
They should always see it. It should al-
ways remind them of the ideals for which
our students gave their lives."
Although the Michigan Memorial-
Phoenix Project is not an actual light,
housed in a tower, it is a light of much
greater intensity. The source of its energy
has already been supplied by our students
and our alumni. That energy is constantly
being increased and will be recognized, as
Art Der Derian envisioned that it would
be, "not only by our veterans but by their
sons and all future generations of stu-
dents."

Research and teaching of chemical engineer-
ing relies on accurate knowledge of the ma-
terials being processed, not only of the quantity,
but also of the chemical composition and physi-
cal nature. The Department of Chemical and
Metallurgical Engineering makes available to
the student several precision instruments for
rapid and accurate analyses, thus freeing him
from tedious routine work and allowing empha-
sis upon broader engineering aspects.
A mass spectrograph and x-ray dif-
fraction equipment are among the
important instruments of this labor-
saving type. The mass spectrograph,
pictured above, separate compounds
and elements quantitatively accord-
ing to their molecular weights, even
those which are isotopes. X-ray dif-
fraction equipment, pictured at right,
records the intensity of x-radiation
reflected from a solid in such a way
that the crystalline nature of the solid
is determined. In addition to these
instruments an infra-red spectro-
graph, a flame photometer, and
many portable measuring devices,
electrical, physical, and chemical,
are available.

A BRAND NEW FIELD
RAY LADENDORF
Editor-in-Chief
Extent . . .
About 60,000 people are now engaged
in the new and potentially large field of
atomic-energy work. At present these
people are employed directly by the
Atomic Energy Commission and its con-
tractors. The expansion of this field ap-
pears to be almost limitless and the oppor-
tunities now available are quite similar
to those that existed in the infant radio
industry in 1920.
There are three major fields of effort in
the applications of atomic energy: the
production of raw materials, the utiliza-
tion of radioactive materials produced by
nuclear reactors in science and in indus-
try, and the production of useful power.
In each of these fields opportunities draw
the engineer. Between sixty and eighty
percent of all the technical positions open
will be filled by engineers; the remainder
mainly will be made up of physists
and chemists.
Production of Fuel . . .
The techniques used so far in the pro-
duction of raw materials have been mainly
adaptations of those common to the min-
ing and ore-refining industries. Although
much higher standards of purity are re-
quired, the refining of the uranium ore is
not very different from the other refining
and chemical industries up to the point of
use of the material in the reactors. Men
with conventional training in mining and
chemical engineering probably will be
able to handle the jobs.
Isotopes . . .
Radioactive isotopes for industrial,
scientific, medical, and agricultural uses
are at the present time the main peacetime
contribution of the development of atomic
energy. Medicine and biology at present
constitute the largest fields for the use of
isotopes; industrial and metallurgical
uses account for ten percent of the ship-
ments.
Most applications of radioisotopes re-
quire special instruments and tools for the
remote handling of radioactive materials.
The demand for these special instruments
has led to the building up of a sizeable
new radioactive instrument business, and
there are now more than thirty firms sup-
plying equipment of this sort. These firms
employ physicists, chemists, and engineers
who have specialized in instrumentation.
Power Plants . . .
Much work is being started toward de-
veloping atomic-energy power plants.
The Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,
operated by the General Electric Company,
primarily is working on the development
of stationary power plants. Westinghouse,
sponsored by the United States Navy, is
going forward in developing ship and
especially submarine power plants. The
Fairchild Aircraft and Engine Corpora-
tion, sponsored by the Air Force, is work-
ing on nuclear energy powerplants for
aircraft. In these specific projects many
engineers will be needed in electrical, me-
chanical, marine, and aeronautical engi-
neering; their work will be only indi-
rectly connected with nuclear energy.
Much work is being done to obtain the
maximum possible heat transfer from the
smallest possible volume, since nuclear
fuel is so expensive that it is profitable to
invest a considerable amount of mechani-
cal and metallurgical effort in getting the
maximum amount of heat out of a given
amount of this fuel. Mechanical engineers
specializing in heat transfer will be need-
ed for some time to come in this work.
Corrosion problems within the reactors
will require the services of many chem-
ists and metallurgists. The conventional
corrosion problems are complicated by the
difficulty of maintenance of the inner
parts of the reactors due to the intense
levels of radioactivity.
Civil engineers will also find their
work waiting for them in the field of
atomic-energy development. Civil engi-
neers will be needed to build the plants
and, more important, provide for the dis-
posal of radioactive wastes.
Prerequisites
Almost all the engineering in nuclear
energy projects is exactly the same kind
of engineering required elsewhere in in-
dustry. Atomic-energy development pro-
vides engineers with the same old prob-
lems but in a new setup and with a dif-
ferent background. Basically the same
engineering training is required. However,
most of the technical people to be used
in the atomic-power effort in the future
will need some training in the special
fields of current engineering, and in phys-
ical, chemical, and metallurgical skills.
Perhaps ten percent will need the new fis-
sion and neutron knowledge of modern
nuclear physics. Some of this they may be
able to get in college, but security re-
strictions and the difficulty of obtaining
expensive and restricted equipment and
materials will mean that much of the
specialized technical knowledge will have
to be obtained on the job.
A considerably larger group than the
above ten percent, consisting of chemical
engineers together with chemists and
health physicists, will need practical
knowledge of how to handle redioactive
materials in bulk. This knowledge also
will be obtained on the job.
For You???
Here, then, is a brand new field of
engineering, waiting to be developed. Op-
portunities for the expansion and the de-
velopment of new uses for atomic energy
are great. Atomic-energy development
needs men—witness the ads in recent
journals. Is this the field for you?

Tiiis Is a picture of * P/M&lt;3
//
It's a picture that gives automotive engi-
neers clear-cut facts on performance—a
picture that suggests how photography with
its ability to record, its accuracy and its
speed, can play important roles in all
modern business and industry.
No, this is not the "doodling" of a man on the tele-
phone. Far from it. It's the photographic record of
an oscilloscope trace that shows, and times, detona-
tion in a "knocking" engine. It all happens in a few
hundred-thousandths of a second—yet photography
gets it clearly and accurately as nothing else can.
Oscillograph recording is but one of countless
functional uses of photography in bettering prod-
ucts and improving manufacturing methods. High
speed "stills" can freeze fast action at just the crucial
moment—and the design or operation of a part can
be adjusted to best advantage.
And high speed movies can expand a second of
action into several minutes so that fast motion can
be slowed down for observation—and products be
made more dependable, more durable.
Such uses of photography—and many more—can
help you improve your product, your tools, your
production methods. For every day, functional pho-
tography is proving a valuable and important ad-
junct in more and more modern enterprises.

reasons why college graduates
at G.E. find work that they like
"In seeking to place college graduates in
jobs they will enjoy doing," M. M. Boring,
manager of the Technical Personnel Divi-
sions, said recently, "we at General Electric
find our work made easy by the diversifica-
tion of the company's business.
"We tell a newcomer to look around, to
work in several different fields, to try to de-
termine where he will be most satisfied. The
company's eight Operating Departments,
ranging from Chemical to Apparatus, from
the making of lamps to the building of big
turbines and electric locomotives, give him
plenty of room for his search.
"Engineers, chemists, physicists, and math-
ematicians, as well as liberal arts graduates,
all find work here that they can be interested
in and can do with enthusiasm.
"Their ability to find satisfying jobs with
us is, we feel, an important factor in keeping
General Electric ahead in electrical research,
engineering, and manufacturing."

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

Rigid rule (or spindles
Machine tool engineers have to design for maxi-
mum spindle rigidity to insure extreme, long-lasting
precision. That's why most of them make it a rule to
mount the spindle on Timken* tapered roller bear-
ings. Timken bearings keep the shaft in positive
alignment, minimize friction and maintain original
precision — normally for the life of the machine.
How TIMKEN® bearings hold
shafts in alignment
Because a Timken bearing has tapered construc-
tion, it carries radial loads, thrust loads and combi-
nations of both. End-play and deflection in the shaft
are practically eliminated. Line contact between the
rollers and races of a Timken bearing provides
a wider, more rigid support for the shaft. These
features are two of the reasons why machine tool
bearing applications can be handled more efficiently
with Timken bearings.

Some journals are technical publications.
Some journals are the parts of rotating shafts
that turn in bearings.
For both kinds of journals, there's good news
in Standard Oil's performance testing program.
One result is a new testing device for mill and
locomotive driving-journal grease that enables
us to tell more accurately than ever before what
our greases will do under actual conditions of
use. That, in turn, enables us to proceed more
directly with the job of making our greases
still better.
Standard Oil took the lead in performance
testing, and is a leader today. During the war
our tests furnished information that enabled
the Army to procure certain products with
greatly increased reliability of performance.
Some of our tests have become a part of govern-
ment specifications. Many users of our prod-
ucts are benefiting, both from better products
and from more accurate information.
As time goes on, we are doing more and more
performance testing. In some cases, we have to
develop not only the tests but also the testing
equipment. But to Standard Oil researchers
and engineers, any effort is worth while if it
will help make better, more useful petroleum
products.

GEORGE D. PFAFFMAN '51EE
Ford goes automatic. Some ten years
ago, the first automobiles came out with
a new idea of automatic shifting. Ever
since that time the average American has
become used to the idea and is now be-
ginning to accept it wholeheartedly. In
fact it is fast becoming standard equip-
ment. Last month Ford Motor Com-
pany introduced the '51 Ford car with
"Fordomatic Drive." The '51 Ford is,
however, not the first Ford car to be
equipped with an automatic transmission.
Some months back, the '51 Mercury was
introduced with an automatic drive
known as the "Merc-O-matic Drive." In
the interest of clarification the automatic
transmission involved in both the Fordo-
matic and Merc-O-matic Drives are the
same transmission. This transmission was
developed by Ford Motor Company with
the cooperation of Borg Warner Corpora-
tion.
The Ford automatic transmission is
composed of a dynamic fluid torque con-
verter coupled with a three speed gear box
of the planetary type. In order to analyze
the engineering aspects, let us see why
this combination of elements were used.
To quote Mr. Harold T. Youngren, Vice-

maximum tractive effort when necessary
and desired—to as slow an operating en-

bines certain operational advantages in-

to multiply tractive effort from stall to a

President, Engineering, Ford Motor Com-
pany, he summarized it in the following
four points:
"1. The transmission must go as far as
necessary to provide an over-all spread of
ratios sufficient to cover all conditions of
of such a nature as to function with a
minimum of slip when operating as a
fluid coupling.
3. The inherent torque converter char-
acteristics should be retained in the circuit
in top gear to gain the added flexibility of
performance that this device gives smooth-
ly and automatically.
4. The automatic power circuit must be
capable of giving satisfactory acceleration
with the equivalent of second gear start
of a four-speed transmission, in order to
eliminate the jack-rabbit start and effect of
unnecessary amount of tractive effort for
all automatic starts."
Points 1 and 4 are concerned mainly
with the characteristics of operation of the
gear box. The engineers at Ford Motor
felt that in order to obtain these charac-
teristics that a 3 speed gear box should
be used. The resultant design was: two
speeds being geared and one direct drive.
Points 2 and 3 stated by Mr. Youngren
concern the fluid torque converter. As a
result the final design had the following
characteistics and features according to
Mr. H. G. English:
1. Torque ratio slightly higher than 2.1
at stall.
2. An engine speed that rises with
vehicle speed. The characteristic of the
converter permits a reasonable stall speed
and a sufficient range of torque conver-
sion up to approximately 48 m.p.h.
3. A high converter efficiency above .5
speed ratio. This requirement is in order
to obtain good fuel mileage at those speed
ratios of converter which is the speed
range for much city driving.
4. A high coupling point, in the inter-
est of good performance, and low slip
when operating as a fluid coupling. This
is necessary since the drive is at all times
through the converter.
5. Also the converter design provides
integral air cooling.
These two elements, the 3 speed gear
box and the torque converter were com-
bined to form the Ford-Mercury automatic
transmission. The resultant characteris-
tics of the unit as shown in Table 1.
In order to evaluate more conclusively
the engineering design and the perform-
ance of the Ford-Mercury transmission,
let us consider two things: One why the
lock up principle was not used in Ford-
Mercury automatic transmission and sec-
ond, graphs illustrating the performance.
Two automatic transmissions on the mar-
ket today incorporate the lock up device.

New Engine Testing Dynamometer
G-E is now using a dynamometer of
new design for the testing of internal
combustion engines with great precision.
In addition to the dynamometer with
scales and accessories (as shown), several
other main components include a motar-
generator set with AC and DC controls
for delivering or absorbing power, ampli-
dynes for excitation to the dynamometer
and DC generator fields, and the opera-
tor's control console for the engine and
dynamometer.
Adjustable generator armature-voltage
and dynamometer field control is used.
Rheostats, coupled together and operated
in eequence, provide a smooth speed con-
trol from zero to the maximum rated
speed of the dynamometer by the turn of
a single rheostat arm. The separate am-
plidynes provide current limit, voltage and
speed limit. An electronic pre-amplifier,
operating from a speed-voltage signal,
provides close speed regulation when
needed.
The machine is ball-bearing cradled,
and is rated: 200 h.p. (adsorption), 150
h.p. (motoring), 2500/8000 rpm at 250
volts. It is shown testing a Ford V-8
engine.
New T. V. Tube
A tiny electronic tube, similar in princi-
ple to those used in radar and in quick-
cooling electronic ovens, has been de-
veloped by G. E. engineers for use in
ultra-high-frequency television receivers
Ultra-hig.h-frequency (UHF) channels,
when released for use by the Federal
Communications Commission, will require
such a tube to convert the UHF signal to
a usable frequency
The tube designed by G. E. engineers
to do this "beats" down the UHF signal
by sending out its own signal which,
when mixed with the UHF signal, pro-
duces a resulting lower frequency.
The new application marks the first con-
sumer use for the "magnetron" type of
tube, a joint development of the com-
pany's Research Laboratory and Elec-
tronics Department.
The new tube will operate in the pres-
ent "standard band" between 60 and 216
megacycles as well as in the UHF chan-
nels which may be assigned as high as 900
megacycles, according to the G.-E engi-
neers. The tube will be usable for color
television in addition to black and white.
Mass production of the miniature
"magnetron" tube will be timed with the
F. C. C.'s release of the new UHF chan-
nels.
Development in Die Steel
"Prestem," a newly developed hot

marking die steel is now being marketed
by the Heppenstall Company of Pitts-
burgh, in the form of solid press dies, in-
sert dies, upsetter dies, and punches.
According to the manufacturers, "Pres-
tem" will be particularly useful as a solid
die or insert die for those drop forge
plants who are making press and upsetter
forgings for the automotive, aviation, and
farm implement industries.
The new hot working die steel pos-
sesses the physical characteristics of de-
veloping a minimum amount of heat
checking—which is the cause of fatigue
failure—, and yet still resists the plastic
flow of hot metal during press forging
operations. These attributes are said to be
based on a precipitation hardening phen-
omena where "Prestem" undergoes a tem-
perature rise and develops an increase of
surface hardness. Other notable character-
istics of "Prestem" include a ready ma-
chinability at comparatively high hardness,
a high impact resistance, and an ability to
be water cooled during press forging op-
erations.
',Prestem" is being manufactured in
three hardness ranges, and is also distrib-
uted in a pre-hardened, untempered con-
dition.
Interference Gone At Last
Man-made interference or noise heard
on radio or television sets when an elec-
tric shaver or vacuum cleaner is plugged
in may someday be eliminated as a result
of research now being conducted at the
Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories,
Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.
Army engineers are staging a multi-
pronged attack on this noise by develop-
ing suppression methods, capable of
muzzling the interference. Unsuppressed
noise cuts down both the range and qual-
ity of the Army's various communications
systems.
Latest advance in this 10-year-old
war is the perfection of a new type "noise
meter" which can accurately measure the
unintentional interference as radiations
produced by electric fans, oil burners,
auto ignition systems, refrigerators, and
dozens of other household and industrial
products. The new meter not only tells
the Army whether the items will interfere
with its communications, but also gives,
for the first time, a true picture of the
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


its peak value and repetition rate.
Earlier models of the meter covered
frequencies used primarily for amplitute-
modulated radio signals. The new meter
has as greatly extended frequency range
and can be used not only for amplitute-
modulated signals but for frequency mod-
ulated radio signals, radar, television,
facsimile, and radio-teletype, all used by
the Army as well.
Many of the findings are being adapted
by industry in building equipment which
will not interfere with signal transmission.
Revolutionary Hydraulic Jack
For use where confined spaces limit
operation of a conventional lifting jack,
Duff Norton Company has developed the
"ho-hite" jack. An independent pump
connected to the jack by a length of hose
permits jack operation from the ground
or any convenient place.
With its closed height of only 4y2
inches, this jack will lift a 30 ton load 2
feet. For versatility in jacking operations
it is furnished with interchangeable point-
ed and radius tops, which are heat treated
to give long service life.
Hydraulic oil in the "ho-hite" jack is
contained in a separate chamber, inde-
pendent from the jacking unit. This fea-
ture permits operation of the jack in hori-
zontal, vertical, inverted, or inclined po-
sitions. When not in use, the jack folds
into a compact, easy-to-carry unit.
Because this jack operates efficiently
wherever space limitations exist, it has
many applications in the construction,
Marine, and general industrial field.
Successor to the SR-4 strain Gage
Three ranges are maximum at 2,000,
5,000 and 10,000 micro-inches per inch
in this new strip-chart electronic recorder
for use with the companion SR-4 resis-
tance wire strain gage manufactured by
the Baldwin Locomotive Works. The re-
corder makes a continuous trace of sur-
face strain in a machine or structure. The
insrtument includes adjustment for gage
factor, range, coarse and fine zero settings
to assist in correct application.
Resistance variations in the strain gage
are measured by a 1000 cps bridge cir-
cuit. Ten chart speeds range from % to
720 inches per hour. The chart is 4y2
inches in width in the pen recorder area.
The pen moves at right angles to the chart
movement to simplify readings of time vs.
strain. Full scale transverse speeds are 1,
3, and 5 seconds. The pen can be zeroed
at any point on the chart and the instru-
ment range can be changed at any time
during a measuring if zero adjustment set-
tings have been determined initially for
all three ranges.
"Internal Vision" Plastic
A new plastic that can be made into
scale models of machine parts and tools
now is providing "internal vision" for
engineers in military, university, and
industrial laboratories, according to the
Westinghouse scientists who developed it.
The new "photoplastic" is aiding re-
searchers in gun factories, airplane engine
plants, arsenals, naval laboratories, and
universities in the design of stronger
machinery and equipment. The 3-dimen-
sional scale models cut from the plastic
enable engineers to get a "portrait in
color" of the strain encountered in tools,
machine parts, and other objects.
One of the major applications of the
new material is in the design of breech
blocks for big guns. To understand the
terrific stresses these parts undergo during
firing of the gun, an exact scale model of
the block has been built and "loaded" to
simulate the stress. When "frozen into
the material and then viewed through
special polarized light, the stress pattern
appears as a series of varicolored lines that
tell the engineer where the major stresses
are located, in which direction they are
acting, and just how great they are.
Even medical scientists may find the
new material of great value because ex-
perimental leg-bone models have shown
that internal stresses in human bone struc-
ture, such as those caused by fractures or
heavy blows can be clearly viewed and
analyzed.
The new plastic is a form of Fosterite,
a waterproof material developed by West-
inghouse during World War II to seal
radio and radar parts against moisture.
Automotive Bearing Design
Designers of automotive engine bear-
ings must, in effect, strike a balance be-
tween strength and softness, a General
Motors Research engineer reported re-
cently to the American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers.
Arvid E. Roach of GM Research Lab-
oratories explained that "softness," which
engineers define as embedability, permits
microscopic abrasive particles to be ab-
sorbed by bearing surfaces without caus-
ing damage to the shaft or failure of the
bearing. Embedability is the ability of a
bearing surface to tolerate abrasives.
At the same time, he said, improving
embedability of a bearing surface tends to
reduce a bearing's fatigue strength or dur-
ability.
The fact that motorists rarely experience
bearing failures nowadays, Mr. Roach de-
clared, "is a tribute to the care ... by
manufacturers in insuring that microscopic
dirt, chips, grinding particles, core sand,
etc., are thoroughly cleaned from an en-
gine before it is placed in the customer's
hands."
Importance of a clean engine, he ex-
plained, is indicated by the fact that bear-
ing and journal surfaces of an automotive
crankshaft may be separated by an oil film
only one ten thousandth (.0001) of an
inch thick.
Whenever bearings are subjected to so-
called dynamic or intermittant loading, as
they are in auto engines with each piston
thrust, fatigue strength is preferred over
embedability, Mr. Roach pointed out.
"Embedability, on the other hand," he
added, "is not an indispensable property
—if we could prevent abrasive particles
from reaching the bearings, we would not
need to be concerned over it at all."
Mr. Roach's report was based on labora-
tory tests in which bearings were deliber-
ately sabotaged with abrasive-laden oils.
The test disclosed, he said, that abrasive
particles smaller than the minimum oil
film thickness between journal and bear-
ing—one ten thousandth of an inch—
have no serious effect on bearing per-
formance.
Above that limit, he declared, "dirt in
the form of abrasive particles suspended
in the oil constitutes a serious threat to
satisfactory bearing operation."
Because no insurance against all types
of abrasive particles in an engine is avail-
able, bearings must be designed with suffi-

BY
MARLENE A. SCHULHAUSER '52CE
"What on earth made you decide to
take engineering?"
I have been asked that question over
and over again since I first registered at
the University of Michigan for my fresh-
man year, and it is pretty hard to answer.
I still do not really know why I made
up my mind to enroll in the engineering
school. My father is a civil engineer, but
I have no star-studded visions of follow-
ing in his footsteps. I want a job as an
engineer, but my ambition is not to climb
to the top of the ladder. The fact that
my father is in the engineering field prob-
ably had something to do with my decid-
ing to take the course though, because I
have noticed that most of the girls who
are in the engineering school are daugh-
ters of engineers. Perhaps the explana-
tion of this fact is that they are in most
cases more acquainted with the field of
engineering than girls whose fathers are
not engineers; therefore, if they are at
all inclined toward engineering, their in-
terest in that field has a chance to de-
velop. That interest has to be fairly keen
if a girl is going to make the grade and
earn a B.S. in engineering.
Being a student in "engine school" is
not an easy task for a boy; believe me, it
is a much harder one for a girl. That is
why a girl must like engineering very
much if she hopes to stick with it. The
courses she has to take are difficult, but
not impossible. From the very start of her
college career she must expect to spend
long hours studying math, physics, chem-
istry, engineering mechanics, and many
other technical courses. She has to get
used to the idea of being the only girl in
most of her classes. I do not mean that
sarcastically. Many girls would jump at
the chance of being in a class full of boys,
or say they would anyway. Even though
it is not exactly a horrible fate, it is awk-
ward in the beginning and a little hard to
get used to. Then too, a girl does not
have upper-classmen in the dorm who can
help her with her courses like the boys
do. The girl engineer also has many labs
to attend. She must weld, heat treat, and
run tensile tests on metals as well as per-
forming many other "unladylike" jobs
It is hard to remember you are a girl at
a time like that. I guess the instructors
even forget, because many of them call a

MARLENE A. SCHULHAUSER
girl "fellow' without batting an eyelash.
These situations can be very amusing.
The instructors' reactions to girls in
their classes are quite varied. Some teach-
ers think that the idea of a girl taking
engineering is perfectly ridiculous, others
are indifferent, while still others really
try to help the girls and give them a little
encouragement.
Being a girl engineer is indeed a very
different experience and also a very inter-
esting one. Besides continually meeting
people who are amazed at the fact that
she is actually undertaking a course like
engineering, the female "slipstick-pusher"
frequently experiences amusing and some-
times embarrassing incidents in classes
and at extra-curricular engineering activi-
ties. Instructors who have only men in
their classes often get in the habit of
using rather profane language at times
and of course think nothing of it; but,
when there is a lady (or ladies) present
and they say a few words which they
should not have said, they usually apolo-
gize to the girl (or girls). This always
causes a few chuckles. Some men do not
have an apologetic attitude however. At
one meeting which I attended I was the
only girl present. During the course of
the talk the speaker had used several pro-
fane words. He finally looked at me and
said, "I notice that there is a young lady
present; you will have to excuse me but I
am talking to MEN and I want to talk
THEIR language." I was quite peeved
at the time and thought he had a lot of
nerve but of course I did not say anything.
One time during my freshman year my in-
structor asked me if I would please leave
the room, implying that my presence pre-
vented him from using the language he
wished. When this particular incident oc-
curred the teacher was just joking.
A girl gets used to this after a while
and pays little or no atention to remarks
like that. She has to; she would go crazy
if she took them all seriously. As a first
semester freshman she feels extremely
awkward in class and wonders how she
should act. Should she try to make friends
with the fellows in her classes or will
they think she is flirting, or should she
be aloof and act very businesslike or will
they consider her a snob? This may sound
silly to the reader but they actually are
the thoughts which run through her
mind, not only "run" through but stay
there for a while. However, after she is
in engineering school for a semester or
so she loses most of her self-consciousness
and does not even think about those
things anymore.
One of the most difficult things a girl
in engineering has to do is to forget that
she is a girl while she is in classes, espe-
cially labs. But, while this is hard for her
at first, it is possible for her to get in a
rut, and really act like "one of the boys"
and acquire masculine traits. After a girl
has been in engineering school for a
couple of years and has gotten used to
working along side of fellows, this is
more than just a possibility. The female
engineer not only has to guard against this
tendency, but she has to go a step further
and prove to everyone, especially the male
engineers, that she is just as feminine as
any girl in Lit school, for example. Too
many people have the idea that girls who
are enrolled in engineering school are the
grown-up version of tomboys. This im-
pression is entirely wrong. Everyone in
this world has different likes and dislikes,
and the fact that some girls happen to be
interested in the field of engineering is
no reason to brand them unladylike.
Even though I am one of the few girls
taking engineering, I do not believe in
an-all out crusade to increase the enroll-
ment of women in the engineering

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


MILITARY SERVICE

DEAN IVAN C. CRAWFORD
College of Engineering
University of Michigan
Under authorization of National Headquarters, the Local
Selective Service Boards have been postponing the induction of
college students until the end of the academic year. So long
as the student is enrolled in the University and has a passing
grade, the postponement seems to be automatic. Originally,
there was a condition that the student should be in the upper
half of the c.ass. The lack of such a scholastic position has
not, to date, operated to his disadvantage. The entrance of
Red China into the Korean situation will speed up the induc-
tion rate and probably force a tougher policy, so far as defer-
ments are concerned, after June, 1951.
Universal Military Service as proposed by President Conant
of Harvard would take practically every youth and place him in
the armed services, or in war work within the capabilities of
the individual if he is not physically fit for combat service.
In either case the pay would be the same. The stint would
be two years, and the student would enter on his "hitch" upon
graduation from high school, or at 18 years of age. There
would be no deferments. The plan has much to recommend it.
Probably it would not be adopted as a whole, but parts may
well be used in amending the present draft law.
Advisory Committees to Selective Service have recom-
mended a plan for student deferment. High School graduates
with satisfactory records and able to secure scores of 120 or
better on the Army General Classification Test would be de-
ferred from military service to enter college. From there on,
a fraction of the class with the highest scholastic record would
remain in college while those lower down, even though pass-
ing, would lose the deferred status. Students consistently
standing high in their classes might, under this arrangement,
be deferred for a period of seven years—from high school
through the graduate school. The plan has been criticized
because such persons might pass through emergency with no
personal sacrifice whatever.
Present indications point to some revisions of the Selective
Service law which will probably include a stiffer policy on the
subject of deferments. Selective Service officials and college
administrators will have their say. The issues will be rescolved
by Congressional committees and by Congress, itself, where
there will be, we must assume, an objective, over-all view
which will take the entire manpower problem into account.
Engineering Education
Always a popular subject in national engineering publica-
tions, engineering education frequently receives thoughtful
and understanding treatment from the student publications of
the engineering colleges. Other writers occasionaly attempt
to shed light on the subject without familiarizing themselves
with the fundamental facts surrounding the subject.
Of very real value to all is the recent Report of the Com-
mittee on Educational Survey to the Faculty of the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology. It is a valuable addition to the
literature of engineering education and is the result of three
years' study of the several aspects of education at that institu-
tion
The following excerpts are of special interest:
It has been suggested that M. I. T. can best meet
modern educational needs by concentrating on special-
ized professional education in the graduate school, in
which it has been conspicuously successful, leaving the
undergraduate preparation to other schools. It has also
been suggested that if the undergraduate program is re-
tained it should be lengthened to five or six years, in
order to make room for the broader cultural background
and for the increased amount or specialized instruction
now necessary for undergraduate education in science and
technology.
We have considered and rejected both of these pro-
posals. We conclude that M. I. T. should continue to
offer a strong undergraduate program, and that for most
courses it should be limited to four years.
To lead the way to an improved synthesis of general
and professional education in a four-year undergraduate
program based on science and technology is the most im-
portant service M. I. T. can render to society. We believe
that M. I. T., because of its many years of experience
with the integral plan, is well qualified to undertake the
development of such an educational program.
The integral plan referred to is built on the theory that
"in science and technology it is possible to combine a sound
general education and a sound foundation for a professional
career in one undergraduate program."
The Report recommends that the humanities portion of the
program be increased to the extent that it will comprise a
minimum of 20 percent of the four-year program. This con-
forms to a recommendation of the American Society for Engi-
neering Education made immediately after World War II.
M. I. T. now requires students to enroll in a limited number
of carefully-coordinated courses of this nature.

cient embedability to enable them to tol-
erate the largest size particle they may be
subjected to, he explained.
"Probably the most effective means of
doing this is to provide a facing of soft
metal on the bearing surface. But here
we are confronted by the fatigue problem,
since the fatigue strength of such a facing
decreases with increasing thickness.
"We would, therefore, like to keep the
facing as thin as possible—that is, as thin
as manufacturing techniques will allow.
In any event, the experiments indicate that
for dirt absorption there is little benefit
to be gained by making the facing much
thicker than the maximum size of abrasive
particle minus the oil-film thickness," he
said.
"Since the oil-film thickness in engine
bearings is extremely small, maximum par-
ticle size may be taken as the criterion for
maximum overlay thickness," Mr. Roach
declared.
Detroit's Fluorescent Street Lights
The nation's first fluorescent street-
lighting system was placed in operation by
the Detroit Public Lighting Commission
in Detroit recently.
Instead of the conventional globes, the
new "white way" uses giant, eight-foot-
long, tubular fixtures, developed by engi-
neers of the General Electric Company.
The fixtures are aluminum tubes in
which two pairs of equally-long fluores-
cent lamps are mounted, engineers ex-
plained. Two scientifically-designed re-
flectors, mounted back to back in each
tube, direct light from these lamps
through clear plastic windows to the
street.
The system is installed along a half-
mile segment of Wyoming Avenue, a
principal north-south traffic artery. A
total of 24 fixtures extend out from over
the curb on either side of the street.
Louis J. S. Schrenk, superintendent of
the Lighting Commission, called the new
lighting system "spectacular and the most
outstanding street-lighting installation in
the United States."
He described the G. E.-developed fix-
tures as providing "a bright, virtually
glareless light, thereby contributing to
easy and quick seeing, and adding to the
comfort of motorists and pedestrians alike,
thus resulting in increased safety."
Collectively, the four fluorescent lamps
in each fixture produce approximately
19,000 lumens of light and provide on
average lighting level on the street of
about one footcandle. This is adequate
for heavy pedestrian and vehicular traffic,
according to Mr. Schrenk, because of the
fluorescent lighting's uniformity of illum-
ination.
The fixtures are mounted 25 feet high
on wood poles spaced at intervals ranging
from 100 feet to 140 feet.

New Splashproof Motor
Splashing liquids can play havoc with
electric motors. As a result, special motors
are required for such industries as food
processing, and for chemical plants and
refineries; these are protected from splash-
ing by a partially enclosed, solid rolled-
steel frame construction, and baffles to di-
vert water where ventilation openings are
necessary in the enclosure.
The Westinghouse Life-Line splash-
proof motor has recently been designed
for a wider range of ratings, to permit
more flexibility in the use of this type of
motor. They are now made in horsepower
ratings from 7]/2 to 100; in voltage
ratings of 208, 220, 440, 550, and 2300;
also for frequencies of 60, 50 and 25
cycles. All have prelubricated bearings.
Heating Magic
The Hannau Engineering Company of
New York has devised an ingenious new
assembly of the standard bunsen burner.
It operates on a pilot light and has a
convenient hand rest which supports the
side of the palm and leaves the fingers
free to move. In addition the hand rest
serves as a "touch" control to turn the
main burner on and off. The rest can be
turned to lock the burner open if desired.
Normally, only the pilot light remains
burning. The burner uses any fuel gas,
connects to a y4 inch rubber tube. A cup
for wax can be added.
Air Workhorse
The new Douglas C-124A globemaster

ing capacity by successfully taking off at a
gross weight of 194,500 pounds. At the
increased gross weight, the globemaster
can carry a pay load of approximately
50,000 pounds a distance of more than
2500 statute miles with adequate fuel re-
serves. When flying lesser ranges, the
maximum pay load may be increased to
over 70,000 pounds.
Original specifications for this Douglas
transport called for a gross take-off weight
of 175,000 pounds. In addition, the esti-
mated range for a pay load of 50,000
pounds is only 1500 statute miles.
Designed to carry troops, general cargo
and such heavy ground and Air Force
equipment as tanks, field guns, bulldozers,
and fully loaded trucks, the C-124A has
huge clamshell doors which provide an
opening 11 feet 8 inches high and 11 feet
4 inches wide. A built-in ramp permits
wheeled vehicles to drive or be rolled
through the nose doors into the cavernous
fuselage which contains more than 10,000
cubic feet of usable cargo space.
The single-deck, unobstructed cabin is
12 feet 10 inches high, 13 feet wide and
77 feet long. Loading and unloading is
additionally facilitated by an electrically
operated elevator which can be lowered to
the ground from the center of the cargo
section.
Because of its long range, high weight-
carrying capacity, and the facility with
which bulky material may be loaded and
deposited, the C-124A may be used for
large-scale air movement of graund
troops.
It is estimated that a fleet of 80 globe-
masters could transport an entire division
of 16,000 armed men from Westover Air
Base, Mass., to the vicinity of Brest,
France, with two refueling stops en route.
Another 80 C-124A's could have 2500
tons of divisional equipment over the
same route.
As a personnel carrier, the globemaster
has troop seat accommodations for 200
equipped. The fuselage construction in-
corporates two paratroop doors.
For air evacuation of casualties, it will
accommodate 127 litter cases, plus 25
attendants and ambulatory cases.

BY
TITUS G. LeCLAIR
President, National American Institute of Electrical Engineers
(Reprinted by permission from Electrical Engineering)
When I was graduated from high
school at the ripe old age of seventeen,
I was an educated man. On the practical
side, I could repair an electric iron so it
would work perfectly, and I could even
climb an electric line pole and connect
a wire without getting killed. On the
literary side, I had written and delivered
a valedictory address at my high school
graduation exercises, more than half of
which was in poetry. From then on, it
was only necessary to collect the fruits of
this education.
My father was quite an old fogy; all
he'd ever done in life was to learn all
about the timber business, which is back-
woodsy sort of stuff, and to own and
operate a sawmill. Just how he got along
with his men, how he made his mill work,
or where he got the customers for it were
minor details in which I had not the
slightest interest.
It was a fortunate accident that shortly
thereafter a motorcycle I was riding en-
countered a horse and buggy, and landed
me on my back with a broken leg In
those ensuing weeks, when the doctor said
that I could not climb poles for some
time, it occurred to me that I might just
as well go to college before making that
first J 10,000.
At the end of those four years, it was
astounding to me how much my father
had learned. Instead of an old foggy, he
seemed to be a man with some maturity
and judgment. He was shocked not only
that I listened to his advice, but even once
or twice asked for it, particularly on the
question of where I should go to get a
job.
It was about that time that I began to
wonder seriously when a man becomes
educated, and I have been wondering ever
since. Perhaps it will do no harm to ask
some of you here today the answer to
that question.
The ordinary college course leading to
a Bachelor's Degree is approximately four
years, and educators have a rather difficult
task within that time to pour into a stu-
dent what might be considered an educa-
tion. It is a hard enough job in the arts
colleges where the full four years are de-

of our present college educational system
for engineers and suggests ways in which
our education can be continued after formal
training is over.
voted to teaching you to live a broader
life and have an understanding of the arts
and sciences which make life more pleas-
ant and the world a nicer place to live in.
In an engineering college, the task is even
more difficult. If an engineer is to be-
come a reasonably well-rounded man and
not merely a highly specialized technician,
he must have a knowledge of the arts and
sciences, he must be able to express him-
self, and he must learn to think in
general. In addition to that, the engineer
must have enough education in his spec-
ialty in order to qualify to enter the pro-
fession.
In an engineering school, it is possible
to absorb only a fraction of the liberal
studies that are given to a student in a
college of arts in such matters as history,
foreign languages, and other general sub-
jects. It is even difficult to cover the var-
ious specialties in engineering. Your
deans, professors, and instructors hear a
continual plea from the graduates that a
student should be given more courses in
modern material such as electronics, ultra-
sonics, atomic energy, nuclear fission, and
other new material which was unknown
10 to 20 years ago. Other volunteer ad-
visors make the opposite plea that a stu-
dent should have more of the funda-
mentals such as mathematics, chemistry,
physics, and so on. How can our colleges
strike a balance between these two po-
sitions?
A compromise has been made in that
the college course over the first two
years, including basic arts and sciences
and the fundamentals of engineering, is
essentially the same for all branches of
the profession. In the third year, the
courses begin to spread out, but the me-
chanical engineers and the electrical engi-
neers take courses that are very nearly
alike. Even in the fourth year, there are
many courses that are common to all
branches of the profession. In other
words, there is very little time to get more
than a mere smattering of the specialties
that are implied in the 90 different
branches of the engineering profession
which are important enough to form the
basis of some professional engineering so-
ciety.
Does this mean that at the end of
four years of college, an engineer is not
quite educated, not quite competent in the
specialized profession that he is to enter?
I think, perhaps, it does. This statement
in no way belittles those persons respon-
sible for our college education. It merely
points out the fact that four years out of
a full life of three-score-and-ten is en-
tirely too short a period in which to get an
education. Some men are fortunate
enough to spend another two or three
years on a Master's Degree and a Ph.D.
in engineering, or some closely related
subject, but on the other hand, a larger
number have to face that mundane ques-
tion "When do we eat?" and must get
out into the working world and earn a
living.
What is there yet to learn after gradua-
tion that is a necessary part of our de-
velopment? If a new graduate is the
holder of an electrical degree, he must
determine which particular specialty he
will follow. Is he going to be a power
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


engineer or an electronics engineer? If
an electronics engineer, will he go into
radio broadcasting, radio receivers, or
electronic heating? In whatever of those
branches he may decide to specialize, he
must decide if he is going to be a design
engineer, a research engineer, a sales engi-
neer, a teacher, an operating engineer,
or take up any one of a hundred other
fields of endeavor, including that of man-
agement.
After he has selected his specialty and
found a position, he will discover that
there is a great deal to learn about that
particular field. It seems to be to be the
job of the employer to teach the new man
how to perform in his new field. Our in-
dustry has become so specialized that ac-
tually most businesses would rather have
a young man without previous experience
in order to train him not only in their
specialty but in their way of going at their
particular business, so that he may fit
into their team properly.
Sometimes this training comes as a bit
of a jolt. A man has been going from one
course to another in widely different field
in college and suddenly discovers that all
of his interests are concentrated on one
particular specialty. If he happens to
work in the electric utility industry with
which I am, of course, the most familiar,
he not only finds that he is working sole-
ly with the production of electricity and
not the utilization of it, but that he is
only designing overhead lines for the
distribution system and knows very little
about transmission, generation, or any
of the other phases of the power problem.
More than that, his efforts are confined
within the organization and he may not
have much opportunity to see how these
activities affect others outside his industry.
Right here is where many a good man
succumbe to inertia. When he was in
college, his courses were assigned to him
and they were graded, and he knew
whether he was progressing. On the job,
most employers see that he performs the
assigned task properly and that's all. Be-
yond this, it's up to the man. This may
be a hard-boiled attitude, but I wonder if
it isn't fair.
Any enterprise, whether it is a partner-
ship, a business corporation, or even a
governmental body, has certain funda-
mental obligations. In the case of a cor-
poration, for example, that obligation is
to produce a product and to make a rea-
sonable return for the owners. Men are
hired for their contribution to production
and profit.
However, we, as individuals, have an
obligation to ourselves to use a reasonable
portion of the mentality with which we
were endowed. No man is really happy
when he is using a small fraction of his
abilities. Should we not, then, use some
of the 16 hours of the day for which we
are not paid to learn a little something
outside our working field? Perhaps we
should read a little literature, go to new
plays, or learn how to be helpful to our
neighbors in community affairs. All this
tends to broaden our knowledge, make us
better citizens, and make us more satis-
fieed.
Even to succeed in business, we must go
a little beyond the requirements of the
job at hand. By that I mean we must
keep up with the current developments
not only in our own field but in closely
and distantly related fields, so that when
a new problem arises we may call upon
that store of other knowledge to bear on
the problem at hand.
At this point, I can't resist calling the
attention of this audience to the import-
ance of your professional engineering so-
ciety in furthering your education after
the completion of college. There is no
better way to keep up with the new de-
velopments in your particular field of en-
gineering than to read the papers, go to
the meetings, go to the conventions of
your professional engineering society.
The AIEE, with its 37,000 members, 45
technical committees, and the hundreds
of papers that are presented each year, has
something to offer that is new to every
electrical engineer in whatever specialty
he may be engaged. There is no better
place to go to acquire this new knowl-
edge. Some of it you may get firsthand
from your colleagues in your particular
job, but far more can be acquired from
people in related industries all over the
world who have given of their time to
write papers that you may read. You may
exchange ideas with your fellow engi-
neers by working on committees, as soon
as you have proved yourself willing and
able to carry on this activity.
Your engineernig society can be a very
important factor in another part of your
general education. Not the least of edu-
cation is the ability to get along with other
people. To do so, we must work with
them rather than against them, and the
engineering society is a remarkably help-
ful place in which to learn this. If you
have a man on your payroll, you may
order him to do something and he must
do it because you have the power to com-
pel him. But if you are working in an
engineering society, you can only get
people to do things because they like to do
them, and because they wish to work with
you. Nothing develops the ability to get
things done tactfully, gracefully, and
pleasantly quite so much as working in
this type of volunteer organization where
men work together because of mutual re-
spect and a spirit of service.
It is a thought-provoking fact that only
about a third of the practicing engineers
in the country belong to any professional
engineering society, and yet there is
scarcely any well-known or top-grade en-
gineer who does not belong to one. The
joining of an engineering society preced-
ed, rather than followed, their position of
prominence in the profession. Did they
progress because of joining an engineer-
ing society? Or, did the same good judg-
ment that made them successful make
them realize the importance of support-
ing their professional society In either
case, it is a good example.
Each time I read a technical paper on a
subject with which I am not familiar and
give it thorough study, I get a little feel-
ing of uplift that here is something new
and interesting that I should like to know
more about. And here is something for
which I can admire a fellow engineer
who has had the ability to come forward
with a new and valuable idea. It's just
like being cooped Up in a small room
until we discover a door which can be
opened. We open it into a new room of
knowledge, look ardund, and find it a
higher and wider room, and leading out
of that are several doors into other
branches of knowledge. No matter how
far we go, we find higher ceilings and
broader horizons, and more of the joy of
living which comes with not only being
better trained but with the knowledge and
anticipation that we have much to learn
and much farther to go to become edu-
cated men.

Defense Program Boosts Demand
for Engineers
Employment opportunities for engineer-
ing graduates have improved greatly since
early 1950, according to the U. S. Depart-
ment of Labor's Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics. The mobilization program has in-
creased the demand for engineers so much
that employers are now seeking additional
personnel, after absorbing the engineering
schools' record 1950 graduating class of
50,000. Hiring of engineers has been
much heavier in 1950 than in 1949, al-
though, in January, employers had report-
ed to the Engineers Joint Council that they
expected to hire fewer engineers this year
than last. As defense production rises
over the coming months, and the Armed
Forces are expanded, the demand for engi-
neers will increase further. Recent grad-
uates who may have entered non-engi-
neering positions can today find oppor-
tunities for engineering employment.
For high school students and others
considering whether to enter engineering
training, the profession offers very good
employment prospects, as indicated in the
Bureau's Occupational Outlook Summary
of March 8, 1950. This summary, which
was based on the assumption of peacetime
conditions, pointed out that the engineer-
ing profession has been one of the Na-
tion's fastest-growing occupations and will
probably remain so over the long run.
Defense mobilization will continue to add
to the peacetime demand for engineering
graduates for the next few years at least.
Moreover, the number of freshmen engi-
neering students has been declining since
1946, largely because of the drop in en-
rollments of veterans in U. S. colleges and
universities. As a result, the number of
graduates will decrease over the next sev-
eral years. According to estimates, which
are based on preliminary reports of 1950
fall enrollments to the U. S. Office of Edu-
cation and the American Society for Engi-
neering Education and which allow for
the normal number of drop-outs, the num-
ber of engineering graduates in 1954 will
partners in creating
K &amp; E drafting instruments, equipment and materials
have been partners of leading engineers forg| years
in shaping the modern world. So extensively are these
products used by successful men, it is self-evident that
K &amp; E has played a part in the completion of nearly
every American engineering project of any magnitude.

than the number of new graduates needed
each year to satisfy the average peace-
time demand (as estimated in Bureau of
Labor Statistics ulletin No. 968, "Employ-
ment Outlook for Engineers"). The drop
in engineering enrollments will be intensi-

Wetter Water is on the job
The smoke swells ... the flames roar ... firemen push
into the heart of the conflagration behind a wall of spray.
Then almost as if by magic the crackling flames die down
... the fire is out.
Wetter water is on the job again!
What is this remarkable fire fighting tool? How can
water be wetter? The answer is an astonishing chemical
called Unox Penetrant.
Add as little as one per cent of Unox Penetrant to water
and a wonderful change takes place. The water actually
becomes wetter . . . spreads rapidly and evenly . . . sinks al-
most instantly into any even slightly porous surface.
Sprayed on burning wallboard, wood, even bales of cot-
ton—wetter water penetrates below the burnt outside to the
fire beneath . . . puts it out faster with less than one-third
of the water usually needed.
Fire departments find that Unox Penetrant reduces fire,
smoke and water damage . . . makes the fireman's work
safer and more efficient. It is but one example of the hun-
dreds of materials produced by the people of Union Carbide.
Among these products there is certainly one or more that

schools. On the contrary, I think engi-
neering is still a man's field and will con-
tinue to be so for a long time to come.
Women have invaded many fields that
were thought to belong entirely to the
men, such as medicine and law; however,
engineering is unlike these professions in
that few women can ever become adept
at it. It is much easier to think of a
woman doctor or lawyer than it is to im-
agine a woman engineer. Maybe this sit-
uation will change in the future, maybe it
will not. The only reason I know of why
girls should study engineering is if they
have a very sincere liking for the sub-
ject. Courses like thermodynamics, theory
of structures, heat engines, and strength
of materials can be extremely boring and
therefore very difficult for a girl who does
not thoroughly enjoy engineering sub-
jects. On the other hand, if a girl does
have real interest in the course and if she
wants to enter the engineering school, the
doors should be open to her. And if she
makes the grade and succeeds in obtain-
ing her B.S. in engineering, then more
power to her!

Now you see it, now you don't! RCA's
new "vanishing microphone" is plainly
visible when standing alone—but let
a television performer stand before it
and it seems to disappear.
Called the "Starmaker," this RCA mi-
crophone is little larger than a big foun-
tain pen . . . and principles of design
based on modern camouflage techniques
blend it with an artist's clothing. There's
no clumsy "mike" to distract your atten-
tion from the artist's performance—and
it's also a superbly sensitive instrument.
Through research carried out at RCA Lab-
oratories, the "Starmaker" microphone picks
up sound from all directions—hears and
transmits every sound the human ear can
detect. It's not only small and almost invis-
ible, but it's also one of the most efficient
microphones ever devised.

When two lengths of elec-
trical conduit are joined
together, ordinarily the point of
coupling becomes the weakest
part of the run. For this reason
the coupling is all-important.
And for this reason a Sherardized
coupling has special advantages
over other types.

SHERARDUCT COUPLING
mm

ORDINARY COUPLING
A Sherardized coupling is gal-
vanized after the threads are cut—
every thread is zinc protected
against rust equally with the out-
side surface.
The shoulder on Sherarduct
couplings is a further safeguard.
It covers and protects the final
threads so that no raw threads
will be exposed to moisture and
other corrosive weather condi-
tions.
Sherarduct conduit threads are
so cut and couplings so tapped
causing conduit to butt, that to-
gether they form a practically
continuous raceway through
which wires may be drawn with-
out difficulty or injury.
Here at the joint, unless perfect
continuous grounding is assured
as it is with Sherarduct, rust first
begins its resistance activity and
acts as a barrier.

We are given to understand from gen-

Technic-Teasers article is that the prob-
lems were too easy. We are therefore pre-
senting some that are somewhat more
difficult.
We have one that has been a source of
argument for several weeks among the
Technic Staff. We have three cards that
are colored as follows; one has both sides
red, another has both sides white, and
the third has one side red and the other

these three cards, draw one out and lay
it on the table. You find yourself looking

you win. Has he offered you the right

Imagine a pier pile in the shape of a
cylinder having a cross-sectional diameter
of one foot. The pile is surrounded by
wharves as shown in the figure such that
the length of the pile sides of the wharves
are each twenty one feet. You desire to
reach the pile, but all the equipment you
have on hand are two pieces of lumber
each ten feet long. Now friction isn't
enough to keep the boards from falling
into the water. Can you get across?
While studying here at the University
we became acquainted with a book worm
who suggested the following problem.
Consider twenty volumes lined up on a
bookshelf. Each has a cover thickness of
one quarter inch. Thus if each book is one
inch thick, how far does the worm travel
in going from the first page of the first
book to the last page of the last book?
We also know a fly who recently pass-
ed away. There is a tale to his demise. It
seems that there were two bicyclists riding
toward each other at a speed of fifteen
miles per hour. When they were sixty
miles apart, this fly we knew, in a mo-
ment of insanity, started playing tag with
the wheels of the bicycles. He flew from
the wheel of one bicycle to the wheel of
the other bicycle and back to the first and
so on, at a speed of twenty miles per hour.
Alas, this continued until the bicycles met
and the fly, too exhausted to move fast
enough, was crushed between the wheels.
Now, what we were wondering is how far
did that fly travel back and forth to ex-
haust himself so?
We have one that is appropriate to the
season. It began snowing here in Ann
Arbor at a heavy and steady rate. A snow
plow started out to clear the road at noon.
It went two miles by one o'clock and one

more mile by two a'clock. The question
is, what time did it begin to snow?
In the realm of algebra there is a prob-
lem simple so far as actual manipulation
goes but necessitating clear reasoning.
This problem is stated as follows—a ship
is twice as old as its captain was when the
ship was as old as its captain is. The sum
of their ages in 49. How old is the ship?
With the consent of the Technic edi-

The Inside Story of Engine Deposits
Engineers have long known that de-
posits which accumulate in gasoline
engines have a direct bearing on en-
gine performance. Even now, how-
ever, no way has been found to elim-
inate these deposits or their effects.
As a manufacturer of chemicals
used by the petroleum industry, the
Du Pont Company has a particular
interest in this problem. It is cur-
rently the subject of a comprehensive
research project, conducted both on
the road and in the laboratory.
When Du Pont engineers began
their studies, some aspects of the re-
lationships between engine, fuel, lu-
bricant, operating conditions and de-
posits were known. But to understand
how and why deposits form and to
develop corrective measures, they
needed additional information.
Engineers take to the road
To get these facts, Du Pont engi-
neers are supervising tests in a fleet
of passenger cars and trucks that
travel hundreds of thousands of miles
yearly under carefully controlled con-
ditions. The effects of deposits on
octane number requirement, valve
performance, spark plug condition
and other performance characteris-
tics are measured. After each test,
the deposits are weighed and ex-
amined physically and chemically.
In the laboratory, other engineers
study the effects of the same vari-
ables on multicylinder engines. Here,
where closer control of the engines is
possible, greater attention can be
paid to specific fuel or engine operat-
ing effects. Performance factors, such
as power output, can be more con-
veniently measured.
A third group of Du Pont engineers
uses single cylinder engines in lab-
oratory studies of deposit formation,
adhesion, removal and harm. Explor-
ing new fields, these men had to de-
sign complex instrumentation for
measuring factors such as surface
condition and deposit thickness.
Chemists synthesize deposits
Chemists, too, have an important
place in this research. They study
the chemical and physical character-
istics of engine deposits. Among other
things, they devise ways of synthe-
sizing, in fired engines, deposits con-
sisting almost entirely of a single
chemical compound in order to study
its effect on engine performance.
The results of this comprehensive
research program are not yet con-
clusive, although the relationships
between engine, fuel, lubricant, op-
erating condition and deposit forma-
tion and harm are much better un-
derstood. In the past Du Pont scien-
tists have licked even more difficult
problems. Working as a team, they
will persist in their effort to provide
the motorist with improved engine
performance through better fuels.

That is, the converter is used mainly to provide the starting
ratios and in high gear it is mechanically locked up. There-
fore the power flows through a shaft and no longer through
the fluid of the torque converter, The virtue of this system is
to remove the slip that is present with fluid coupling and there-
fore increase the overall fuel economy. To best illustrate why
the Ford transmission does not have this feature is shown by
Fig. 2. The dotted lines on this graph are top gear and next
to top gear tractive effort curves necessary to secure the equiv-
alent of 97 cubic feet per ton mile in the top gear. The figure
of 97 cubic feet per ton mile was taken as the average of 5
leading cars now being sold with hydramatic. They therefore
represent the engineering requirement and customer preference
at this time. Apparently, this is necessary so that shift down
is not required for good performance at low car speeds. Also
on this graph are shown the solid line curves which represent
the equivalent of 85 cubic feet per ton mile in top gear. If
the converter is left in the circuit the curves show a gain in
tractive effort below 48 M.P.H. Therefore the value of area
A is gained without any shift down in the gear box. Of
course the amount of ratio can be varied by depending on the
throttle requirements. This condition is effective down to 20
miles per hour, below which shift down will occur without
full throttle and thereby place operation in intermediate gear
The next graph Figure 3 shows the full throttle and road
load slip curves as applied against the 3.31 axle equivalent to
85 cubic feet per ton mile. Also shown on this graph are

curves for a 3.78 to 1 axle which is equal to 97 cubic feet per
ton mile, and the curve for 3.54 axle job which is equal to 91
cubic feet per ton mile without slip, or as though it were
locked up. It is seen from these curves that the average engine
R.P.M. of 3.31 axle job with converter in the circuit are
somewhat lower than those of solid drive job with a 3.54 to 1
axle, and considerable amount lower than if it were con-
sidered necessary to have'97 cubic feet per ton mile with
a 3.98 axle ratio. A point to note is that the amount that the
3.31 job curves are above the straight lines is proportional
to the slip. Now from the standpoint of fuel economy the
interpretation of the graph would point to the non locked
up converter with the 3-31 axle. Or as a result by leaving the
converter in the circuit we put more zip in the low end of the
top gear which can be adapted to performance requirements.
Also as an overall result it is possible to use a lower axle ratio
which results in increased fuel economy. In fact in Mr.
Youngren's report a transmission with a two speed gear box
plus a converter was compared with the 3 speed Ford unit and
the result was a slower engine speed for the Ford job.
In conclusion, engineering development of the unit is such
that in the interest of good flexible performance and good fuel
economy a 3 speed gear box coupled with a non-locked up con-
verter are the makeup of the Ford-Mercury automatic trans-
mission.
Figure 4 shows a cross section view of the Ford-Mercury
automatic transmission. The gear box is of the planetary type,
to permit shifting under torque, employing a gear set of the
double pinion type with two sun gears and one internal gear.
This total of nine gears provide 3 forward ratios, two geared,
one direct and one reverse ratio.
Two multiple disc clutches and two hand brakes all hydrau-
lically activated, determine the path through which the power
flows in the various gear ratios. Two oil pumps, one coupled
to the input shaft and one coupled to the output shaft, serves

The control system consists of a pres-

stand the high loads involved, while the
front band lever is of die cast construc-

mission is somewhat more complicated
than a standard 2 speed job since it must
provide 3 forward speeds and one reverse.
The power flow through the transmission
for the different ratios are as follows.
In neutral both clutches and bands are
disengaged. In low the front clutch is
engaged and the rear band is engaged.
In intermediate the front clutch is engag-
ed and the front band is engaged. In
high, both clutches are engaged and both
bands are off, resulting in a direct drive
through the transmission in which all the
parts rotate together. For reverse the rear
c'utch is engaged and the rear band is
engaged. It is shown from previous de-
scriptions that the rear band would have
to be able to stand high torque loads (ap-
proximately 6 times engine torque at stall
in reverse) since it is used at low and
reverse. The band is wider and heavier
than the front band and of the single
wrap variety. It employs a .050 inch
semi-metallic friction facing cemented to
relevant to the bands since they seem to
be the center of trouble in some of »the
earlier transmissions.
The torque converter consists of three
basic elements, the pump, the turbine and
one stator or reaction member. The pump
is driven from the engine through a flex-
ible plate for a minimum of vibration
transfer. Tte pump assembly, consists
of an aluminum cover, 31 stamped steel
blades, a retaining ring, a torus ring, and
iron hub casting. The aluminum cover
is die-cast with slots provided in the in-
side surface to receive the blade tabs.
Each blade is positioned in the cover by
four tabs and the retaining ring. An ad-
ditional two tabs project through the
torus ring and are rolled over to com-
plete the assembly. The hub, which is
bolted on and sealed with a synthetic
ring of square section, provide support
for the rear of the converter and in addi-
tion carries two drive lugs for the front
oil pump of the gear box.
The turbine assembly, is made of steel
stampings except for the splined hub
which is a steel forging. The 33 blades
are located in the outer shell by four tabs
extending from the blade through the
shell and held in place by the bending of
the tabs. The torus ring is slipped into
place over two additional tabs on each
blade and these tabs are bent over by roll-
ing. The steel hub is riveted to the outer
shell to complete the assembly. The stator
or reaction member is an aluminum die-
casting on which a formed split steel
shroud is assembled and retained by weld-
ing at the split. The remaining parts in
the converter consist of washers which
take the thrust between the pump, stator,
and turbine, and the assembly of pieces
which makes up the hub of the stator.
The outer race of the over-running clutch
is splined on the outside diameter to re-
ceive the aluminum stator and is retained
in the stator by snap rings in conjunction
with the two supports. The supports are
fitted closely to the inside diameter of
the outer race at each end and are mount-
ed on babbitt bushings which fit over the
inner race of the over-running clutch.
This accurately positions the inner and
outer races and provides for the proper
working of the sprag type over-running
clutch which is nested in the center of
this hub assembly. The above manufactur-
ing techniques in conjunction with the
simplicity of the fundamental design of
the converter have resulted in an economi-
cal fabrication without compromise to the
performance objectives. The cooling of
the converter and transmission oil is
accomplished primarily by air circulation
through the converter housing. Fins cast
on the pump cover serve the dual purpose
of providing cooling surface and vanes
for pumping cooling air. The air is drawn
in through the inlet at the bottom left
side, passes through the converter hous-
ing by centrifugal action, and is ex-
hausted at the bottom right side. The heat
transfer is of course directly through the
aluminum pump cover into the air stream.
This means of cooling is simple, with no
plumbing necessary as in a water-cooled
job and imposes no extra load on the
engine cooling system.
The control of the Ford-Mercury auto-
matic transmission is a composite of two
functions. The major one is the driver

PROBLEM—You're designing a taxi-cab meter. You have
worked out the mechanism that clocks waiting time and
mileage and totals the charges. Your problem now is to
provide a drive for the meter from some operating part of
the cab—bearing in mind that the meter must be located
where the driver can read it and work the flag. How would
you do It?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use an S.S.White power drive
flexible shaft. Connect one end to a take-off on the trans-
mission and the other to the meter. It's as simple as that—a
single mechanical element that is easy to install and will oper-
ate dependably regardless of vibration and tough usage.
That's the way a leading taximeter manufacturer does ir
as shown below.

verse and low when considered necessary. This is entirely
possible since there are no gears to engage in such shifting.
Extensive use has been made of aluminum die-castings in
the Ford-Mercury automatic transmission. There are a total
of 24 die castings, 4 in the converter and the remainder in the
gear box. As a result the complete automatic transmission in-
stallation is approximately 77 lbs. over that of the standard
transmission.
One of the considerations of the engineers at the Ford
Motor Company was that of service accessibility. They design-
ed the transmission so that the gear box can be readily removed
from the converter housing by removing the four case-to-
housing screws, thereby leaving the converter assembly intact.
All control elements such as pressure regulator assembly,
valve body assembly, front and rear servos can be readily re-
moved from be.ow after the oil pan is removed. The gear box
is of straight forward and simple assembly and there are few
adjustments involved, so that propsr servicing of the transmis-
sion is comparatively simple.
In an overall comprehensive view of the Ford-Mercury
transmission, we find a comparatively high efficiency unit some-
v. hat at the expense of a more complicated gear box. However,
it is rather hard to say whether this is an actual drawback.
But in any case I am inclined to feel that it is a good start
in the right direction. Of course in the future we can expect
improvement as to efficiency and operational characteristics. As
in the case of any engineering development the prool of the
pudding is in the eating, therefore, the people who will pass
final judgment are the owners of the new Fords.

TIMKEN bearings
Big, heavy-duty pipeline valves have to be designed
so that they can be opened and closed in a jiffy with
a minimum of effort. To meet this problem, engineers
mount the turning mechanism on Timken* tapered
roller bearings. Timken bearings take both the radial
and thrust loads imposed by the valve action. And
they reduce friction to a minimum.
Why TIMKEN* bearings
practically eliminate friction
Timken bearings are a precision product, manu-
factured to microscopic tolerances and finished to
incredible smoothness to assure true rolling motion.
The diagram at the right shows clearly how true roll-
ing motion is obtained. Notice that lines produced
coincident with the faces of the rollers, cup and cone
meet at a common point at the axis of the bearing.

Leaders come from men who devote their time
to purposeful work, constructive study and
thoughtful concentration . . . men who are will-
ing to invest their time to prepare for an
opportunity.
They must believe in themselves, and be pre-
pared with a solid background of knowledge,
experience and skill that qualifies them for
greater responsibility.
Westinghouse management knows that men
who invest their time in self improvement are
good prospects for top positions. It accepts the
responsibility for supporting these men in
pursuing their ambitions by providing the latest
facilities, graduate-level instruction and prac-
tical individual guidance.
With the opening of its new Educational Cen-
ter, Westinghouse has taken another step in
broadening its support of men who believe there
is room at the top... and who will back it up with
their own effort and enthusiasm. We believe it can
only result in more room at the top . . . for those
who believe in their own potentialities and have
the will and courage to develop them. G-10117

Vv ith its unbroken horizontal tiers of grey brick curtain walls
which "seem to float in thin air", acres of glass their only visible means
of support, the new home of The Florsheim Shoe Company in Chicago
might be called an industrial "dream home".
It is certainly one of America's most notable examples of future-
minded planning. Like the production machines used in cutting, lasting,
stitching, and finishing Florsheim Shoes, the equipment installed for build-
ing operation is the most efficient modern engineering has devised.
Here, Jenkins Valves "fit perfectly".
In fact, because of their dependability, safety and lasting economy, Jenkins
Valves have been the choice, consistently, of leading architects, engineers
and contractors for the towering skyscrapers, huge industrial plants, and
super airports that are making today's building news.
They know Jenkins builds extra endurance into valves — proved by
low upkeep cost records in every type of service. Yet, despite this extra value,
they pay no more for Jenkins Valves. For new installations, for all replace-
ments, the Jenkins Diamond is their guide to lasting valve economy.

When is a liquid not a liquid?
It often seems that research moves in strange ways to solve
problems. Take the case of the liquid liquids . . . products of
the Dow laboratories. Called Dowanols, these chemicals offer
industry a valuable tool, liquids that remain liquid over a
temperature range of 390 degrees. In addition, they have manv
other physical characteristics that make them extremely helpful
to the processing industries. Their solvent power, for instance,
is remarkable . . . for Dowanols are miscible in all proportions
with fluids from water and olive oil to benzene. This wide
solvent range leads to their use in many applications where
stabilizing action is required: cutting oils, printing inks, rust
removers, dry cleaning soaps, textile finishing compounds and
many others.
Dowanols are but one of a wide range of products resulting
from a program of continuing research carried on by Dow in
the interest of producing more "Chemicals Indispensable to
Industry and Agriculture."

The Oak Ridge School of
Reactor Technology
Applications are now being received
by the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Tech-
nology for enrollment in the 1951-52
session, beginning September 10, 1951.
This School was established at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in March of
1950 under sponsorship of the U. S.
Atomic Energy Commission. Its purpose
is to train engineers and scientists in the
field of reactor theory and technology, in
preparation for their employment in this
field by the AEC or its contractors.
The Oak Ridge School of Reactor Tech-
nology will enroll students of outstanding
qualifications who hold, or will receive by
September 1951, bachelor's or master's
degrees in chemistry, engineering, metal-
lurgy or physics. A limited number of
recent college graduates will be accepted
under Category A in the status of student-
employees of the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, and will be paid a monthly
stipend for a twelve-month period, be-
ginning September 1951.
Provision is also made for trainees
sponsored by government agencies and
industrial organizations connected with
or interested in the AEC reactor develop-
ment program, Category B. Applications
for enrollment under this category must be
made by the firms or agencies employing
the applicants. Such students remain on
the payrolls of their home organizations.
Much of the material presented in the
curriculum of the Oak Ridge School of
Reactor Technology will be classified;
hence, all enrollments are contingent upon
a personnel security investigation.
Men trained in chemistry, engineering,
metallurgy or physics are much in demand
in the reactor development program. It is
the purpose of the Oak Ridge School of
Reactor Technology to provide engineers
and scientists with sufficient background
in reactor technology and allied subjects
to become effective as research, develop-
ment and design personnel.
Literature and application forms have
been forwarded to engineering depart-
ments and personnel offices of most in-
stitutions. Further information and appli-
cation forms may be obtained by writ-
ing to the Director, Oak Ridge School of
Reactor Technology, Post Office Box P,
Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Category for
which application is requested must be
specified. These applications must be filed
with the director of the school by March
1, 1951. Announcements of appointments
will be made in April 1951.
Employment, Education, and Earnings
of American Men of Science
Salary levels of the Nation's top scient-
ists are considerably lower in colleges and
universities than in either government or
private industry. Earnings are highest in
private industry not only for the entire
group of scientists but also for those in
each age group, in every scientific field,
and in every region of the country.
This is one of the major findings of a
study of the employment, education, and
earnings of the country's leading scient-
ists. The study, which covers 40,000 of
the 52,000 scientists listed in the 1949
edition of the biographical directory
"American Men of Science," was made by
the U. S. Department of Labor's Bureau
of Labor Statistics in cooperation with the
Department of Defense.
The scientists studied were predom-
inantly research workers. Next to re-
search, teaching was the activity most
often reported.
Chemists were by far the largest group,
comprising about one-fourth of the scient-
ists in the survey. The biologists were sec-
ond and the engineers third, although the
total number of engineers in the country
exceeds the total number of professional
workers in all other scientific fields com-
bined.
Educational institutions were the prin-
cipal field of employment for these lead-
ing scientists, with private industry second
and government third. Thirty-seven per-
cent were employed solely by universities
and colleges at the time of the survey, and
an additional 13 percent combined edu-
cation with some other type of employ-
ment. The proportion of scientists work-
ing exclusively for private industry was
27 percent, for government agencies 14
percent.
One of the main purposes of the sur-
vey was to provide a roster of the out-
standing individuals in every branch of
natural science, and about two-thirds of
the nation's Ph.D.'s in the natural sci-
ences were covered by the study. The
small proportion of scientists in the sur-
vey who did not have doctorates usually
held either master's or M.D. degrees.
For Ph.D.'s in all specialties taken to-
gether, the median salary in private in-
dustry was $7,070 a year, in government
$6,280 a year, and in education $4,860.
The engineers had the highest median
salary and the biologists the lowest in
every type of employment. So important,
however, was the difference in salary levels
as between one type of employer and an-
other that the biologists working for busi-
ness firms tended to earn more than the
engineers on the college campus.
The older men received higher salaries
than their younger colleagues, whatever
the type of employment, but median sal-
aries tended to increase more rapidly with
age in private industry than in any other
type of employment.
Supplementary professional incomes
were reported by a much larger proportion
of the educators than of the scientists em-
ployed in either private industry or gov-
ernment. However, this extra income by
no means made up the difference in salary
levels between education and other em-
ployment.
Brr-r-r-r!
So you think it's cold? Perish the
thought.
There's a spot along the Mohawk River
where it's 452 degrees below zero!
It's in the low temperature laboratory
of the General Electric Company's Re-
search Laboratory where scientists study
the properties of materials at temperatures
near absolute zero, or 459.69 degrees be-
low zero, Fahrenheit.
To obtain these low temperatures, the
scientists need liquid helium. Manufac-
turing of liquid helium begins with liquid
nitrogen, which has a temperature of 320
degrees below zero.
Using the liquid nitrogen, they next
produce liquid hydrogen, at a temperature
of 423 degrees below zero.
Last step in the process is producing
liquid helium with its 452 degrees below
zero temperature.
This low temperature, according to the
scientists, is merely liquid helium's boiling
point. There is no freezing point, except
under very high pressure.
When helium freezes over, it'll really
be cold! (Continued on page 26)

Here is a problem now that will be
hard or easy depending on how you look
at it. A man rowing up stream at a con-
stant speed in the water noted a bottle
floating in the water opposite his boat
just as he was passing a pier. He con-
tinued rowing upstream for one half hour,
then he turned around and rowed down-
stream, still at the same speed relative to
the water. He met the bottle again two
miles downstream from the pier one hour
later. What is the speed of the rowboat.
We have something we got out of a
thirty-five year old book. It goes like this
—at a humble inn where there were only
six rooms, seven travelers applied for
lodging, each insisting on having a room
to himself. The landlord put the first man
in room number one and asked one of the
other men to stay there also for a few
minutes. He then put the third man in
room number two, the fourth man in
room number three, the fifth man in
room number four, and the sixth man in
room number five. Then returning to
room number one he took the seventh
man and put him in room number six.
Therefore each man had his own room—
or did he?
We have one now that we have heard
off and on for many years. It goes like
this—a town is situated on the border be-
tween two countries A and B. Due to the
confused international situation a dollar
in B's currency is worth ninety'Cents in
A's currency while a dollar in A's currency
is worth ninety cents of B's currency.
Now one day a citizen of A strolls into a
saloon in B and orders a ten cent beer.
He pays for it with a B dollar, receiving
in change an A dollar which is just ninety
cents in B. This good citizen then returns
to A and entering a saloon orders another
ten cen beer, paying for it with the A
dollar he has. He receives for change a
B dollar which is just ninety cents in A.
This process is very enthusiastically con-
tinued by our good citizen until he is
satiated. This occurs when he has a B
dollar in his pocket.
It appears that our good citizen has
guzzled beer all day without payment. We
would like to know who paid for the beer.
We are in some difficulty at the present
time. While visiting at a friend's house
recently we noticed his young daughter
spill water over her arithmetic problems.
This naturally blurred the problems and,
as a matter of fact, left one looking like
thiS:
xx7xx
xxxx7x\/xx7xxxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxx7x
xxxxxxx
x7xxxx
x7xxxx
xxxxxxx
xxxx7xx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
The x's represent blurred numbers.
Now we promised to fill in the numbers
the x's stand for. Can you offer any sug-
gestions on how to do this?
One of the less widely known tales
from The Arabian Nights goes something
like this:
There were summoned to the palace of
a powerful Caliph three wise men. As a
matter of fact they were the wisest men
in the land. Upon their arrival in court
they found themselves presented with the
following problem, the correct solution
of which would assure the continued
close proximity of their respective heads
and shoulders. The problem was this:
They were shown five hats of which
three were white and two were black.
They were then told that of these five
hats one would be placed on each of their
heads and each would be asked to name

MURRAY H. MILLER
the color of the hat that rested on his
head. The Caliph placed a white hat on
each of the wise men's heads and—. Now
we've forgotten how this ends. We know
each of the wise men answered correctly
but we don't remember how he got the
answer. Do you know?
* * *
We have a final problem one that is
simple and yet can pave the way for great
difficulties. Consider the railroad track
and sidings as shown in the figure. A
locomotive and two freight cars are lo-
cated as shown. The common position of
the siding MN can hold only one of the
freight cars. It can not hold the loco-
motive. How would you go about inter-
changing the positions of the freight
cars?

We are given to understand that several
of the Technic's readers have some pet
teasers that they would like to put to the
Technic brain trust in an effort to stump
us. We will offer a prize to anyone who
can mail us a brain teaser, care of The
Michigan Technic, which we cannot solve.
We will also print, with proper credit, the
more interesting of those problems we
receive.

DIGEST
Bringing Up Alathon
*
Du Pont scientists find
great promise in this young
member of the wax family
One of the most interesting and ver-
satile of the new plastics is Du Pont
"Alathon" polythene resin, chemical
cousin of paraffin.
Because of its unusual combination
of properties, it is now being used in
everything from "squeeze-bottles"
for toiletries to cable insulation and
chemical-resistant linings.
"Alathon" was born when English
scientists used high-pressure synthe-
sis to create polythene, the solid and
semi-solid polymers of ethylene.
Du Pont scientists and others
added their background in high pres-
sure work to the field of ethylene
polymers. This concerted effort pro-
duced a greatly expanded range of
uses.
Taking First Steps
The first step of Du Pont chemists
and engineers was to produce poly-
thene in the laboratory to confirm
earlier findings. Then the product
was turned over to chemical engi-
neers for pilot-plant work. Finally, a
plant for full-scale commercial pro-
duction was designed by chemical,
mechanical and electrical engineers
and metallurgists.
Many of the most promising uses

Blow-molded "Alathon" bottle, with molded
closure. It emits a fine spray when squeezed.
for "Alathon" could not be realized
until technical difficulties were over-
come. For example, the chemical in-
ertness, which is one of the outstand-
ing properties of the material in film
form, also made the casting of film
from solution impractical because it
could not be dissolved in suitable
solvents. In devising a special extru-
sion technique to solve this problem,
Du Pont engineers opened up a whole
new field of possibilities.

Mulliwall bags for chemicals and foods are
made of kraft paper coated with "Alathon."
Acid-Defying Paper
In film form, "Alathon" lends its
strength, chemical inertness and re-
sistance to grease and moisture to
packages for chemicals, foods, metal
parts and moisture-sensitive pow-
ders. In still another form in which
these properties are employed, paper
coated with "Alathon" is used as
wrapping for bakery products and
moistureproof containers for chem-
icals that would attack uncoated
paper. (Experimentally, "Alathon"
coated paper has been exposed to con-
centrated sulfuric acid for days with-
out harm; the same paper, uncoated,
was ruined within a few minutes.)
The protection of "Alathon" was
extended to metal tanks and drums
when Du Pont engineers developed
a spray-flaming coating technique.
In the field of electricity, too,
"Alathon" is proving of great value.
Its outstanding electrical properties

All "Alathon"—ice-cube trays, refrigerator
bowls, tableware and protective coverings.

Pipe made of "Alathon" is used for handling
corrosive chemicals, solutions and gases.
make it an ideal insulator for wire
and cable, particularly in the high-
frequency applications necessary in
television and radar.
"Alathon" in powder form is used
for molding a wide range of light,
tough and flexible plastic articles.
In addition to bottles, these include
tumblers, dishes, jar caps and ice-
cube trays. Extruded as a film, it
serves for garment covers, tablecloths
and rainwear.
The future looks bright for "Ala-
thon." New applications such as ex-
truded pipe for mines and separators
for storage batteries seem about to be
realized. Other uses yet undreamed
of will no doubt emerge from the
close, continuous teamwork of tech-
nical men that typifies Du Pont
research. 'keo.u. b.mt.off.

fT^His picture story had whiskers when John A. Roebling huilt the Brooklyn
Bridge, 85 years ago. • But the warning it sounds is as current and as urgent
as it ever was in the history of our country. • No mule ever will get much of a meal
by pursuing hay that is kept out of his reach by a stout pole. • No nation whose
rising wage scale keeps prices spiraling upward ever will attain true prosperity. •
No nation has yet found the secret of making products at prices that do not depend
upon wages. • If we expect to stop the inflation spiral we're in, we will have to
contribute more, individually, instead of merely collecting more, individually. •
And let us not lose sight of this objective during periods of government controls
that are temporarily forced upon us by national emergencies. Let us keep our
eye on the long range picture. Let us remember that we can have more only if we
give more...that we can not really increase our income, unless we also increase
our productivity. • Inflation wages can no more catch up with inflation prices than
our mule can catch up with that elusive hay. John A. Roebling's Sons Co.,

"...provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare..."
V-/IL helps in the practical realization of
these words from our nation's Constitution.
America's machine power, once again strain-
ing to meet both civilian and military
demand, depends on the skill of trained
technical men to avoid costly shutdowns, to
keep continuously on the job.
Throughout the history of machines, cor-
rosion has been one of their deadliest ene-
mies. Standard Oil has always endeavored
to improve its industrial oils, to make them
not just better lubricants but more effective
rust inhibitors as well.
Our industrial oils contain newly devel-
oped additives that prevent much of the
trouble caused by corrosion in bearings and
moving parts. These oils have the ability to
form protective surfaces on areas subject to
corrosive forces. They cut down lost time
that robs machinery of its ability to produce.
Yes, there's more to "oil" than just oil.
Standard Oil research, which looks to
America's engineering colleges for new
blood, is constantly facing and solving prob-
lems so as to increase efficiency and pack
more hours and days into each year of
machine operation—at a time when even
minutes count.

Would you like to measure very small
changes in length, as small as 1/100000
of an inch. Or maybe you are interested
in larger values. Other problems you
might have are measuring the temperature
of a small part of a machine during opera-
tion, or measuring the amount of fuel in a
tank several miles away without making a
journey, or the moisture content of cloth
emerging from a textile drier. These in-
teresting types of measurement are few
of many applications of electrical bridges.
Electronic control and electrical meas-
urement are two fields which have become
more and more important in branches of
engineering other than electrical engineer-
ing. All engineers should have an under-
standing of the many basic principles of
these two fields and an idea of how these
principles have been applied in their own
particular branch of engineering. The
purpose of this article is to discuss the
"bridge circuit", and to show how ideas

BATTEHY
Fig. I. The Wheatstone Bridge—the
most widely used method for the preci-
sion measurement of electrical resis-
tance.
for the applications mentioned in the
first paragraph resulted from an under-
standing of simple bridge theory.
The D-C Bridge
The Wheatstone bridge, a direct current
(D-C) instrument, is the most widely
used method for the precision measure-
ment of electrical resistance. It consists
of four resistance arms, a battery, and
some sort of detector, usually a galvano-
menter. The circuit is shown in Fig. 1.
Remembering Ohm's Law, which states
BY
ROBERT E. FRESE '5IE
that voltage is the product of current
times resistance (E = IR), we see that
the current through the galvanometer de-
pends on the voltage difference between
points B and D in Fig. 1. Since Ra and
R4 have a common point at A, the current
through the galvanometer depends on the
difference in voltage drops across R, and
R4. This current may flow in either direc-
tion depending on which of these voltage
drops is the greater. A balanced condi-
tion exists when no current flows through
the galvanometer, requiring that the vol-
tage from A to B equal the voltage from
A to D. Using Ohm's law at balance,
I,R. = I4R4 (1)
Since the galvanometer current is zero, I,
equals I2 and I3 equals I4. By calling the

The unknown resistance will be exter-
nal to the bridge circuit. Rx and R2 may
be fixed and R3 may be a variable resis-
tance with a calibrated scale which reads
values of R4 directly. However, any type
of measurement can be made if the meas-
urement can be transformed to a change
of electrical resistance. The scale may
then be calibrated to read directly in the
units desired. If a wide range of values is
necessary then the RjiRj ratio may be ad-
justed in steps to provide a scale multi-
plier.
The measurement of resistance does
not depend on the characteristics or the
calibration of the galvanomenter, pro-
vided that it has sufficient sensitivity to
enable the balance point (zero current) to
be determined as accurately as desired.

been in the electrical strain gage. The
"SR-4 Strain Gage" is one type that has
found wide use. Several loops of very fine
resistance wire are cemented to a thin strip
of paper. See Fig. 2. This assembly is
cemented to the specimen. The bonding
area of the cement is sufficient to cause
the gage wire to stretch the same amount
as the specimen. The gage wire is used as
one arm of a Wheatstone bridge. An
adjacent arm of the Wheatstone bridge
consists of an identical coil of gage wire
cemented to a free piece of the same ma-
terial as the specimen. This compensates
for any temperature change during a test.
The other two arms consist of a variable
resistance with a scale calibrated in micro-

inches per inch, and a resistance which is
changed in steps to give a wider range.
After an initial zero reading is taken
changes in strain are recorded on the cali-
brated dial. All readings are taken with
the galvanometer balanced at zero. The
smallest scale division is 1/1,000,000 of
an inch.
The range of the strain gage may be
extended by building and calibrating a
cantilever beam arrangement as shown
in Fig. 3. The strain along the beam is
a function of the deflection at the free end.
Once a calibration constant has been
found for the particular position of the
strain gage, the deflection of the free end
can be computed for the strain readings.
Temperature Compensator
We mentioned that the SR-4 type strain
gage was compensated for change in tem-
perature. This suggests the use of a simi-
lar gage to measure temperature. Many
alloys have been found whose resistance

About the largest and most accurate
electronic analogue computer ever built
to evaluate the performance of guided
missiles, ships, airplanes, submarines and
aid in the air protection of American cities
is in operation at the Radio Corporation
of America's Princeton laboratories.
"Designated 'Project Typhoon,' the new
electronic computer is expected to save
many millions of dollars in the design of
guided missiles and also solve many
riddles encountered in the air defense of
our cities," said Dr. C. B. Jolliffe, Execu-
tive Vice President in Charge of RCA
Laboratories Division. "Complex simu-
lated problems of a complete guided mis-
sile system, which other computers are too
small or too inaccurate to handle effec-
tively, can be solved by Typhoon. This
will enable the design of equipment with
a minimum of experiments that would
require expensive apparatus, such as mis-
siles, airplanes and ships."
Dr. Jolliffe predicted that the RCA elec-
tronic analogue computer will play a sig-
nificant role in military science of the
future. Very often the construction of an
experimental guided missile may cost more
than $100,000, he pointed out, and unless
its characteristics are properly checked in
advance by accurate computing techni-
ques, actual launchings may be failures
resulting in the loss of instruments and
apparatus. With Typhoon, any missile
problem can be solved over and over,
with the characteristics varied each
time until the desired results are obtained.
Thus, by avoiding costly trial and error
tests, the new computer can, with a high
degree of accuracy, assure scientists how
a proposed missile will react under actual
flight conditions.
The new analogue calculator employs
approximately 4,000 electron tubes, sev-
eral miles of intricate wiring and a new
set of super accurate components, exact
to better than one part of 25,000. Under
contract with the Special Devices Center
of the Office of Naval Research, engineers
of RCA Laboratories designed and built
the instrument for use by the Navy Bu-
reau of Aeronautics. Three years of re-
search and development work directed by
Arthur W. Vance, Head of the Electronic-
Computer Section of RCA Laboratories,
preceded actual construction of the com-
puter.
Computer Demonstration
At a recent demonstration, the com-
puter was shown solving a simulated air
defense problem wherein a high-speed
bomber was successfully attacked by a
radar-controlled, supersonic rocket-pro-
pelled guided missile. The missile was
guided with deadly accuracy to the tar-
get.
AH information necessary to solve the
problem was introduced to the machine
by means of more than 100 dials and a
portion of 6,000 plug-in switchboard con-
started functioning according to prede-
termined equations.
While the instrument was engaged in
its electronic thinking process, the paths
of both the high-speed bomber and the
rocket-propelled guided missile were
traced respectively by red and green pens
on two large plotting boards. From these
charts, which provided a permanent rec-
ord of the test flight, skilled technicians

nections, mounted on the tall panel sec-
tions of the computer. Different dial posi-
tions and plug connections represented
such characteristics as aerodynamics of the
missile, loss of weight due to fuel con-
sumption, and radar signals which follow
the missile and target. Other adjustments
accounted for the autopilot or gyro stabi-
lizers of the missile, the path and velocity
of the target, and the main guidance sys-
tem to be used for directing the missile
toward the target in the most effective
manner.
An instant after the computer was put
into operation by the throwing of a switch
at the main control console, electrical im-
pulses flowed through Typhoon's thous-
ands of electron tubes and wires. Within
the device, electrical currents and voltages
began representing physical things such
as distance, velocity and force. Circuits
were able to determine the exact position
of the missile at any given time.
A Model "Dog Fight"
A three-dimension visual representation
of the "dog fight" as it progressed was
provided for spectators by an auxiliary
device, called the trajectory model, in
which two suspended fluorescent balls
traveled the identical course of the mis-
sile and target. At the same time, a small
scale missile model, 12 inches long and
3!/2 inches in diameter, moved about on a
rotating mechanism to simulate perform-
ance of the anti-aircraft missile under
test. As the model received control signals
or instructions from the computer describ-
ing how best to hit the target without
wasting too much time or fuel, its three
sets of fins were deflected as the corre-

Many of us are faced with a problem
that does not lend itself to a thorough
theoretical analysis because it becomes too
complicated. These same problems may
also be very difficult to handle by a com-
pletely experimental approach. As an ex-
ample, let us attempt to determine the
forces developed during the landing of an
airplane. Specifically, we want to know
what factors determine the force between
the ground and the tires, how this force
varies with these factors, and what the
value of this force is for a particular air-
plane.
Nature of the Problem
We know that the plane strikes the
ground with a certain velocity. The tire
and shock absorber act together as a
spring and damper which stop the fall.
The completely theoretical analysis would
involve non-linear terms and would only
yield a solution for a particular example.
If we solved the problem for enough
conditions varying only one factor at a
time, we could arrive at relationships that
would satisfy our need, but these results
would still have to be verified in some

laboratory, and offers a course in experi-

fashion. The completely experimental ap-
proach would require a great number of
models tested under many conditions.
This would be expensive and time-con-
suming, and we would probably end up
with the plane in production before we
had the relations that we started out to
get.
Experimental Mechanics Solution
Let us consider an approach which
combines both theory and experiment,

that is, experimental mechanics. We will
make a theoretical solution based on our
elementary theory keeping track of any
assumptions that we make, and try to
compensate for them. Then we will set
up an experiment and test our theory. If
we find a correlation, we have our solu-
tion. If we do not find a correlation,
either our theory or experiment was not
properly evaluated and our procedure
must be refined.

Since the first realization of the power
of atomic energy in August 1945 scien-
tists, engineers, and economists have
sought to put this energy to work in the
generation of what is called "atomic
power." The entire process of atomic
power generation, from discovery of the
fuel to conversion of the energy of this
fuel to a usable form, is recognized as a
complex and difficult problem. Both the
technical and economic feasibility of such
an undertaking must be considered as
well as the length of time required to
realize such power generation on a prac-
tical basis. The most effective means of
operating such a program, whether by
government or private industry, must
also be considered.
This article will not attempt to discuss
each problem in great detail, but will at-
tempt to give an overall idea of atomic
power generation. It will be, therefore,
somewhat general in its treatment of each
aspect of the problem.
ESSENTIALS OF THE ATOMIC PILE
To understand atomic power genera-
tion, one must have some background in
the fundamentals of atomic structure.
Events and discoveries leading to the
present status of atomic power develop-
ment should also be recognized.
To facilitate understanding of the back-
ground of this subject, a brief description
of a typical power-generating atomic pile
(an engine which converts atomic fuel
into heat) will be given.
The atomic fuel used at present may be
uranium, thorium, or plutonium. If
uranium is used, for example, the uranium
atoms break or explode into fragments
when bombarded by externally produced
and accelerated neutrons. At the same
time, these uranium atoms give off minute
particles of neutrons. These neutrons
collide with other uranium atoms to cause
these atoms to rupture in turn.
The uranium fuel is enclosed in tight
containers thin enough to permit passage
of neutrons, but thick enough to contain
the fragments of burst uranium atoms.
These fragments must be contained be-
cause of their high toxicity.
Surrounding the fuel and fuel con-
tainers is a material, called the moderator,
whose function is to slow down the neu-

James A. Burns
trons in flight so as to increase the prob-
ability of collision and resultant bursting,
or fission, of the uranium atom. High
quality graphite is often used as a modera-
tor.
Although it is not essential to the
operation of an atomic pile, a shield sur-
rounds the entire assembly. This shield
absorbs or reflects the harmful radiation
given off by the fuel.
The explosive rupture of the uranium
atoms, the stopping of the moving frag-
ments of exploded fuel by the container,
and the absorption of radiation by the
shield all produce energy in the form of
heat. To utilize this heat in the genera-
tion of power, usually electric power, is
the main problem of atomic power gener-
ation.
TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF ATOMIC
POWER DEVELOPMENT
Design Problems
The methods of transferring heat en-
ergy of the pile to electrical energy are of
foremost importance. One method should
be to pump a liquid or gas through the
pile to absorb the heat and then to pump
the hot liquid or gas through a kind of
steam boiler, which would generate steam
to be used to drive a steam turbine-genera-
tor to produce electricity. In other words
in an atomic power plant, the atomic pile
and some auxiliary equipment will merely
replace the fuel-fired steam boiler, and
from that point on the atomic plant will
be the same as one using coal or oil as
a fuel.
It is not practical to generate steam
within the pile itself, for two main rea-
sons. First, the steam leaving the pile
would be radioactive, and consequently
the turbine, condenser, and all piping
would need heavy shielding. Second,
fluctuations in the water level would dis-
turb the nuclear equilibrium within the
pile and introduce a very difficult control
problem.
The General Electric Company is de-
signing a power pile for the Atomic
Energy Commission which will use a low-
melting-point liquid metal as the primary
heat-transfer medium. This liquid metal
will be pumped through the pile to absorb
the heat generated and to carry it to a heat
exchanger. All this part of the equipment
will be very radioactive and must be
heavily shielded. In the heat exchanger,
water will pick up the.heat and produce
steam to supply a turbine. The steam
piping and turbine will need no shielding.
Although the method of energy transfer
seems to be realized, at least in one case,
there still exists the technical problem of
building a power-producing pile to oper-
ate at the high temperature necessary for
good efficiency.
Another technical problem of the de-
sign is that of safety. The active part
of the pile must be surrounded by a shield
to protect personnel from deadly radio-
activity. This shield must be thick and
heavy—the equivalent of five to ten feet
of concrete. Because of the size and
weight of this shield, the design is now
limited to land power plants and pos-
sibly naval-ship power plants. The
Atomic Energy Commission has an-
nounced that the design of two such ship-
board plants is now underway.
Control Problems
The heat output rate of a pile can be
controlled quite easily and simply. As
stated earlier, an atmosphere of neutrons
is necessary to keep the chain reaction
going. Certain elements, such as boron,
have a great affinity for neutrons, but
simply absorb them and do not release
any others. Thus there are added several
boron-coated steel rods which can be
moved into or out of the pile by remote
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


control. If the power output is too high,
for example, the rods are automatically
moved farther into the pile so that more
neutrons are absorbed by the rods. This
leaves fewer neutrons available for the
chain reaction and the power output drops.
Fuel and Material Problems
Uranium, the main atomic fuel, is a
fairly abundant element. However, com-
mercial deposits of ore—containing one
percent or more of uranium oxide—are
relatively rare. In addition, natural uran-
ium is not immediately useful in produc-
ing atomic energy. Only that variety or
isotopes known as Uranium-235 is natur-
ally fissionable; and this isotope occurs as
one part in 140 of natural uranium. The
major isotope, Uranium-238, which com-
prises most of the other 139 parts of any
given amount of uranium, may be con-
verted into plutonium, which is a fission-
able element, by absorbing one of the neu-
trons released by the Uranium-235 when
the latter explodes. The element thorium
may also be converted into this fissionable
state by the same method.
If the pile uses more than one of the
extra neutrons released by the bursting
uranium atom in producing new fuel,
such as plutonium, the pile is then called
a "breeder." If this "breeding" possi-
bility is realized, the pile can generate
power and still contain more fissionable
material than was present at first. In a
breeder operating on a 100-percent utiliz-
ation basis the fission of one ton of
uranium would yield the same heat energy
as the burning of three million tons of
coal.
Another problem which must be con-
sidered is the effect of radiation on ma-
terials used in the pile, especially at high
temperatures. This consideration should
eventually develop metals which will be
able to withstand the effects of radiation
and high temperatures. Studies of this
sort are proposed as part of the Michigan
Memorial Phoenix Project at the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF-ATOMIC
POWER DEVELOPMENT
Competitive Operation
In addition to the technical problems
of atomic power development, there are
very important economic problems which
must be considered. Perhaps the most im-
portant of these economic problems is the

Model of the Synchrotron under con-
struction in the Physics Department of
the University of Michigan which will
serve in atomic research.
relationship between the atomic power
industry and existing power industries
which produce power from fired-fuel or
water.
The cost of generating electricity with
nuclear fuel may be estimated at four
mills per kilowatt-hour (K.W.H.) as a
minimum, 10 mills as a maximum, and
6.5 to 7.5 mills "intermediate." The high-
est figure may be taken as applicable to
the first commercial plants; the interme-
diate, to those built five or ten years after
the earliest installations; the lowest figure
represents the optimum cost that can be
achieved with methods now imaginable,
and it will probably be attained, if at all,
only after many years of experience.
The three cost figures are derived from
two major classes of data. First, it is
known that a conventional coal-fueled
electric plant of the most modern design
with a capacity of 75,000 to 100,000 kilo-
watts operating at an average rate of 50
percent capacity can produce electricity at
a cost of four mills per K.W.H. (1946
prices). Taking into account the cost of
power-generating equipment which would
be common to both a conventional and an
atomic "electricity plant, and the fixed
charges and operating costs other than
fuel, it has been concluded that atomic
power at best would be the cost equiva-
lent of ordinary thermal power based on a
costless fuel.
Since one pound of nuclear fuel is the
equivalent of approximately 1,250 tons of
bituminous coal, for most practical pur-
poses fissionable material may be regarded
as weightless as well as costless fuel.
The initial fuel investment in an atomic
reactor will not be negligible, and it will
have to be written off in overhead charges.
Thereafter, however, it is expected that
the reactor can feed on natural uranium
and thorium. This, of course, is based on
the not unreasonable assumption that the
breeder technique is likely to prove suc-
cessful.
The foregoing data comes from the
study of the problem by the Cowles Com-
mission for Research in Economics. Other
previously published cost studies of the
problem such as the California and
Thomas reports furnished similar support-
ing data.
In arriving at cost figures for atomic
power in industry, one of the essentials
involved is what is known as the "plant
factor." Plant factor is the percentage of
capacity at which the power station oper-
ates. Since fixed charges are an important
element of atomic power costs, substantial
cost reductions per K.W.H. are possible
if capacity is more fully utilized. In many
industries where there is a heavy, contin-
uous energy demand, a higher plant factor
might easily bring atomic power within
competitive reach. For example, at 50
percent capacity the minimum estimated
cost of atomic power is 4 to 4.5 mills
per K.W.H.; at 80 percent capacity it is
2.7 to 3.2 mills, and at 90 percent capac-
ity it is 2.5 to 3 mills.
From these cost analyses it can then be
seen that atomic power can compete fav-
orably with coal even at a cost of 5 to 7
mills per K.W.H. only under various
circumstances and in various localities. At
selected points in several countries, in-
cluding Norway, Sweden, Yugoslavia,
Japan, Italy, Switzerland, the U. S., and
the U. S. S. R., hydroelectric power is gen-
erated at four mills per K.W.H. or less.
Atomic power is therefore not competitive
at those points. There are as many other
localities where atomic power at 4 to 6
mills per K. W. H. would be competi-
tive with water power.
Among the countries where atomic
power may turn out to be of the greatest
significance are Argentina and Brazil,
which have negligible fuel resources and
many important population centers far

An experiment in the automotive future
—a low, sleek sports car with dramatic,
sweeping lines of a pet aircraft—was un-
veiled recently by the Styling Section of
General Motors.
The car, a custom built two seater, is
under construction in Styling Section
shops and is expected to be completed
within two months. The first showing was
in the form of a full-size plaster model.
Harley J. Earl, GM Vice President in
Charge of Styling, said the new vehicle
will bear the symbolic name of Le Sabre.
In development four years, Le Sabre will
be a "laboratory on wheels" for testing
both mechanical and styling ideas that
GM designers have sketched on drawing
boards and discussed in engineering shop-
talk.
"This is the car of the future only in
the same sense that some of its design or
mechanical features may appear some day
in standard motorcars," Mr. Earl said.
'Le Sabre is purely experimental. Ac-
tually, it is the second car of its kind, the
advanced counterpart of an experimental
car we built 12 years ago for the same
reason—to find out whether some of our
futuristic ideas would pay off on the road,"
he explained.
The 1938 Model
Mr. Earl's 1938 experimental car was
equipped with a number of styling and
mechanical innovations considered ad-
vanced at that time. But they appeared,
sometimes in modified form, on later pro-
duction models.
It was the first American styled car on
public display with electrically controlled
convertible top and door windows,
curved glass door windows, pushbutton
door latches inside and out, a low vertical
front grille, fender extensions over the
doors and tail lamps recessed in the rear
fenders.
Details of the hood and fender treat-
ment also appeared in the design of sub-
sequent General Motors Production cars.
"We didn't know in 1938 what features
of our first experimental car would be
used—or abandoned—as we developed
our styling since that time," Mr. Earl de-
clared.
"By the same token, it is impossible to
say now what innovations we are testing
in Le Sabre may be used stylewise or me-

A profile view of Le Sabre tends to emphasize its height of only 36'/j inches
to the cowl, and 50 inches with the convertible top raised.
chanically in future production models,"
he said.
Materials used in Le Sabre, such as
magnesium and aluminum alloys, would
be untouchable from a cost standpoint in
current production models.
"However, if the time should come
when some materials or some devices in
this car get within range of the custo-
mer's pocketbook, we'll be ready," Mr.
Earl said. "That is the point of building
this car—to be prepared for the future."
The Power Plant
Le Sabre will be powered by an experi-
mental V-8 engine, designed by Buick en-
gineers, with 10-to-l compression ratio
plus supercharger. Its dual fuel system
will utilize current premium fuels and
methyl alcohol (methanol). Methyl al-
cohol will be injected into the combustion
chambers through the carbureor at a cer-
tain level of the speed range for extra
power boost.
The engine, still undergoing tests, is ex-
pected to develop more than 300 horse-
power with supercharger. Stroke and bore
will be 3}4 by 3!/4 inches. Piston dis-
placement will be 215 cubic inches.
Engine weight is expected to total 500
pounds. Horsepower to weight ratio as
yet undetermined, is expected to be re-
markably high in comparison with stand-
ard production vehicles.
A special Dynaflow torque converter is
housed near the rear of the stationary
driveshaft, just ahead of the differential.
The rear brakes also are located on either
side of the differential, rather than on the
wheels. Twin universal joints on the
axles complete the rear assembly.
The car's chassis, designed by Buick's
Chief Engineer Charles A. Chayne, is as
streamlined and futuristic as the styling
of the body covering it. Present day cost
of special materials and tooling, however,
would make the chassis impractical for
production car use at this time.
The body is only 36'/, inches high at
the cowl and 50 inches high with the
convertible top raised. Wheelbase is 115
inches and overall length is 200 inches.
Overall width at the front fenders is 76\/2
inches.
In spite of the low profile, the car's
ground clearance is 6 inches. Leg room
totals 46y2 inches and head room 35%
inches.
New Lighting System
The top section of the front grille is
part of the lighting system. When the
front lamps are turned on, the grille re-
volves out of sight and a pair of close set
headlights, fitted on the reverse side of
the grille, swings into place.
Beneath the headlight-grille assembly-
is the radiator air intake. An invertedY-
shape bar protects the aluminum radiator
core. Additional slotted air inlets range
along the sides of the main inlet. Two
other small air scoops are designed on the
underside of the front bumper.
The lighting system includes a pair of
running or parking lamps at the outer
extremities of the front fenders, just above
the flanking curve of the bumpers. These
outline the car's frontal width.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


at present is only a "laboratory
on wheels"

Mr. Harley J. Earl, General Motors Vice President in Charge of Styling, looks
over the newly created experimental car Le Sabre.
Two sets of three tail lamps are mount-
ed on the trailing edge of the rear fins,
outlining the car from behind. These
operate as tail lamps and directional sig-
nals, while below them at the base of the
fins are the backup lights.
The simulated jet-type tail cone houses
the stoplight, centered by a "spinner"
or bomb-shape hub that serves as a rear
bumper. Two smaller but similarly
shaped spinners are fitted into the split
front bumper design at either side of the
radiator grille.
Le Sabre's twin tail fins have the func-
tional purpose of housing aircraft type
20-gallon rubberized fuel cells, one for
gasoline and the other for methyl alcohol.
They are similar to fuel tanks in aircraft
wings.
The Instrument Panel
Although Le Sabre's instrument panel
appears as replete with indicators, dials,
meters and control knobs as a bomber
cockpit, Mr. Earl said their operation
would be simple even for a driver at the
steering wheel for the first time.
Both labels and illumination of the in-
strument clusters—one on the steering
post and the other in a center group be-
neath the crash roll—are clearly defined.
Various indicators are illuminated from
behind, while the center group of instru-
ments can be lighted by a fluorescent tube.
The indicators flash red warning sig-
nals, such as the fuel, oil and torque con-
verter gauges, to notify the driver when
the levels reach a certain low point or a
dangerous condition exists.
Le Sabre has the usual instrument panel
gauges and dials. In addition it has such
aircraft features as a tachometer, compass
and altimeter. Other indicators register
engine oil temperature and pressure and
the torque converter fluid level and tem-
perature.
Knob controls are illuminated by small
bulbs in plastic inserts in the handles.
They light whenever the ignition is turned
on.
Electrical pushbutton door releases
operate inside and out and windows are
lifted and lowered electrically. In the
event of battery failure, door releases func-
tion mechanically with an extra push on
the buttons or a turn of the car key.
Instrument panel controls operate hy-
draulic jacks on each of the car's wheels.
In the event of a blowout or flat tire, the
driver can jack up the car without leaving
his seat. An electrically driven screwjack,
controlled by a switch, is available to ad-
just the driver's seat.
In addition to a warm air circulating
system, the car is equipped with thermo-
statically controlled seat warmers. These
operate on the same principle as electri-
cally heated flying suits used by airmen.
Other New Features
As with Mr. Earl's earlier experimental
car, Le Sabre has an electrically operated
convertible top. Its construction differs
from the earlier version, however, in that
it has no visible linkage.
Also, it may be partially opened to ease
the way for driver and passenger to get
in or out of the seats. If the car is park-
ed with top down, rain falling on a sen-
sitized spot between the seats actuates the
top raising mechanism and raises the win-
dows automatically.
The rear view mirror differs from the
conventional type in design. It is built
into the center of the cowl above the in-

STEPHEN F. LUPE, '53IM
A thorough understanding of the sci-
ence of good air diffusion is a pre-
requisite for anyone seriously interested in
air conditioning or ventilation. Special-
ists in these fields know only too well
from sad and costly experience that air
distribution—the final comfort factor—
can make or break any ventilating or air
conditioning installation.
These men also know that when devices
for this purpose are properly selected, the
conditioned air is distributed in a manner
that meets the most exacting specifications
for climate control. Improper selection of
air diffusers invariably leads to severe
drafts, unequalized temperatures, poor hu-
midity control, air stratification, stale air
pockets, and other objectionable condi-
tions.
For cooling, temperature of air in the
duct must be sharply lowered so that the
incoming air will establish the desired
overall room temperature when mixed
with the warmer room air. These con-
trasting air temperatures present quite a
sizeable problem for the contractor.
When this cold, high-velocity air leaves
the small duct through an improperly se-
lected fixture, it usually sweeps to the

Stephen F. Lupe
occupancy level of the room before mix-
ing with warmer air, and before its ve-
locity is appreciably reduced by entrain-
ment of room air. Such unsatisfactory con-
ditions can be avoided only by reducing
incoming air velocity at duct openings.
Then the cooled incoming air and the

Air diffuser mounted in the ceiling is a combination unit which incorporates a
lighting fixture within its hub.
warmer room air can be mixed well above
occupancy level before the mixture is dis-
tributed in a controlled, draftless pattern.
This means far more than merely supply-
ing the required volume of properly con-
ditioned air.
Often an ordinary thermometer and a
psychometer for humidity measurements
will show that the system is faulty. By
taking readings at various points in the
room, from floor to ceiling, the engineer
will often find wide temperature dif-
ferentials. If both temperature and hu-
midity are unequalized to any extent, a
wide variance will undoubtedly be found
in air velocities throughout the condition-
ed enclosure. The engineer can convince
himself of this simply by noting how the
air movement affects a match flame, to-
bacco smoke or cotton fluff. An accurate
test can be made with a thermoanemome-
ter (thermometer anemometer) or a Kata-
thermometer may be used although the
latter is cumbersome and requires more
time to operate. Perhaps, the best instru-
ment to use is the Anemotherm Air
Meter, whose small probe at the end of a
long flexible cable permits measurement of
velocity, temperature and static pressure
on an instrument scale that is direct-
reading.
If the previously mentioned tests indi-
cate that air is being improperly distrib-
uted throughout the enclosure, the fault
can often be found right at the air duct
openings. In the shipping room of one
mid-western dairy plant, for example,
blasts of cold air from two unit coolers
were so severe that employees could not
endure room temperatures of 50F, even
though lower temperatures were essential
to proper operations of the plant.
When conventional horizontal grilles
on the unit coolers in the plant were re-
placed by scientifically designed air dif-
fusers, the unsatisfactory conditions were
immediately eliminated.
In another plant, the air conditioning
system failed to maintain the temperature
and humidity required for the manufac-
turing process. A study showed that the
trouble was entirely due to the air being
improperly distributed after leaving the
ducts. When efficient air diffusers were
used to replace existing outlets, tempera-
ture and humidity were closely main-

tained throughout the room. And, even
after air changes were substantial'y in-
creased for more efficient operating con-
ditions, all drafts were eliminated.
When cold air enters a room through
conventional outlets—grilles, registers or
perforated panels—it usually sweeps to
the floor and this forces the warmer room
air to the ceiling. Until the velocity of
the cold incoming air subsides, it cannot
mix with the warmer room air. This re-
sults in a room fi lied with drafts and tur-
bulent air; temperature differentials are
great throughout the room; humidity is
unequal ized and stagnant air pockets are
prevalent.
In the plants previously mentioned,
such unsatisfactory conditions were recti-
fied by installing "aspirating" air diffusers.
These devices (lower right) are com-
posed of a series of accurately shaped
metal cones assembled in definite relation
to each other. Air entering a room passes
through these cones and, because of their
unique design, is instantly reduced in
velocity within the device. Simultaneous-
ly, air from the room—up to about 35%
of the incoming air—is siphoned into the
diffuser where it is mixed with the incom-
ing air.
The pre-mixed air then leaves the dif-
fuser at a low velocity and spreads over a
pre-determined area well above the oc-
cupancy zone, and then finally reaches the
occupancy level of the room as a slow-
moving low-pressure blanket. Because the
primary air mixing action takes place
within this diffuser, and because all ma-
jor air turbulence is limited to its im-
mediate vicinity, no drafts are perceptible
to occupants of the room.
It might be said that the air mixture
spreads out into the room instead of
sweeping in, as it does when conventional
fixtures are used at duct openings. There-
fore, obstacles such as columns, machines
and furnishings do not deflect air-flow.
And stagnant air pockets—whether under-
cooled or overcooled—are eliminated as a
result of the thorough distribution of air
in every part of the room. The overall re-
sult is even, draftless air distribution that
causes both temperature and humidity to
be closely equalized throughout the room.
However, before air can be distributed
in this controlled pattern, various factors
must be considered. Here are some of the
points that must be given attention: the
use of the room, minimum and maximum
number of occupants, the area of the
room, height of ceiling, design of ceiling,
location of duct openings, duct sizes, duct
velocities, permissible sound levels, loca-
tions of columns and other obstructions,
the location, type and heat-load of light-
ing fixtures, location of exhaust outlets,
unusual concentrations of internal heat,
solar radiation and other items.
How, then, are engineers to know what
type of diffuser to specify for a particular
job? Naturally, specialists are available
but for preliminary planning it is possible
to make some rough calculations. Sup-
pose, for example, that a small depart-
ment store is to be air conditioned—it
measures 60 x 120 ft. and has a 20 ft.
ceiling
Next, the plan is divided into two 60
ft. squares and a diffuser is centered in
each square. Now, the total air supply in
cubic feet per minute must be determined.
The formula: Volume of the room, times
air changes per hour, divided by 60. For
this illustration, assume that a little better
than 4 air changes per hour are required.
Then, 10,000 cfm are required for the
entire room. One diffuser will then
handle half the volume or 5,000 cfm.
The engineer must next know the
proper neck velocity for the Type B Dif-
fuser in a department store with a 20 ft.
ceiling. Referring to Fig. 2 and applying
curve E, the maximum permissible neck
velocity is found to be 1750 fpm. Turn-

Metal conical segments of this "aspirating" air diffuser are designed so that the
passage of incoming air (black arrows) through them siphons a series of counter
currents of room air (white arrows) back into the diffuser.

I HE aeros proved there's more than one way to spend club money when
the UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN chapter of the Institute of the Aeronautical
Sciences held its annual banquet at the Flight Deck, Willow Run Airport.
Guest speaker was Colonel Frank Seiler, Chief of Air Research, Air Mate-
rial Command, U. S. Air Force, who addressed the group on computing ma-
chines. The feast consisted of a turkey dinner served airlines style.
After the banquet, the club members and their wives and/or sweethearts
adjourned to dance in the Flight Room overlooking the runways. Jim Servis
and his orchestra provided the acoustics.
We have to hand it to the aeronautical engineers for doing it up right. If
this is to start a precedent, we can see the Civils holding their next banquet in

Range, Power and Versatility of Light
Microscope Extended by New
Television Technique
Significant extension of the range,
power and versatility of the light micro-
scope by use of special electronic eyes of
the television camera, instead of the hu-
man eye, was demonstrated by scientists
of Princeton University and the RCA
Laboratories Division.
The new technique of televised micro-
scopy, since it enables the interchanging
of television camera tubes made sensitive
to specific wave lengths of light, gives
considerably sharper contrast than here-
tofore available, according to Dr. A. K.
Parpart, chairman of the Princeton De-
partment of Biology. Dr. Parpart has
tested the experimental RCA industrial
television equipment in biological research
since last April.
The television-microscope combination,
Dr. Parpart said, also has the advantages
of making possible (1) the study of many
components of living cells normally vis-
ible only after killing and staining and
(2) the direct observation of motion of,
and within, these cells at high magnifica-
tions. Even without the specially sensi-
tized tubes a high degree of contrast en-
hancement can be obtained by means of
the variable light level controls on the
television receiver screen.
Though the RCA televised microscopy
equipment has been used primarily for re-
search at Princeton, Dr. Parpart said that
it had proved convenient for showing
specimens to several persons simultaneous-
ly in a conference group. It has also been
used successfully in large classroom dem-
onstrations by Dr. Harry Fulbright, former
Princeton physics professor, in two other-
wise difficult microscopic demonstrations
—the Millikan oil drop experiment and
the demonstration of Brownian motion in
smoke particles.
The experimental installation consists
of a laboratory microscope mounted be-
neath an RCA industrial television camera,
which is no larger than a personal 16-
mm motion picture camera. The televised
microscopic scene is transmitted by cable
to a standard receiver-monitor placed
nearby.
At the heart of the industrial television
camera is a remarkably small and sensitive
pickup tube—the Vidicon. For micro-
scopy, the Vidicon can be sensitized with
materials which make it receptive to a
particular narrow band of wave lengths.
For the model used by Dr. Parpart, a red-
sensitive tube and a violet-sensitive tube

The newly developed television microscope finds extensive
use in the research laboratories.
have been provided. RCA research engi-
neers are developing tubes which may ex-
tend the range of the microscope's vision
into the infra-red and ultra-violet regions.
The microscope can also be equipped with
a minocular viewer and a second television
camera so that two selective tubes scan the
microscopic scene at the same time.
With the red or violet tube, Dr. Parpart
explained, it is possible to select a narrow
wave length band for study of a particular
cellular material whose light absorption
characteristics lie in that band. The de-
gree of contrast between various chemical
components within the cell, he said, is
much superior to that previously gained
by the tedious method of photographing
the specimen through color filters. In
fact, he added, some granules in living
cells have been brought out this way for
the first time.
Many biological specimens, such as
granules of certain red blood cells, can
at present be studied only after they have
been stained, he said. With televised
microscopy, the appropriate tube will
make the specimen stand out clearly with-
out staining, he said, explaining that
staining often either kills a specimen or,
in some instances, a specimen must be
killed before it will absorb the stain.
Dr. Parpart pointed out that the new
technique enabled examination of either
slow or rapid motion of material under a
microscope at magnifications which form-
erly could have been "watched" only by
motion picture photography. This method
offered no effective way of monitoring
what the camera was shooting and requir-
ed such an intense light source that living
material was either killed or injured, he
said. With the low light levels needed
for televising the microscopic scene, living
material can be examined for many hours
without damage.
Mr. Flory said that enlargement of the
image up to 15 to 20 times through the
television system made for ease of viewing
and made the equipment particularly
adaptable for classroom or conference use.
Even larger enlargements are feasible by
projection of the image onto a screen, he
said.
Science is wonderful: It couldn't open
a day coach window so it invented air
conditioning.

from potential water power; Denmark
and the North African group of coun-
tries, which have negligible fuel
Effect on Other Industries
Any major effects atomic power might
have upon other energy-consuming in-
dustries is also worth consideration. These
effects would probably entail the follow-
ing three considerations: first, cost reduc-
tions due to the use of atomic power;
second, process changes due to low-cost
atomic power in which methods based on
atomic energy would substitute for the
direct fuel-burning or chemical methods
used today, and third, changes in the loca-
tion of certain manufacturing activities as
a result of geographical equalization of
power costs.
The aforementioned Cowles Report
considers the effects of atomic power on
certain industries in whose manufacturing
processes the cost of energy is a sub-
stantial percentage of the total cost of
production These industries included
aluminum, chlorine, phosphate, cement,
iron and steel, railroads, and residential
heating.
This study suggests that atomic power
may be of great importance in expanding
and relocating the production of alum-
inum, now concentrated near water power.
It is also possible that nuclear-powered
hydrogen-reduction furnaces located near
major iron-ore regions would permit deliv-
ery of iron to existing iron markets at a
lower cost than iron from the coke blast
furnaces of the steel plants in those cen-
ters. This might bring about decentraliza-
tion of the steel industry. The same proc-
ess might increase the steel production of
such places as Great Britain, India, or
Brazil, since these countries have limited
coking-coal resources but large iron ore
deposits.
Effect on National Economy
It is difficult to determine just what
effect, if any, the introduction of cheap
atomic power would have upon the econ-
omy of the nation as a whole. It has been
suggested, from a theoretical basis only,
that atomic power might increase the na-
tional income by one percent or less. As
pointed out in the Cowles Report,
"Atomic power may at most accelerate
some processes, [but it may be] over-
shadowed by such factors as the rate of
capital formation in slightly industrialized
areas, population changes, the rate of
(Continued from page 17)
spread of technological knowledge and
skills, and government policies in relation
to industry and international trade."
TIME REQUIREMENTS AND
GOVERNMENT CONTROL
Technological Time Requirements
Many technical problems in the pro-
duction of atomic power on a practical
scale remain to be overcome. Experi-
mental reactors are now being built and

The Electron Microscope is also a great
aid in atomic energy pioneering.
tested, and additional reactors must then
be designed to test the knowledge gained
from the first group. The cost of purify-
ing atomic fuels alone may decide the fate
of atomic power as an economic good. In
general, prophecies by Atomic Energy
Commission officials and other competent
scientists as to when the solution of these
problems will be achieved suggest 20 years
as a minimum, with any time up to 50
years as a probability.
Government Control
Whether or not the government retains
its present monopoly in the atomic energy
field or turns the work over to private
industry may have some effect on the time
required to realize atomic power develop-
ment on a practical scale. David Lilien-
thal, former chairman of the Atomic
Energy Commission, proposes that we
develop the atom as we normally would
any industrial knowledge: through private-
industry and competition. Charles
Thomas, president of the Monsanto
Chemical Company, suggests that private
concerns as well as the government be al-
lowed to build power-breeder reactors.
Another important factor seems to be
the fact that as long as atomic bombs are
so important a military device, the gov-
ernment will be reluctant to allow plu-
tonium to be fed back to the breeder re-
actors. Rather, they will require all fis-
sionable products to be used in the pro-
duction of bombs. Since, of course, the
economical operation of the breeder de-
pends upon re-use of these products, as
long as it is necessary to produce atomic
bombs, atomic power generation on a
practical basis will not be realized. On the
other hand, if there were international
control of atomic energy, it would seem
that more atomic resources could be de-
voted to atomic power generation. Thus,
the length of time before economical
atomic power will be enjoyed depends
also on social and political factors as well.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In a general consideration of the pros-
pect of power generation from atomic
sources it is realized that there are two
main divisions of the problem—technical
and economic.
Solution of the technical problems, that
is, those of design, control, and fuel and
materials, seems to be more complete than
solution of the economic problems.
Methods of power transfer have been
studied and at least one reasonable solu-
tion offered.
The problem of safety seems to have
been satisfactorily solved, although in
stationary plants only. Increased efficiency
will undoubtedly come with further de-
velopment of the design.
A study of the economic problems in-
dicates that because there is no great re-
duction in the cost to the consumer of
power developed from atomic energy,
atomic power will probably be used only
as a supplement to existing methods of
power generation. On the other hand,
atomic power plants may be set up in
locations not suitable as sites for fired-
fuel or hydroelectric plants.
Further study of the economic aspects
of atomic power indicate that this form
of power development will have a marked
effect on many manufacturing industries
which use a great deal of energy.
Finally, the influence of the government
in directing the production of atomic
energy affects the prospect of atomic
power.

While the solution proceeded, 12 re-

and how to make changes for better re-

Solution of the problem involved 250
additions, 67 multiplications, 30 integra-
tions, and 20 aerodynamic functions, all
carried on simultaneously with continu-
ously variable factors. A mathematician
and an assistant would require 6 months
to compute a single solution for the
minimum number of points required to
give an approximate answer. Typhoon
gave the continuous solution, for an in-
Typhoon Is Versatile
It was pointed out by Mr. Vance that
Typhoon is an extremely versatile in-
strument. Shortly before the start of the
demonstration a complex problem was be-
ing solved by the computer. A few hours
later, all necessary adjustments had been
completed in order to determine the solu-
tion for the test problem. On equally
short notice, Typhoon may be switched
from one problem to another. This fea-
ture is a valuable aid to design engineers
who require speedy verification of plans
before going ahead with construction
work.
The heart of Typhoon is a new type
of electronic multiplier which consists of
a hybrid between analogue and digital
apparatus. Basically, an analogue device
may be compared to the operation of a
slide rule, and a digital one is similar in
function to an adding machine. By blend-
ing these two techniques in more complex
forms, Typhoon achieves a combination
of flexibility and accuracy unobtainable
by either of the systems alone. Each of
the more than 600 electronic relays in the
computer's multipliers can operate in
1/10,000 of a second.
A staff of nine engineers and mathema-
ticians as well as six technical assistants
are required to operate the computer
when it is solving complex guided missile
problems. To keep the sensitive instru-
ment free of climatic influences, Typhoon
is housed in a special air-conditioned room
at RCA Laboratories which has a constant
temperature of 75° Fahrenheit and a rela-
tive humidity of not more than 50 per
cent.

A touch of gold. •.
a lot of Engineering!
This is the grid frame for an electron tube
that plays a vital part in the Bell System's radio
relay network for long distance telephone calls
and television programs.
Across the central hole of a frame —between
dotted lines —tungsten wires .0003 of an inch in
diameter, so fine you can barely see them, must
be placed with their centers .001 of an inch apart.
How to fasten this wire securely to a frame posed
a problem that took the combined skills of many
kinds of engineers.
Electrical, Chemical and Metallurgical
Engineers decided it could best be anchored with
gold. Why gold? Because it is inert in a vacuum,
reduces grid emission, is suitable for the working
temperature of the tube and is a good electrical
conductor.
Physicists, Electrical and Mechanical Engi-
neers tackled this problem — and adapted the
machine shown, in which frames are placed—forty
at a time—on a two-level rack. Between the up-
rights of the rack are heating coils into which
short lengths of 24 karat gold wire are placed.
An air-tight cover is lowered, the chamber evacu-
ated and heaters are switched on. When vacuum
and temperature are just right, the operator
passes a carefully controlled current through the
coils and the gold vaporizes, covering the grid
frames with a coating .00002 of an inch thick.
Only about two and one-half cents worth of gold
per frame is used.
Tungsten wire is next wound around two
frames at a time. These are put into a hydrogen
atmosphere and heated until the gold melts and
brazes the wire firmly to both frames, which are
then split apart.
Industrial Engineers made thorough job cost
and time studies which show this new process is
fast and economical.
Working closely together, Western Electric
engineers of varied skills are constantly develop-
ing new, better and more economical ways to
make telephone equipment. That's how they help
the Bell System give this country the best tele-
phone service on earth at the lowest possible cost.

This unusual machine turns gold into vapor to gold-
plate little grid frames at Western Electric.

arms for the tire, accelerometer and ver-
tical measurements. The curve 1 shows
the tire force P plotted against deflection
dH measured at the pointer. We notice
that this is a non-linear curve. The force
increases slowly near zero which leads us
to a linearizing assumption that there is

still free fall over this initial section and
the contact is made after a deflection dK„.
The spring constant K for the tire will
then be a constant determined by the slope
of the dotted line. It might be well to add
that this assumption should make the
theoretical peak force slightly high.

made during the test procedure.
Next we must find the velocity at the
end of the free fall. This is done by
equating the kinetic energy at the end of
the free fall to the work done:
w = rotational velocity.

where the hK = hn -f- dK„, that is, the
actual free fall plus the assumed inactive
deflection of the tire.
Using the conservation of energy again
we can find the peak for Pn. We do this
by first finding the maximum deflection of
the tire d„, = d and then multiplying it
by the spring constant k. The potential
energy at the point of contact is Psd; the

We squeezed first... and
Now IT'S YOUR TURN. Pick up one of those new pliant, un-
breakable plastic bottles. Squeeze it. Feel how it gives under
your hand, then see how it comes right back for more.
That's polyethylene (just say polly-ethel-een), one
of the exciting new miracle plastics produced by the people
of Union Carbide.
But before you squeezed it, they squeezed ethylene gas
under terrific pressure and carefully controlled conditions.
Result: the molecules of gas were permanently rearranged
into long lines—one of the marvels of modern chemistry.
And then out came this tough, flexible plastic utterly unlike
any other material —natural or man-made.
Why do you find the people of Union Carbide leading in
the development of polyethylene?
Because working with tremendous pressures, high vac-
uum and extremes of heat and cold is part of their everyday
jobs. By the use and control of these forces they supply the
world with a wide variety of plastics and the raw materials
from which a multitude of synthetic fibres are made. They
also make hundreds of other basic materials essential to
modern science and industry.
Perhaps your business could profit by the use of some of
these materials. Whv not ask us about them?

Basic research at RCA Laboratories has led to most of today's all-electronic television advances.
/fritfe 6e#rf of every-^erisfon sef/
Why show RCA Laboratories inside
your television receiver? Because al-
most every advance in all-electronic
TV was pioneered by the scientists
and research men of this institution.
The image orthicon television camera
was brought to present perfection at RCA
Laboratories. The kinescope, in these
laboratories, became the mass-produced
electron tube on the face of which you see
television pictures. New sound systems,
microphones—even the phosphors which
light your TV screen —first reached prac-
tical perfection here.
Most important of all, the great bulk of
these advances have been made available to
the television industry. If you've ever seen a
television picture, you've seen RCA Labora-
tories at work.

ing now to Fig. 3, the capacity table,
under 1700 fpm neck velocity, the capacity
in cfm is found to be 5340 for the size
No. 60 Type B Diffuser. Further exam-
ination of the table in Fig. 3 shows that
the same diffuser handles air at 5030 cfm
with a neck velocity of 1600 fpm and
4710 cfm with a neck velocity of 1500
lems. Therefore, different designs are
used for different conditions. For ex-

fpm. By interpolation, 5000 cfm will be
delivered at approximately 1590 fpm neck
velocity.
A final check must be made by con-
sulting Fig 3 where are listed the recom-
mended limits for radius of diffusion. The
table shows 22 to 45 ft.—actual radius of
each 60 ft. square is 30 ft to the wall and
42.3 ft. to the corners—therefore, the No.
60 unit will be satisfactory for this in-
stallation.
Naturally, it is not always possible to
divide the plan into squares—or to center
the diffusers in the divisions—as in this
example. Therefore, rectangles are per-
missible if the longer sides do not exceed
the shorter by more than 3/2. If a diffuser
cannot be placed in the center of an area,
the longer perpendicular distance from a
side should not exceed the shorter by more
than 3/2.
Because of the various factors involved,
one single design of diffuser could not be
expected to solve all air distribution prob-
in occupancy zones do not exceed 40 fpm.
—an air motion of less than one-half mile
per hour.
Since these "aspirating" air diffusers
circulate air of the highest duct velocities
in a draftless pattern, they make it pos-
sible to install smaller ducts to handle
larger volumes of air than is customary.
Duct layouts also may be simplified be-
cause the unit thoroughly distribute the
air in spite of columns, machines and
other obstacles. Small ducts and simpli-
fied layouts permit a saving in space and
in instalation cost.
If this article has convinced the reader
that careful selection of air diffusers is of
prime importance to any air conditioning
system—then, it has served its purpose.
Air distribution does not end at the duct
opening. Here, in fact, is where scientific
air distribution begins—the factor which,
more than anything else, can result in suc-
cess or failure of even the most expensive
installation.

If a belt could do it better...
Grinding a crankshaft calls for a
grinding wheel of definite specifica-
tions. But, if it could be done better,
faster or more economically.. .with
an abrasive belt, for instance ...
carborundum would be free to rec-
ommend the right belt impartially.
This is because only carborundum
manufactures a complete line of abra-
sives—and only carborundum can
make impartial recommendation of
the right abrasive to use in every
grinding or cutting operation.
In addition to abrasives, many
other products of equal importance
industrially are identified by the
carborundum brand. Refractories
are among the more important. So
closely associated with outstanding
characteristics and properties are
these products, that "Super" has
been added as a prefix to segregate
them from the ordinary. In the fields
of heat treatment and ceramics,
globar non-metallic heating ele-
ments are used increasingly while
ceramic resistors find application in
an expanding list of electronic de-
velopments. The Canadian market

PROBLEM — You are designing a diathermy unit. Included
In the electrical circuit are variable elements which must be
adjusted during operation. The control knobs must be
located where they will be convenient to the operator. The
variable elements themselves must be located in the cabinet
where they will be easy to mount, to wire and to service.
How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER — Use an S.S.White remote control
type flexible shaft to couple each variable element to its
control knob. This simple arrangement makes it possible
to place the elements and their controls anywhere you want
them. And you will find, too, that operation with these
shafts Is as smooth and sensitive as a direct connection,
because S.S.White remote control flexible shafts are de-
signed and built especially for this type of duty.
This is just one of hundreds
of remote control and
power drive problems to
which S.S.White flexible
shafts provide a simple
answer. That's why every
engineer should be famil-
iar with the range and

change with temperature is relatively small, and these alloys
find wide use. In measuring temperature it is necessary to
make use of wire whose resistance has a relatively larger
change with temperature. A wire loop is then constructed and
used as one arm of a Wheatstone bridge. The loop is
bonded to the part whose temperature is to be measured. An
identical loop is placed on a specimen of the same material
at room temperature. The scale on the variable resistance of
the Wheatstone bridge is then calibrated to read the dif-
ference in temperature between the part and room terpera-
ture directly.
Changes of pressure inside a thin cylindrical drum can
be measured if a strain gage is placed circumferentially on
the drum. The strain is directly proportional to pressure.
Changes of pressure can be computed easily from changes in
strain.
It may not be possible to transform a desired measurement
into a change of electrical resistance, but it may be possible
to make the transformation into some other basic electrical
quantity such as capacitance or inductance. Then the prob-
lem of obtaining a precision measurement is just about as
easy as with the Wheatstone bridge. It is now necessary
to resort to the alternating current (A-C) bridge.
Understanding the A-C bridge requires a greater knowl-
edge of the basic principles of electricity than was neces-
sary in the case of the Wheatstone bridge. For work with
the A-C bridge a firm grasp of such concepts as capacitance,
inductance, capacitative reactance, inductive reactance, im-

What's it for?
This 10-ton
abrasive wheel
helps produce
which of the
following?
□ Steel
U Paper
□ Cement
□ Coal
The answer is paper and the wheel is a
Norton pulpstone, used in the grinding of
wood pulp.
How It's Made
In the Norton pulpstone, abrasive seg-
ments are anchored securely to a rein-
forced concrete center, and staggered to
comprise a continuous grinding surface.
Depending on pulp requirements, the
abrasive mediums are Crystolon* silicon
carbide or Alundum* aluminum oxide,
both trade-marked Norton products noted
for their great hardness, sharpness and
high resistance to wear. Joints between
segments are made of a special material
which is unaffected by continuous immer-
sion in hot water and has a wear-resistance
approximating that of the abrasive.
Advantages
Thanks to their scientific construction,
and to the constant care that controls
their manufacture, Norton pulpstones
are, above all, quality producers. In addi-
tion, their extremely low wearing rates
enable mills to obtain a higher yield of
pulp per cord of wood and to reduce
expensive, production-halting shutdowns
due to stone replacements. That is why
Norton pulpstones are preferred by wood
pulp mills the world over.

The A-C bridge (Fig. 4) appears simi-

any combination of these three whatso-
ever. The nomenclature is chosen, how-
ever, to obtain ease of balance and rela-
tively simple computation, so that the
arms of practical bridges remain fairly
simple. The battery of the Wheatstone
bridge is replaced by a source of alternat-
ing current such as a vacuum tube oscilla-
tor or the local power line. The detector
may consist of an amplifier and cathode
ray oscilloscope or an ordinary telephone
headset.
The relationship at balance among the
arms in the A-C bridge is determined in
the same way as was the relationship in
the Wheatstone bridge. From equation
four we have,
Z4Z2 = Z1Z3 (5)
or in words, that the product of impe-
dances of one pair of opposite arms must
equal the product of impedances of the
other pair of opposite arms.
Impedance
Impedance is quite different from re-
sistance. It consists not only of a magni-
tude (P) but also of a phase angle (0),
and may be written in the following way:
Z = Pe'9 = P(cos0 -f jsin©) = R + jX
where R is the reactive component and X
the reactive component of the impedance
Z. A pure resistor (X = 0) has an im-
pedance of magnitude R and phase angle
zero. A pure inductance (R = 0) has an
inductive reactance X = wL, where
w = 2nf, f is frequency, and L is the
value of the inductance. The impedance
of the inductance at a frequency f has a
magnitude P = wL and a phase angle
(-) = 90°. A pure condenser (R = 0)
has a capacitative reactance X = l/(wC),
where C is the value of the capacitance.
The impedance of the condenser at a fre-
quency f has a magnitude P = l/(wC)
and a phase angle 0 = —90°.
Now we are able to examine series and
parallel combinations of resistance, induc-
tance and capacitance such as may occur in
an A-C bridge arm. Suppose an arm con-
sisted of a resistance R in series with an
inductance L. The impedance of the arm
is the vector sum of the two parts or
Z = R -|- jwL. Conversion to the polar
form would be accomplished by setting
P = (R2 -)_ w2L2)'-- and 0 = arctan
(wL/R).
Were the arm to consist of a resistance

necessary to remember that the total im-

individual impedances divided by their
sum. This can be accomplished in the
polar or rectangular form. The polar
form is more advantageous here because it
illustrates an idea in the following para-

expressions that have been obtained look
very complicated. However, they are
much less complicated than they look,
and turn out to be simple with just a little
understanding.

From the previous paragraph we see
that not only the magnitudes must bear
the relationship
P&lt;P2 = P,P,
but that the phase angles of the bridge-
arms must be of such value that
©4 + ©2 = ®i + ©3
Since these two conditions for balance
exist, it is necessary to use two variable
components in the bridge to obtain a
measurement by the balance method. It
will be the exception when these two
controls are independent in securing a
balance.
A Capacitance Comparison Bridge
Let us look at one of the many practical
A-C bridges. Shown in Fig. 3 is the Capa-
citance Comparison bridge. The resis-
tances shown in the capacitances arms are
not, in general, separate resistance units,
but represent resistance inherent in the
condensers. We have that
Z1 = R1-j(l/wCI) ;Z2 = R2
Z:i-R:, ; Z,=R. -j(l/wCx)
where C, and R, are the unknown quan-
tities. Substituting these values in equa-

A gun barrel made of glass...
This scientist is putting together the barrel
of an "electron gun." When completed, it
will be capable of developing cancer-killing
rays at twice the power of those given off by
all the medical radium in the world.
The barrel of the gun, part of a new super-
voltage X-ray machine used in cancer research
and treatment, is a tube formed by stacking
precision-made rings of one of Coming's
special electrical glasses.
Two million volts drive electrons through
the tube, much as a bullet is driven through
a gun barrel. As these electrons are suddenly
stopped by a water-cooled block of gold at
the end of the barrel, two-million-volt X-rays
are generated. This X-ray beam is powerful
enough to reach diseased areas four inches
inside the body and it can be directed with
great accuracy on the spot the doctor wants
to bombard.
High Voltage Engineering Corporation,
manufacturers of this generator, at first had
difficulty finding a high-voltage electrical in-
sulating material for the gun barrel, a mate-
rial that would stand electron bombardment
hour after hour without breaking down. The
answer to their problem was a glass selected
from the many developed by Corning to meet
exacting electrical specifications.
Providing glass for medical research is not
new to Corning. Since the early days of
X-rays, glass by Corning has played a vital
part in the development of X-ray apparatus
—transmitting glasses for tubes and absorb-
ing glasses for shields. And Pyrex brand lab-
oratory and pharmaceutical glassware has
served medical science since World War I.
Throughout industry, Corning means re-
search inglass—research that has contributed
in countless ways to better products and
processes, and through them, to better living
for us all.
That's why we suggest—when you're out of
college and concerned with improving prod-
ucts or processes—that you consider glass, a
material of practically limitless uses. And
should you want to know more about
Corning electrical glasses, or the hundreds of
other glasses Corning makes, we hope you'll
write us before your planning reaches the
blueprint stage. Corning Glass Works,

Thus the following expressions for the un-
knowns are obtained,
R, = R:JR1/R2
Cx = C1R2/R.^
Note that we have chosen R, and R3 to be
our variable parts. R, appears in only one
equation making the balance procedure
much easier than if it were to be in both
equations as is R:i. Were we to use C, as a
variable part instead of R3, the balance
controls would be completely independent.
It should be obvious that at least one of
the variable parts be in each of the
balance equations in order that physical
balance be possible.
Moisture Content Measurement
One type of A-C bridge has been
used in the textile industry to measure
the moisture content of cloth emerging
from a textile dryer. This instrument
replaces the sense of touch method, and
the manufacturer, Fielden Electronics
Company, claims that increases in produc-
tion of twenty-five percent have been re-
alized in the drying process.
ELECTRICAL BRIDGES
(Continued from page 40)
In this instrument the cloth emerging
from the dryer passes between the plates
of a large condenser, which forms one
arm of a A-C bridge. The cloth is the
dielectric for the condenser. Since the
specific capacitance of water is high as
compared to the cellulose and animal
fibers, an increase in the moisture con-
tent of the cloth means an increase in the
capacitance of the condenser, which can
readily be detected by an A-C bridge.
Because two balance controls are necessary
for an A-C bridge, and because this in-
strument would require the services of an
operator to secure a balance, the reading
is obtained in a different manner from
that explained for A-C bridges previously.
In this instrument the other arms contain
fixed members, and the magnitude of the
unbalance voltage is used as an indication
of moisture content.
Due to the small values of capacitance
in this bridge, a modulated radio fre-
quency oscillator is used. The unbalance
voltage is amplified, detected, and further
amplified before being applied to meter
with a scale calibrated in moisture con-
tent. The output may also be coupled to
an automatic control unit, which in turn
controls the speed-changing mechanism
of the drying machine.
Liquid Volume Measurement
A similar arrangement may be used to
measure the amount of fuel or some other
liquid in a tank, with the reading trans-
fered to a remote place. Were the tank
to be a vertical cylinder, the roof would
be insulated from the sides and would
form one plate of a condenser. The rest
of the metal tank would form the other
plate of the condenser. Since the dielec-
tric constant of the liquid will differ from
that of air or the vapor of the liquid, the
capacitance of the condenser will be a
function of the fluid level in the tank.
By making this condenser one arm of an
A-C bridge the same arrangement can be
used as in the previous example of meas-
uring moisture content. The meter or re-
cording device can be calibrated to read
in any desired units. The unbalance volt-
age may be amplified sufficiently to allow
the recording to be very remote from the
bridge.

EDITORIAL
No Change is Needed in the Engineering
Curricula
A frequent criticism of engineering colleges is that they are glorified trade schools,
providing little or no cultural background. These critics offer two solutions: either to
expand the engineering curricula to five or six years and add many cultural courses,
or to replace some of the present technical courses with liberal ones.
Their description of engineering colleges is slightly warped and their solutions
invalided. One question must be answered before the problem can be assumed to
exist—should the engineering curricula provide a broad cultural background? What
are its advantages?
A liberal education helps one gain a rich, full life, and aids one in getting along
with others. A liberal education is to be desired, and obtained if at all possible. But
desirability alone cannot be proclaimed as a reason for a course of action just as one
would not justify the life of a vagabond because a permanent vacation and constant
leisure is desirable. The merits of a liberal education are not sufficient reasons alone
for changing the engineering curricula.
The cost as well as the merits of a liberal education must be considered. Students
from prosperous families may be omitted in this discussion for they have the means
of obtaining any degree and kind of education they desire. But four years of college
for the average student means many years of financial burden on the student himself
or his family. The direct cost of education is high and the loss of wages, were the
student to be employed instead, is large. Even students attending college under the
G.I. Bill want to derive the most possible benefit from the limited time available
to them. The cost of a college education certainly lowers the standard of living of
the average family some degree. Let us examine a change in the engineering curricula
with this in mind.
An exchange of some liberal arts courses for some technical courses in the engineer-
ing curricula would impair slightly the immediate earning ability of the student.
Obviously a complete exchange of a liberal education for an engineering education
would leave the student unprepared for engineering work. No doubt a slight change
might go unnoticed.
Were the curricula to be extended to encompass more cultural training the imme-
diate financial burden would be accentuated. The value of a liberal education might
be worth this added hardship, but let us postpone a decision.
Still another factor must be considered, one which many critics overlook. A college
or university is not the only medium of obtaining a broad cultural background. A
man may obtain a liberal education on his own, through literature, lectures, concerts
and the like just as a man may become prominent in engineering by ascending the
ladder of industrial fame from the ranks of industry, without the advantage of
formal engineering training. This is the longer, harder journey. A college education
would have aided both men.
The average engineering student has already chosen his path to proficiency in
engineering. His present concentration upon engineering is an investment; and he
anticipates a large return. To him an engineering education is just as, or more desir-
able than a liberal education. He considers a liberal education to be a luxury education.
He considers a liberal education to be a luxury—it would be wonderful if he could
afford it now, but, alas his main interest must be in making a living.
In later life, leisure time provides an opportunity for enjoying literature, music
and concerts which will add continuously to his cultural background. Even while in
engineering college, these opportunities are available to him. Then, too, an engi-
neering education in itself adds to the cultural background of the student for he is
gaining knowledge of the sciences. The environment and spirit of college life is
still another factor.
There is no need to change the engineering curricula. It is well designed to suit
its purpose as long as the space reserved in it for cultural subjects is well used. If
the student leaves college well prepared for engineering work, and with a desire to
expand his cultural background, then the curricula has been well formed and well
executed.

Westinghouse accepts a responsibility to the
top-notch men it employs for engineering,
manufacturing, research and sales jobs.
Here are the ways Westinghouse helps.
Through a comprehensive orientation and
training program, we give our new men a
panoramic view of the electrical manufacturing
industry ... a broad knowledge of the products
of Westinghouse, an appreciation of the re-
search, engineering and manufacturing that
go into those products, and an understand-
ing of the marketing that gets them to the
ultimate user. Hundreds of experienced pro-
fessional people help carry out this program
. . . through planned conferences and actual
work assignments. In this way, new men get
a running start in their new work.
To help speed them along their way, a
Graduate Study Program is also made avail-
able through which advanced degrees may be
obtained. This program has been worked out
with a number of leading universities in major
Westinghouse locations.
Headquarters for these activities is the new
Educational Center, where a sizable staff de-
votes its entire attention to developing future
leaders for the company. With this new facility,
and the impetus that years of building for the
future has given, we look forward with con-
fidence to the years ahead. g-ioiis

The automotive and internal combustion laboratory has facilities for the testing of aero-
nautical, automotive, small locomotive, marine, and stationary tractor and truck engines.
These facilities include dynamometers in a wide range of capacities, water and fan brakes
and several engine test stands. A chassis dynamometer is available which will take a complete
motor vehicle.
There are several test engines of both Otto cycle and Diesel types in which the compres-
sion ratio, valve timing and valve lift, are variable, and in which the temperature of the cyl-
inder head, cylinder, fuel air and oil are readily controllable. The engines are adaptable to
many phases of research on internal combustion engines and have been most useful in fuel
research.

BY
MURRAY H. MILLER, Grad.EE
Apparently we stuck our readers with
the January Technic Teasers. That is we
stuck you with the card trick as the an-
swers we received to the other questions
were for the most part correct.
Let us restate the problem briefly. We
are in possession of three cards of the fol-
lowing colorings. One is red on both
sides, one is white on both sides, and the
third is red on one side and white on the
other. We put one card, place it on the
table, and find ourselves gazing at a red
face. We wish to know the probability
that the other face is also red.
As with most probability problems a
basic premise upon which a solution will
be built must be assumed. The most rea-
sonable premise in this case is the as-
sumption of an equal probability of our
seeing any one of the six possible faces
when we lay a card on the table. This is
to say that we disregard any factors that
might tend toward our choosing any par-
ticular card over another and further we
may with equal liklihood choose either
side of any card we draw as the side we
will expose.
We will now introduce some nomencla-
ture. We will call the two faces on the
card having both red Ra and Rb respec-
tively. We shall similarly denote the sides
of the card having two white sides by W„
and Wb. Finally we shall denote the sides
of the remaining card by Rc and Wc cor-
responding to the red and white sides re-
spectively.
We can now draw the following sched-
ule enumerating all the possible different
cases obtainable by drawing a card and
looking at one exposed face.

We note that there are only six possible
arrangements. Referring now to our prob-
lem, we have found ourselves gazing at a
red face. Consequently of the six pos-
sible cases we can eliminate three as not
having occurred. We have remaining
cases I, II, and III as possibilities. Of
these three remaining cases it is noted
that two have for the hidden face a red
side and only one possibility of the hid-
den face being white. We have then a
probability of two thirds that the hidden
face in our problem is a red side. In
terms of odds the answer to the problem
would be two to one.
All of the answers we received to this
problem maintained that the odds were
correctly stated as one to one. These an-
swers were based on the premise that
there were only two possibilities as to the
color of the hidden face, either red or
white. This is quite true but it is not suffi-
cient to justify saying that there is equal
likelihood of occurance of red and white
hidden sides.
We suggest if you are somewhat dubi-
ous about our answer that you perform a
number of trials with suitable cards and
see what limit the ratio of the number of
times the hidden face is red to the total
number of trials approaches.
As a matter of interest and along the
lines of the preceding discussion we will
outline a rather unique method of calcu-
lating the value of n. Choose, and write
a large number of fractions. When you
have a fairly large number of fractions,
say about twenty, count the number of
fractions whose numerators and denomi-
nators are prime to each other, i.e., the
number of fractions in their lowest terms.
Divide this number by the total number
of fractions used. Multiply the resulting
fraction by six and take the square root of
your result. This will give a value close
to ir. The more fractions you choose orig-
inally the closer you will approach to tr.
Here is a variation on the coin prob-
lem presented in a previous issue. Con-
sider twelve coins, all tried and true coin

of the realm excepting one which is
counterfeit. We desire to determine the
counterfeit under the following condi-
tions. We are restricted to the use of only
a chemical balance in determining which
is the counterfeit, i.e., we can determine
only relative weights. Further we are re-
stricted to using the balance only three
times. Can you help us.
Let us try an easy one just for a
breather. At twelve o'clock the hour and
minute hands on a clock are together.
Now it is apparent that there will be other
times when the two hands are together
again. Accurate to fractions of a second,
at what other times does this particular
juxtaposition occur? We desire the speci-
fied accuracy to avoid wear and tear on
your watch.
Do you feel refreshed now? Try this
one then. Two ferry boats leave from
their respective piers which are directly
across a river from one another. They
pass each other at a point 720 yards from
one shore. Each boat then docks for fif-
teen minutes and then starts back toward
its original pier. On the return trip the
two boats pass each other at a point 400
yards from the shore opposite to that re-
ferred to above. Now we would like to
know just how wide is the river at the
place where the ferry boats run?
Let's take another break. Here is a
quickie. A hunter leaves his camp at sun-
rise and walks five miles south. At this
point he shoots a bear. He then walks
five miles west to look at one of his traps.
Since there is nothing in the trap he walks
five miles north and so finds himself
back at his camp. Now, and we ask this
seriously, what was the color of the bear
that he shot?

minute flight at altitude at Edwards Aid
Force Base, Muroc, Calif., on January 23.
Designed for catapult take-off from car-
riers and rapid climb to the upper atmo-
sphere, the XF4D fulfills the need for a
fighter which can intercept an enemy be-
fore he reaches a position to attack the
fleet or ground installations, the navy said.
In appearance, the new interceptor is a
swept wing with web-like planform and a
slender nose extending forward to pro-
vide a cockpit. It has no tail.
According to the announcement, the
new jet is one of the first Navy fighters
designed specifically for interception.
The XF4D was designed and built
by the Douglas Aircraft company El Se-
gundo Division, where the Navy F3D Sky-
night, twin-jet night fighter, A-D-Sky-
raider, attack craft of Korean fame, and
the A2D turboprop carrier plane, are in
production.
Professor A. B. Macnee Wins
I.R.E. Award
One of the highlights of the Institute
1324 of the November, 1949 issue of the
Proceedings of the I.R.E.
Dr. Macnee entered the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1938 and, after
receiving his B.S. and M.S. degrees,
joined the staff of the M. I. T. Radiation
Laboratory in 1943. He began work
upon his doctorate in 1945 and upon re-
ceiving it in 1948, he became a Research
Associate in the Research Laboratory of
Electronics at M. I. T
It was during this time that Dr. Mac-
nee, working with Dr. Henry Wallman,
Associate Professor of Mathematics,
M. I. T., designed and built the bantam-
size electronic differential analyzer—the
subject of his prize-winning paper.
In Dr. Macnee's words, "A differential
analyzer of this type bears the same rela-
tion to the larger differential analyzers
which a slide rule bears to a desk calcu-
lating machine. In other words, it gives
faster results with only slightly less ac-
curacy."
The electronic analyzer presents the
answers to its problems in terms of
graphs on a television-like screen. To
keep this picture continuously bright and
clear, the machine repeats its solution to
every problem 60 times per second. Al-
though more than 200 radio tubes of var-
ious kinds are used, the analyzer requires
no more power than three electric irons.
The analyzer is accurate to within 1 to 5
percent.
Before he joined the U. of M. faculty
in September 1950, Professor Macnee was
a Research Associate at the Chalmers
Technical Institute in Gothenberg,
Sweden.
At present, Professor Macnee has stu-
dents in both of the radio communication
courses—E.E. 120 and 121. This semes-
ter he introduced a new course to the cur-
riculum of the E. E. Department, E. E.
205, a course in network synthesis.
Dr. Macnee is a member of the national
engineering honoraries, Tau Beta Pi and
Eta Kappa Nu as well as Sigma Xi, na-
tional research honorary. He is also an
Associate of the Institute of Radio Engi-
neering.
As a professor rapidly gaining popular-
ity among his students, Dr. Macnee has
also achieved notoriety for his rapid de-
livery of material to classes, a delivery
which even the five-minute radio commen-
tators could be envious.

bends, this method of testing can measure the
degree to which bent pipe thins on the outside
and thickens on the inside of the bend, assuring
full specified thickness in high temperature, high

Economy of production is directly de-
pendent on proper tooling and manufac-
turing methods, and improper tooling and
methods have frequently been responsible
for increasing the cost of an airplane. A
fallacy has gained currency since the war,
to the effect that production tooling in the
aircraft industry is tooling closely resem-
bling that used in the automotive industry.
Since automobile tooling is designed to
produce as many as 5,000 units a month,
and aircraft have never been produced at a
rate of more than approximately 500 units
a month, it is obvious that automobile-
type tooling is not at all suited to pres-
ent types of aircraft.
Production Tooling
In the aviation industry we constantly
hear the phrase "production tooling" used
by people who apparently do not have an
intimate enough knowledge of its impli-
cations to correct their erroneous impres-
sion that after completing the experi-
mental stage of an airplane it is just a
matter of laying out a given amount of
money, building production tools, and go-
ing into any rate of production that hap-
pens to be required. It is not generally
known that there is no one thing or group
of things that can be singled out and de-
fined as "production tooling." Every tool
is a production tool, whether it be a screw-
driver or a multi-spindled profiling ma-
chine.
Production tooling for one contract is
entirely different from production tool-
ing for the next contract, if the new con-
tract calls for a different rate and quan-
tity—even though it be for the same air-
plane. Moreover, it is not generally under-
stood that considerable production cost
can be saved by avoiding the use of too
many tools.
In order to take advantage of the rela-
tively unexploited field of economy that
exists in their proper design and wise
selection, it is necessary to understand
why we use tools. Whether it be to save
dollars, to save man hours or elapsed
hours, the one and only purpose of a tool
is to effect economy. Anything can be
fabricated more accurately by hand than
with a tool, but only at a tremendous
extra cost in time. A flat surface can be
hand-scraped to a closer tolerance than
it can be tool-ground. A man would never
buy a surface grinder just to make one
square block. However, he would buy the
grinder if he had such a large quantity
of blocks to be made that the grinder
would save enough money to pay for it-
self.
Thus also in industry, we use tools
when they will effect enough of a saving
to pay for themselves—and we must be
careful not to order more tools than we
need.
An Example of Economy
Suppose that in a certain airplane,
there is a rib assembly requiring 500
rivets. We find that the rivet holes can
be laid out and drilled in 4 hours per as-
sembly; and on the other hand, that we
can make a drill plate at a cost of 150
hours and drill the holes in yz hour; or
again, that we can make drill tools for
the detail parts at a cost of 500 hours
and drill the holes in y4 hour. If we have
20 ships to make, the comparison would
be as follows:
BY HAND LAYOUT
Tools 0
Manufacturing time
20 pes. (a 4 hours 80
TOTAL 80 hrs.
BY DRILL PLATE
Tools 150
Manufacturing time
20 pes. @ 1/2 nour 10
TOTAL 160 hrs.
BY DETAIL TOOLS
Tools 500
Manufacturing time
20 pes. @ \/4 hour 5
TOTAL 505 hrs
From this comparison we would choose
the old-fashioned, slow, hand-layout
method for the 20 ship contract. How-
ever, if we had a contract for 44 planes
we would find the drill plate more eco-
nomical, and if we had a contract for
1,401 units we would find the detail tools
more economical.
If we had an initial contract of 20
ships with a stipulation to tool for 500,
we could order the drill plate at the be-
ginning of the initial production—or
later, in case the customer so specified.
Just as the foregoing illustrates the
effect of the quantity of production on
tooling and manufacturing methods, the
following comparison shows how the rate
of production changes the tooling concept.
One tool might efficiently produce one
unit per day, but it would take 100 dupli-
cates of this tool to produce 100 per day.
For 100 per day, it will invariably prove
more economical to change the whole se-
quence of operations—involving a change
in the design of the part—and use a se-
ries of say five or six more elaborate
tools, each having a capacity of 100 per
day.
Importance of Cooperation
It follows then, that by full use of such
comparisons, the most economical produc-
tion can be achieved. This economy de-
pends not only on the type of tooling
used, but on the engineering design and
the manufacturing facilities as well. In
the case of the choice between a set of
duplicate tools and a series of different
tools, the engineer must design for the
particular manufacturing method in-
volved—since it is not often possible to
greatly vary the method without chang-
ing the design. As for choosing between
hand methods and elaborate tooling
methods, it must be ascertained that ade-
quate shop facilities and personnel will
be available to accomplish the result with
whichever method is selected.
The tool planner, in close coordination
with the engineering and manufacturing
departments, pares down costs by this
procedure of constantly comparing one
method against another and determining
the most economical one for the job at
hand. By being conversant with the over-
all picture from quotation to delivery,
from flight characteristics to rivet sizes,
he avoids false economy—saving on one
part and overcompensating through added
expenses to another.
Little by little, the tool planner cuts
down the overall cost to a minimum. He
starts with the contract bid, injects his
ideas into the engineer's earliest thinking
on the project, and from the engineer's
conception of the design makes the con-
tract tooling estimate. He establishes an
outline of the manufacturing sequence
and the assembly breakdown for the pur-
pose of scheduling. He confers with the
engineer throughout the initial stages of
design, so that the aircraft will be adapt-
able to economical manufacture.

transport is especially popular in South America.
A little before midnight on the evening
of May 5, 1950, a group of 26 students
from the University of Michigan student
chapter of the Institute of Aeronautical
Sciences boarded a bus near the East Engi-
neering Building. Seven sleepy hours
later they were having breakfast near
Toronto, Ontario, and hopefully looking
forward to visiting the A. V. Roe and
Dehavilland aircraft factories.
Due to difficulties in the postal system
the group was not expected at A. V. Roe,
but upon their arrival the necessary ar-
rangements were made to conduct a tour
through the factory, hangars, and test
cells. Much of the work done there is of

a restricted nature so the cameras were
left on the bus. Engineers familiar with
the whole layout answered as many ques-
tions and showed as much of the factory
as possible without violating security.
Lancaster bombers and Sea Fury fighters
were being repaired alongside the manu-
facture of plowshares as the company tried
to make full use of its equipment. In an-
other section the turbine blades of the
Arenda axial flow jet were carried from
the design stage through to the last ma-
chining process. Out in the hangar the
CF (twin jet, two place fighter) stood
alongside the Avro Jetliner with a capac-
ity of 60 passengers, which has invaded
the civilian market for short-range trans-
portation. The beauty of design and
workmanship in both ships impressed
everyone. Visiting of the test cells for
the Arenda jet was anticlimatic, and a
short time later, the group returned to the
bus discussing the shortcomings of com-
parable American aircraft.
Dehavilland Plant
After arrival at Dehavilland, four
groups were formed with an engineer
guiding each one. The executives moved
from group to group and justifiably were
proud of the plant's production. Here
very little was restricted and cameras

clicked madly as components of the famed
Beaver were made and assembled. This
plane was designed structurally and aero-
dynamically to operate in the wilds of
Northern Canada. High lift airfoil with
flaps combine with a fuselage as rugged as
a railroad boxcar to make the plane capa-
ble of getting in and out of makeshift
airfields, with a large load. Nearby the
"Chipmunk" stood out as evidence of ver-
satility in production. This two place
trainer with its low wings and inverted
inline engine glistened and its sleek lines
showed no evidence of its small gross
weight (approximately 1600 lbs.). Re-
markable savings in weight were due part-
ly to the use of bent aluminum channels
rather than steel tubing for strength. This
plane is licensed in both the United States
and Canada for all types of flying and has
no structural weaknesses.
Worker Attitude
One of the noticeable attributes of
Dehavilland is the attitude of the work-
ers toward the management and their job
in general. Especially in the overhaul de-
partment for Goblin jet engines one no-
tices a familiarity with theory and the
"why" behind procedures. Here each
engine is detail stripped and each part
checked before being reassembled. As
the groups went out on the field a Vam-
pire was whining in static thrust as the
pilot and mechanic checked the installa-
tion. This fighter is one of the most man-
euverable in the world, and the reason
was soon apparent. The fuselage is pod
type, of wood with the jet intake in the
wings. Twin booms support the tail sec-
tion and derive a large portion of their
strength from the skin. Altogether it
combines the advantages of the Japanese
Zero with twice the speed. Inside the fac-
tory these were being repaired alongside
some PBY's which the workers were
modifying.
Back in the administration building
Dehavilland's wartime activities were
brought to life by movies of their war
effort, and this completed a most won-
derful day. The IAS group was the first
to visit these factories on such a trip and
the welcome with which they were re-
ceived surely encourages more trips of this
kind.
Other IAS Activities
The IAS sponsors many student activi-
ties. During the fall semester of 1950 a
field trip was made to the NACA Lewis
Flight Propulsion Laboratory near Cleve-
land. Several interesting meeings were
held with topics embracing all engineering
fields as they apply to the aeronautical
sciences. The annual I.A.S. banquet and
dance for the 1950-51 school year fea-
tured an interesting lecture on computing
machines. Any Aero student is welcome
to participate in I.A.S. activities.

"Mr. Bell, I heard every word you said —distinctly/"
75 YEARS OF TELEPHONE SERVICE
On the evening of March 10, 1876,
on the top floor of a boarding house in
Boston, the telephone carried its first
intelligible sentence.
It seemed like a miracle to our
grandparents and great-grandparents.
Yet today, the telephone is a part of
our everyday living. And that is the
real miracle—the fact that the tele-
phone has come to mean so much to so
many people in so many ways.
The telephone is an indispensable
tool of business and government — to-
day's tremendous job of production
and defense could not be carried on
without it. It serves in minor emer-
gencies and great ones. It helps main-
tain family and community ties. And it
keeps right on growing and improving.
Never in the history of the tele-
phone has it been so valuable to so
many people as right now.

How often the claim "SAVE TIME"
is heard in these recovery years. The
development of new products and the
improvement of old products that pro-
duce results once thought impossible is
becoming almost commonplace and un-
less factual proof is presented, there is
tendency to doubt some of these accom-
plishments. In the case mentioned, the
facts disclosed that the gear manufacturer
had used hobs made of one of the new
"super" high-speed steels.
Composition and Properties
"Super" high-speed steels, as they will
be called in this article, may be classified,
metallurgically, as high-carbon, high-
vanadium high-speed steels. They contain
more carbon and up to 5 percent vana-
dium as compared to 1 per cent vanadium
for the conventional "18-4-1" high-speed
steels. The high carbon and high vana-
dium content promote high hardness and
toughness characteristics. Some varieties
contain cobalt in order to increase the
quality of hot hardness and permit tools
of this steel to operate at still higher
cutting speeds.
One of the earliest "super" high-speed
steels was developed several years ago
and was used almost exclusively for mak-
ing broaches. Today the field of applica-
tion has been expanded to include a wide
assortment of other tools such as reamers,
metal cutting saws, milling cutters, hobs,
gear cutters and twist drills. These tools
frequently are applied on particularly
difficult jobs where the tool must have
strength and toughness and at the same
time hold its cutting edges longer than
conventional high-speed steel tools.
Hardness and Toughness
"Super" high-speed steel tools stay
sharp longer because of their high hard-
ness and toughness characteristics. The
very qualities which make these steels out-
standing in tool life and performance also
account for their grinding resistance.
Hardness and toughness properties affect
the grinding resistance: high hardness in-
creases resistance to penetration by the

abrasive; high toughness increases resis-
tance to abrasion because the surface of
the steel has to be worked more to cut the
chips loose. Therefore, it is not unusual to
obtain somewhat greater wheel wear
when grinding these new steels. In gen-
eral, the greater abrasive resistance of
"super" high-speed steel will result in
3 to 4 times more wheel wear than when
grinding "18-4-1" steel. If this is under-
stood there wi'l be less bewilderment and
trouble when grinding it for the first
time.
To insure close tolerance with respect
to dimensions and uniformity of tooth
height, it is desirable to use as large a
grinding wheel as possible. This will pro-
vide a larger volume of abrasive in the
grinding wheel and minimize the possi-
bility of losing size due to radial wheel
wear.
Grindability
Some of these "super" high-speed steels
have more grinding resistance than others.
In tests conducted in the Norton Research
Laboratories, their grindability appeared
to vary with the vanadium content, i.e.
the higher the percentage of vanadium,
the greater the grinding resistance. It is
presumed that the wear resistance of the
tool is also increased. The term grind-
ability" may be defined as the relative ease
with which metal can be removed by
grinding. It does not embrace the charac-
teristic of sensitivity to cracking.
Slow Wheel Speed
During the grindability tests referred
to, an unexpected improvement in grind-
ing wheel performance was noted for
high-speed steels with iy2 per cent or
more vanadium. By lowering the wheel
speed from 5000 to 3000 s.f.p.m. the rela-
tively soft wheel, 32A46-F12VBEP, norm-
ally recommended, seemed to grind even
cooler. The power required dropped near-
ly 50 per cent while the rate of wheel
wear increased only slightly. Actually,
with the lower wheel speed it is possible
to use an appreciably harder grade wheel
such as 32A60-M8VBE, with correspond-
ingly less wheel wear and without burning
the work.
If difficulty is encountered in grinding
sizable pieces to finish size because of the
wheel wear, the lower wheel speed should
be tried, if available. This procedure ap-
plies to surface, cylindrical and some form
grinding operations. These advantages
of lower wheel speeds do not seem to ap-
ply in the case of conventional "18-4-1"
high-speed steels.
Comparison of Abrasives
In general, Alundum (aluminum ox-
ide) abrasives are better suited than Crys-
tolon (silicon carbide) abrasive for grind-
ing the "super" high-speed steels. Crysto-
lon wheels cut more slowly and wear
faster, and also give higher power read-
ings. Diamond wheels are not suitable
because of the prohibitively high wheel
wear resulting from the dressing action
of the tough steel. Of the various Alun-
dum abrasives tested, 32 Alumdum abra-
sive, Norton Company's most recent de-
velopment, gave the best all around re-
sults.
"Super" high-speed steel was examined
in the Norton Research Laboratories. The
complex vanadium particles are over twice
as hard as the iron carbide particles in
ordinary carbon tool steel and even slight-
ly harder on the average than aluminum
oxide abrasive. Therefore, one might ex-
pect that silicon carbide abrasive, which is
appreciably harder than aluminum oxide
abrasive, would be the logical abrasive to
use. This would be true if the metal con-
sisted entirely of vanadium carbide. How-
ever, the vanadium carbide occurs in the
form of widely dispersed microscopic par-
ticles in a matrix which is most effectively
ground with Alundum abrasive. While
such steels can be ground with Crystolon
wheels and consideration of grinding con-
ditions.

With silica, water and imagination
Du Pont scientists have found
How to Tame Slippery Floors
Teen-agers in high schools used to
have great, if hazardous, fun running
and sliding on newly waxed corridor
floors. Of late many of them haven't
been able to do that. For numerous
schools, as well as office buildings
and institutions, are now using waxes
that have been made skid-resistant.
The product that is taming slip-
pery floors is "Ludox" colloidal silica
—adapted by Du Pont chemists to
floor wax through cooperative re-
search with the wax industry.
If you mix plain sand with floor
wax, you'll have an anti-slip surface,
but it would be unsightly and thor-
oughly impractical. With "Ludox,"
you are using a water suspension of
invisible colloidal silica particles less
than a millionth of an inch in diam-
eter.
A problem child
"Ludox" was quite a problem child
to scientists who developed it. For
instance, research men had to know
how silica would act in the presence
of floor wax. So they turned to the
electron microscope and learned that
the little silica spheres attach them-
selves firmly to the surfaces of wax
spheres five times their size.
But it was also necessary to find
out how "Ludox" affects a waxy film

"Ludox" particles (dark, in this electron photo-
micrograph) surroundfhe larger wax particles
throughout depth of film. Magnified 25,000 x.

Du Pont "Ludox" makes floor waxes harder
as well as safer. Other wax qualities—gloss,
freeze- and water-resistance, leveling—are un-
affected. It is now used by many manufacturers.
after it is laid down on a floor. While
a polished waxed floor looks smooth
enough, it is actually a series of hills
and valleys and these irregularities
have an important bearing on the
behavior of a surface.
Working with a waxed surface pre-
sented difficulties. The electron mi-
croscope functions only if electron
beams can pass through the mem-
brane upon which the specimen is
placed. And electrons can't "see
through" a floor!
Study In duplication
Often, problems like this have been
solved by preparing a thin replica or
copy of the surface for examination
in its stead. However, the conven-
tional method for making a replica—

4444

CroK-tection of wax film shows how pressure
of foot pushes the hard "Ludox" particles into
the wax, causing a snubbing action.
the one frequently used in studying
metals—requires solvents. These
would dissolve and ruin a wax surface.
So it became necessary for the
chemists and electron microscopists
to develop an entirely new way to
make a replica of a surface. This they
did, as part of a research program
that lasted several years.
With it some remarkable pictures
were made. They showed that many
"Ludox" particles stay at the sur-
face of a wax film, even though they
are denser than wax. As you walk on
a floor, your shoe presses the tiny
silica particles down into the wax
spheres that make up the film. This
sets up a snubbing action which keeps
you from slipping.
Much more could be told about
Du Pont research on colloidal silica.
For example, chemical and mechan-
ical engineers had to develop manu-
facturing equipment, including a spe-
cially designed ion exchange column.
Organic and physical chemists used
research findings to formulate better
waxes, as well as silica-containing
adhesives and anti-slip treatments
for rayon fabrics. Like practically all
Du Pont achievements, "Ludox" is
the result of close, continuous team-
work of men and women trained in
many fields of science.

Changed Conditions
One year ago at this time the employment outlook for
engineering graduates, while good, indicated that it might take
some strenuous effort on the part of the individual, himself,
to find a job immediately; that probably 10 per cent of the
class would have to do some scratching.
Inside of 63 days there was a decided change in the em-
p'oyment temperature. All graduates found positions imme-
diately, or at lea:t very shortly after graduation, and since that
time representatives from industry have fairly flocked to the
campus in search of likely young engineers. These changed
conditions are wide-spread and came abruptly.
Regardless of present conditions, the young man, in at-
tempting to project his future in the engineering field, should
study a report entitled "The Engineering Profession in Transi-
tion," which was published by the Engineers Joint Council in
1947. In this report, by charts and tables, we learn of the
growth of the engineering profession, graduate—nongraduate
composition and engineering qualifications of its practitioners,
salary rates of graduate and non-graduate engineers, geographi-
cal distribution, and several other interesting and valuable occu-
pational statistics concerning the membership of the profession
as of that date. In spite of the changes which have taken place
since 1947, the data contained in this report presents a blueprint
with which every engineer should be familiar.
From an educational standpoint, engineering is not a closed
profession; that is, 4.1 per cent of all engineers as reported by
this survey had had no college education. Thirteen percent of
the practitioners had not finished college. On the other hand,
nearly 4 percent of all engineers possessed doctor's degrees and
approximately 15 percent have the master's degree. The several
branches of the profession vary widely from the average figures
quoted.
Scholarships
On a previous occasion I have mentioned some of the ad-
vantages connected with military service. One of these which
should be forcibly emphasized is the opportunity afforded the
young man to secure for himself a scholarship covering, say, two
years at almost any university he wishes to attend. In the lowest
grade, the American soldier is a comparatively well-paid man,
even in these days of inflation. He receives, as a minimum,
$75.00 a month and has everything furnished. His cash income,
then, would be $1950 for 26 months of service. A very con-
siderable portion of this sum can be saved; enough, in fact, to
pay tuition and, in addition, nearly all other necessary expenses
for two years.
In addition to the two monetary advantages, there will be,
of course, the advantage of some travel and, in some cases,
extensive travel. To the American youth such an experience
should have real educational value.

Managers
Recently, while lunching with a group of engineering and
business teachers and corporation personnel men, the conversa-
tion turned to the much-discussed shortage of young engineerj
at the present time and the probable more acute shortage within
two or three years.
A representative of one of the large utilities said that his
company always hired more young engineers than they would
need for strictly professional engineering positions. The com-
pany officials knew from past experience that a very large pro-
portion of its future managerial staff would come from these
young engineers and, for this reason, proposed to have plenty
of them on hand. Inasmuch as a very large percentage of all
engineers are in managerial work after twenty years' experience,
this utility data only bears out what we know is happening in
other lines of work. This situation makes it necessary for the
individual not interested in the managerial side to see to it that
he does not tarry too long in such work.
Demand for Engineering Graduates Increases
Forty-three corporations visited this campus or have sched-
uled a visit between the dates of February 12 and February 28.
These are all large, well-known corporations, several of them
with headquarters in Michigan, and they are all looking for
employees among the student body. In general, they are here to
secure graduates, although some corporations extend the oppor-
tunity for undergraduates to be employed during the summer
months. Certainly there never has been a time, even during the
lush years of 1946, -47 and -48, when engineering graduates
were in greater demand than they are at the present time.
Thirty-five corporations have already selected dates and made
arrangements to interview applicants during March. Undoubt-
edly, many more will make similar arrangements during the next
few days.
As has been intimated above, this demand will continue for
a number of years. As far as we can see into the future at the
present time, the situation is about this: Our mechanized
methods of living are expanding all the time and, consequently,
call for more engineers; during the past two or three years the
enrollments in engineering schools have shrunk; the world
situation demands that we arm ourselves, and this situation
calls for many more engineers in industry and in the armed
forces. There can be no doubt that for the next decade there
will be many more positions open for engineers than there will
be qualified people to fill them.

This car, and the men who
it

Back in 1928 Alcoa engineers pointed out the
advantages that aluminum would bring to
railroad tank cars carrying hard to hold
chemicals; easily contaminated foods. So
Alcoa designed and undertook to pay for
the first aluminum tank car. The car builder
and a shipper became interested. On comple-
tion of the car, the builder assumed the cost and
leased it to the shipper for regular service.
Interest in aluminum tank cars increased.
Impact recorders and strain gauges gave
the designers new data. The aluminum pro-
duction men rolled the heaviest plate;
made the largest rivets produced up to that
time. The second car was made from 8 in-


stead of 16 plates. Joining time cut in half!
Today three plates, plus heads, joined by
newly developed welding methods make an
aluminum tank car. And 1,300 of them, in-
cluding the first one ever made, are in service.
Another instance where Alcoa engineering
and co-operation have brought the advan-
tages of aluminum to a new application.
Throughout the Alcoa organization, in re-
search, production and sales, similar pioneer-
ing jobs are in progress now and others are
waiting for the men with the imagineering
ability to tackle them.

nation's defense production.
Engineers Critical
Industry today is plagued by a shortage
of materials, but its most critical shortage
may well turn out to be that of engineers
and scientists, according to Harry A.
Winne.
The G-E official recently served on a
Scientific Manpower Advisory Committee
appointed by Stuart Symington, director
of the National Security Resources Board.
He emphasized that the members of this
board realize the need for men to fill the
armed forces, but that they also realize that
men without adequate munitions and ma-
teriel are almost valueless.
"We also have full comprehension of
the fact that men in civilian industry pro-
duce this materiel, and especially that
engineers and scientists must be available
for research, development, and design of
new munitions and other needs of the
military forces and the civilion popula-
tion," he said.
"In the first place, in the majority of
cases, an individual cannot be sure he is
destined for immediate military service,"
the G-E official continued. "In the second
place, an of much greater importance, the
vast majority of those who go into the
service will return to civilian life sooner
or later, and I think most of them will be
surprised at how soon that time will
come."
Mr. Winne advised the college stu-
dent to think now of that future, and to
get as much information as possible con-
cerning the opportunities which various
organizations in industry offer him.
"He should try to determine in what
kind of industry, and if possible, with
what company, he would like to cast his
lot in the future, and to get his name
and his history on the records of that and
other companies," Mr. Winne said.
Fireside Sunbath
The benefits of natural sunlight can be
simulated indoors all year long with the
20-watt fluorescent sun lamp developed
by engineers of the Westinghouse Lamp
Division, Bloomfield, N. J. (The tubular
lamp emits a concentrated band of radia-
tions in the mid-ultraviolet region of the
spectrum (2800-3200 Angstroms), which
is the erythemal or sun-tan-producing
wave length. The portable fixture can be
plugged into any standard electrical outlet.
The fluorescent sun lamp is five times
more efficient than sun lamps of previous
manufacture, and has a life of more than
4,000 hours as compared to the 1,000-hour
life of conventional types.

You need the confidence that comes
from wide experience, whether you
intend to be a salesman, designer, re-
searcher, or production
man. Confidence based
on knowledge is one of
the greatest assets an en-
gineer can have. Here is
what I mean.
You may visit a mine
with the idea of talking
about crushing equip-
arch cooper ment, but find that their
engineers have an electrical problem. Or
you may visit a utility to talk about elec-
trical equipment and find that they're all
excited about a pump break-down.
Offer Ail-Around Help
Can you help them?Orareyoujustanother

have problems on their minds. In my work
I call on electric utilities, cement plants,
machinery builders, textile mills, paper
mills, shoe factories and many other types
of plants. In each of them, I try to help
the engineers and mechanics I call on.
It's a good credo for salesmen, but it
takes broad experience to carry it out. It's
the kind of experience you must deliber-
ately set about acquiring as early as pos-
sible. I had heard of Allis-Chalmers equip-
ment, seen A-C's giant Corliss engines in
Australia's biggest power plant and de-

cided to study design at Allis-Chalmers.
It looked like the best place in the world
to get a broad engineering background.
I joined the Allis-Chalmers Graduate
Training Course after graduation from
Sydney Technical College in 1908 . . .
worked on steam turbines, wound coils of
all types, performed tests for the electrical
department. After that there were field
trips to erect electrical equipment. It was
soon apparent that I wasn't a designer at
heart, and my sales career started.
Broad Opportunity
Forty-one years later, Allis-Chalmers still
offers the same opportunity for broad
experience. A-C still builds equipment for
electric power, mining and ore reduction,
cement making, public works, pulp and
wood processing, and flour milling.
And the Allis-Chalmers Graduate
Training Course is still flexible. Students
help plan their own courses. They can
switch to design, manufacturing, research,
application, sales, or advertising—divide
their time between shops and offices—
and can earn advanced degrees in engi-
neering at the same time.
Men at Allis-Chalmers get a close-up
of the basic industries. No matter what
path they take in the industrial world, ex-
perience gained with this broad organiza-
tion lays a foundation for the confidence
that comes with all-around knowledge.

conduit has to bend easily,
yet not collapse, flake, chip or
crack. And when it's bent it must
retain the full bend. That's why
Sherarduct is so widely used
throughout the electrical indus-
try. It meets all of these require-
ments and more.
Sherarduct is made of mild, high-
grade steel that is Spellerized to
assure a fine, even-textured con-
duit. Because of its malleability
and ductility, it is easily bent,
with no spring back. When
Sherarduct is bent to 90° it stays
at 90°!
Sherarduct is speedily installed,
permits symmetrical conduit runs
and banks. It prevents costly hold
ups on the job, labor kick backs,
erratic flow of materials. When
you use Sherarduct, the whole
conduit installation goes up
faster, easier, more economically.

Could a wheel do It better?
A widely accepted method of finishing many parts
and tools is by application of an abrasive belt
of certain specifications. Yet, it is entirely possi-
ble that an improved method may some day be
devised—the use of a special-type abrasive wheel,
for instance... on a new type of polishing wheel.
Should this ever occur, carborundum would
undoubtedly be among the first to produce the
right wheel. But, even more important, we would
be fully prepared to explain the pros and cons
of both methods. Because only CARBORUNDUM
makes a complete line of abrasives.. .we can rec-
ommend impartially the right abrasive for every
application based on our experience with all
abrasive products.
Nor is this experience limited to abrasives. For,
among many diverse products, those of our
globar division are particularly unique. Ceramic
resistors are in great demand for many special
electronic applications. Non-metallic heating
elements are used increasingly for annealing,
brazing, treating and ceramic firing.

PROBLEM: You are designing a valve grinding
machine. You have to provide a drive for the chuck
that holds the valve stem. This chuck must be adjust-
able in three different directions. Your problem
now is to devise a method of driving the chuck which
permits these adjustments. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER: Use an S.S.White power
drive flexible shaft to transmit power to the chuck.
The shaft provides a positive, dependable drive
that permits free movement of the chuck in any
direction.

This is just one of hundreds of remote control and
power drive problems to which S.S.White flexible

TOOL PLANNING
(Continued from page 11)
Then, as the engineering drawings are released, he roughs
out the overall production plan and details it. He orders all
tooling and estimates the cost of each tool, so as to keep the
cost within the budget. He works out problems of skills, flow
and facilities with manufacturing personnel, lays out the pro-
duction floor and orders the necessary rearrangement of equip-
ment. Finally, he serves a liaison function on the manufactur-
ing floor, working out tool problems and reanalyzing the plan
for possible improvements.
An example of economy achieved by proper tooling methods
may be cited in the case of a large access door in an early stage
of design on a new contract. The planner recognized a difficult
forming operation to be involved in the one-piece coaming call-
ed for by the design. He had the choice of forming it in one
piece by hand, or in four pieces with simple tooling—but with
an increase in assembly cost. Again, if in one piece, he could
do the job with highly expensive forming tools.
His analysis determined at what quantities each of these
methods would become economical, and the compromise re-
sulted in the decision to use the one piece hand formed coam-
ing on the experimental model, with a change in design to the
four piece coaming on the anticipated production contract. This
quantity was not great enough to justify the expensive forming
tools.
A bad decision would have cost 500 man-hours on this single
part. With 35,000 parts to consider, the overall cost problem
becomes a sizable one.
Another example is seen in the case picked up by a tool
planner out in the manufacturing shop. On the outer wing of
a flying boat currently in production, it is necessary to back-
spot-face each of a long row of bolt holes along the upper con-
tour at the wing splice. The shop was spending about 3 man-
hours per wing on this job, and was breaking a large number
of spot face-cutters.
The planner was asked to provide a lever arm which would
lessen operator fatigue. His analysis showed the lever arm
would cast $80, and would not necessarily effect a saving. So
he tried a different spot-face cutter. By removing every alter-
nate tooth from the cutter, he greatly improved its efficiency,
reduced the physical effort required, cut down the time of oper-
ation from 3 hours to y2 hour per wing, and increased the life
of the cutter. All the cutters were changed for a cost of only
$3, and the lever arm was made unnecessary.
By this constant analysis of production tools and production
methods, at the Glenn L. Martin plant, tool planning con-
sistently and continuously pares production expenses. By mak-
ing such analyses, the Tool Planning Department constantly
builds up more tool planning experience to apply to future
contracts in the early design stages. Although there must al-
ways be a compromise between the best manufacturing practice
and the airplane's performance, the Martin planner has the
facts at his command so that the compromise can be made
most intelligently.
Economical production features are designed into the air-
plane, not through the employment of preconceived ideas of
"production tooling" as applied in other industries, but found-
ed on principles of tooling developed through practice and
accurately applied to the exact conditions peculiar to each
new contract.

Tiny crystals, which pass off torrents
of electrons when excited with X-rays,
promise to make possible for the first
time the high-speed inspection of thou-
sands of products, ranging from canned
baby food to blasting fuses, according to
scientists of the General Electric X-ray
Corporation.
The crystals, which are over 1,000 times
more sensitive than the photo-electric
cells used in "electric eye" applications,
also can be used to improve the perform-
ance of X-ray apparatus used to detect
and treat disease, the scientists said.
Capable of increasing a million times
the energy they receive from X-rays, the
crystals perform work that hitherto re-
quired a much more complex system of
vacuum tubes and amplifiers. Also only
low-power X-rays are required.
Canned or packaged products or any
one of a wide variety of possible items are
carried by conveyor between the crystals
and an X-ray machine, which is produc-
ing a low-power beam of X rays.
The item being inspected absorbed
some of the X-rays, the exact amount de-
pending upon the characteristics of the
item.
An inadequately-filled can of baby
food, for example, would absorb a quan-
tity different from that absorbed by a
satisfactorily filled can, the scientists ex-
plained.
The rest of the X-rays strike the crys-
tals, causing them to give off electrons.
When the crystals are hit by X-rays pass-
ed by an unsatisfactory item, they gener-
ate sufficient electrons to actuate relay
devices which call attention to the defec-
tive item.
The relay devices can operate a meter
or chart a graph upon which certain fluc-
tuations would indicate an unsatisfactory
item. Or they can cause a light to flash
or paint to be dabbed on a faulty part. Or
they can actually stop an entire production
line until the faulty product or process
is eliminated, the scientists said.
Because of the high sensitivity of the
crystals, X-rays necessary to actuate them
are far below the intensity and quantity at
which the item or the user of the item

would be affected in any way, the scientists
emphasized.
A new inspection technique employ-
ing the crystals promises to perform at
unprecedented speeds, inspecting as many
as 600 units per minute in the case of
canned foods and liquids, it was said.
Operating as a sort of industrial "slave
eye," the crystals may solve such inspec-
tion problems as controlling and check-
ing the product level in containers; de-
tecting voids, cracks, and variation in ma-
terial thickness in a wide variety of homo-
geneous materials; checking for absence,
misplacement, or misalignment of inserts
and other internal parts and even eventu-
ally spotting foreign particles in certain
foods, metals and other products.
Laboratory models of the crystal detec-
tion equipment have inspected rubber
heels, gaged the product level in baby
food, soup, beer, and other canned and
packaged products, and checked for voids
in powder trains used in blasting fuse.
Measuring "Nothing" Precisely
A perfect vacuum is one of those goals
that scientists continually strive for but
will never attain. But as they come ever
closer one question becomes increasingly
important: just how close are we? The
answer is not easy—the closer you come to
"nothingness" the harder it is to measure.
A new ion gauge—some 200 times more
sensitive to pressures than any previous
device—adds to the preciseness with
which engineers can measure vacuums.
One day last spring, engineers in the
Interatomics Physics Section of the West-
inghouse Research Laboratories were per-
forming one of the important tasks that

course necessary to evacuate the tube as

Yes, the melting point of fused alumi-
num oxide (as made by Norton from
the mineral bauxite under the regis-
tered trade-mark Alundum) is 3722°F.
That's why it's such a popular re-
fractory material. Because it also
possesses high thermal conductivity
and low electrical conductivity when
hot, it is used extensively in both
fuel and electrically heated furnaces.

Harder Than
Cemented Tungsten Carbide
Alundum grains in various crystalline
structures are widely used as abra-
sives. On the Knoop scale, they have
a hardness of 2000, the same as the
sapphire.
As the world's largest manufacturer
of abrasives, Norton has worked
wonders with Alundum grains. High-

ln the Norton Ceramic Laboratory O.J. Whittemore,
Jr., B. S., Iowa State '40, operates a load test
furnace of his design — a furnace that tests
refractories at temperatures up to 2450 C.
ly skilled, college-trained research
men in Norton's laboratories have
succeeded in giving to Alundum
abrasives a wide range of physical
properties by controlling the size of
crystals and their chemical and
physical properties.
32 Alundum Abrasive
The crowning achievement in alumi-
num oxide chemistry was the crea-
tion by Norton of a unique single-
crystal grain structure of unusual
sharpness. Named "32 Alundum," it
has been hailed as the "greatest
abrasive contribution to increased
grinding production in more than 40
years."
Remember Norton
There is a bright future in the abra-
sive industry for young engineers

INSIST ON STRENGTH
in pipe for city streets
Long life and low maintenance cost of
mains laid under city streets depend
not only on effective resistance to corrosion
but on definite strength factors. The
four strength factors that pipe must have
to withstand beam stress, external
loads, traffic shocks and severe working
pressures, are listed on the page opposite.
No pipe that is deficient in any of
these strength factors should ever be
laid in paved streets of cities, towns or
villages. Cast iron water and gas mains,
laid over a century ago, are serving
in the streets of more than 30 cities in
the United States and Canada. Such
service records prove that cast iron pipe
not only resists corrosion but combines
all the strength factors of long life
with ample margins of safety.

STRENGTH
The ability of cast iron pipe to withstand
external loads imposed by heavy fill and un-
usual traffic loads is proved by the Ring
Compression Test Standard 6-inch cast iron
pipe withstands a crushing weight of more
than 14,000 lbs. per foot
When cast iron pipe is subjected to beam
stress caused by soil settlement, or disturbance
of soil by other utilities, or resting on an ob-
struction, tests prove that standard 6-inch cast
iron pipe in 10-foot span sustains a load of
15.000 lbs.
The toughness of cast iron pipe which enables
it to withstand impact and traffic shocks, as
well as the hazards in handling, is demon-
strated by the Impact Test While under hydro-
static pressure and the heavy blows from a
50 pound hammer, standard 6-inch cast iron
pipe does not crack until the hammer Is
dropped 6 times on the same spot from pro-
gressively Increased heights of 6 inches.
In full length bursting tests standard 6-inch
cast iron pipe withstands more than 2500 lbs.
per square inch internal hydrostatic pressure,
which proves ample ability to resist water-
hammer or unusual working pressures.

equipment installation and an ample steam supply. If steam is
not available from existing sources, an investment of about
$5,000 would be required for the purchase and installation of a
suitable "packaged" steam-generating unit.
An additional investment for building and land would be
needed if new construction is necessary to furnish floor area for
feather processing. In determining the building investment it
was estimated that a one-story building with approximately
3,400 square feet of floor area would be satisfactory. It was as-
sumed that construction costs would be about $6 per square foot.

The approximations above are intended to serve only as a
guide, since building costs vary considerably with locality and
type of construction. A total investment of about $80,000 would
be required to construct and newly equip a self-contained plant
capable of processing the equivalent of 10 tons of dry feathers
per day.
Total Processing Costs

costs incurred in the steam treatment of feathers amount to ap-

proximately $34 per ton of product.
There are several ways of reducing both investment and proc-
essing costs. If the feather process is installed as a side line in
an established industrial plant, the use of common supervision,
available storage space, existing utilities, and other facilities
would result in some savings. Stack gases or waste steam
might be used to operate the rotary drier.
Constant operation at full capacity would also lower process-
ing costs. The required investment could be cut down con-
siderably if the process were used by a rendering plant to utilize
idle equipment. This application of the process may be the
most logical.
Product
The dry, ground product resulting from the steam treatment
of feathers weighs 52-60 pounds per cubic foot. It can be used
directly as a conditioning agent in mixed organic fertilizers, or
as a source material for the preparation of a plaster retarder.
It has water-insoluble nitrogen activity well above that required
of organic fertilizers. Analytical data for processed feathers con-
taining 12 percent moisture are as follows:
percent
Total nitrogen 12.1-13.6
Water-insoluble organic nitrogen 9.8-13.1
Water-insoluble organic nitrogen soluble in
neutral KMn04 9.5-12.8
Active water-insoluble organic nitrogen distilled
from alkaline KMn04 6.6- 7.9
Activity water-insoluble nitrogen:
Alkaline KMnO, method 67.3-60.3
Neutral KMn04 method 96.9-97.7
Other potential uses are indicated by its protein properties
and its amino acid content.
The special values of the product as fertilizer consist in its
effectiveness as a conditioning agent for inorganic mixed ferti-
lizers and in its slow release of nitrogen. As a conditioning
agent it prevents the caking of inorganic fertilizer salt by absorp-
tion of moisture, thus permitting uniform spreading of the
mixed fertilizer. The slow release of nitrogen is an advantage
for greenhouses, lawns, and other applications where a steady
supply of nitrogen is required. This property is indicated by
the analysis above and has been demonstrated in use tests. In
general the nitrogen in organic fertilizer commands about twice
the price of inorganic fertilizer nitrogen. On the current fer-
tilizer market, the feather product would probably command a
price of about $60 per ton.
The material can be used in the preparation of plaster re-
tarders. For this use the feather product has essentially the same
characteristics as hoof meal, which sells for about $130 per
ton on the current market.
Another potential use for the feather product is in the prep-
aration of a fire-control foam compound. No immediate outlet
for such use is known, however. The feather protein would
compete in this use with other protein.
There is a possibility that the feather product can be used as a
feed component. Such use would depend on extensive feeding
studies. The product is relatively high in arginine, one of the
feed component. Such use would depend on extensive feeding
amonio acids considered essential for the feeding of poultry.
Used as a poultry feed component the material would probably
command a higher price than as a compenent of fertilizer.

How to control a fast ball
When a jet airplane nears flying speed, its turbine rotor
is spinning about 12,000 to 15,000 rpm. At that speed
everything in the engine takes a beating.
Thrust and centrifugal forces are at work. Heat causes
expansion stresses. Any imbalance sets up vibration.
Then there is friction.
A jet engine is no spot for a part that can't take it.
One of the components that lead a hard life is the ball
bearing for the main rotor shaft. It must be light in
weight and compact. It must compensate quickly for
distortion resulting from rapid and wide temperature
changes. Shaft rigidity must be maintained and the bear-
ing must overcome heavy gyroscopic forces and powerful
thrust loads to do so. The shaft must be perfectly
balanced to eliminate vibration at high rotary speeds.
An important part of the bearing is the ball retainer.
A large bearing manufacturer selected Synthane lami-
nated plastic for his retainer.
Synthane is tough and highly resistant to wear and
abrasion. Synthane is light in weight. Synthane is di-
mensionally stable over the temperature ranges en-
countered. Oils or greases have little or no effect upon it.
These arc a few Synthane characteristics. It has many
others—physical, mechanical, chemical and electrical.
This Synthane combination of properties and charac-
teristics may be the answer to one of your problems.

which many would say is as low as one
could attain. But Dr. Daniel Alpert, head
of the group, was convinced that the vac-
uum they were obtaining was even better
than the device indicated, and that some
inherent limitation in the conventional ion
gauge prevented a reading below this
value. So he assigned engineer Robert T.
Bayard to investigate. After weeks of ex-
perimentation, it was discovered that the
conventional ion gauge was no longer
reading the gas chamber accurately but
was indicating a current produced by very
soft x-rays within the tube itself. With
this information a new ionization gauge
was developed that virtually eliminated
the x-ray effect and made it possible to
read pressures as low as 5 X 1^)~11 mm
of mercury.
The ion gauge resembles a triode
vacuum tube in structure. The ion col-
lector is a fine wire, which runs up
through the center of the tube. Surround-
ing it is the cylindrical grid. Outside the
grid, on one side of the tube, are two
filaments, one a spare. Electrons emitted
by the filament are attracted toward the
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 28)
positive grid at high velocities. So great is
their velocity that many speed by the grid,
are attracted back, still at high speed, and
may pass the grid several times. Some
are immediately collected by the grid,
but many strike atoms and create positive
ions. Ions thus created are attracted to
the negatively charged ion collector
and provide a current indication in the
wire proportional to the numberof ioni-
zations that have occurred. Since the
mathematical probability of an electron
striking an atom in its flight depends
upon the density of the gas, which is in
turn dependent upon pressure, the collec-
tor current is an indication of pressure.
Ions that are created outside the grid
either fall back upon the filament or on
the glass envelope.
The tube is so simple and yet so rugged
in construction, and fills such a vital need,
that it went from its research stage to
production preliminaries at the Westing-
house Lamp Division in about six weeks.
New Rail Power
More than 260 years ago, one Bishop
Wilkins wrote in a book, "Mathematical
Magick," that a gas turbine was suitable
for turning of a split, reeling of yarn, the
chiming of bells, the rocking of a cradle,
and diverse other domestick functions."
We've gone a long way since 1 80!
The first gas turbine-electric powered
locomotive to be built and operated in
the United States has completed its pre-
liminary tests, and is now being tested
further in freight service with the Union
Pacific Railroad.
The huge locomotive, built by General
Electric and the American Locomotive
Company, weighs 500,000 pounds, and is
geared for speeds up to 69 miles per hour.
It's rated at 4500 horsepower, or 53 horse-
power per foot of length, and can tow a
train of 85 loaded freight cars at 65 miles
per hour!
Although railroaders are mighty pleased
with performance of the new locomotive
in its test runs, there's still a great deal of
exploring to be done. If the gas-turbine
electric locomotive has possibilities as a
major factor in railroad motive power, en-
gineers of the General Electric Company
and the American Locomotive Company
will find that out.

FOR YOU
From the very first of this school year, interviewers have been
flocking to this college, looking for engineering graduates. Com-
panies want to hire the best men they can get so they spend a
large amount of time and money in interviewing and investigat-
ing the ability and personality of prospective employees. Scholas-
tic records are examined, of course, but the interviewers are
also very much interested in another type of record—of extra-
curricular activities.
Employers usually feel that students who have taken part in
extra-curricular activities—publications, sports, professional so-
cieties—are likely to be more valuable to the company than those
students who have not taken part. So the active students often
get the first choice of the best jobs.
The lure of the best job should be reason enough for stu-
dents to take an active part in extra-curricular activities; it does,
of itself, attract many men and women to them. But, on look-
ing to the future, there are greater benefits. It is necessary not
only to get a job and keep it, but also to keep forging ahead to
better and better positions.
Before an engineer can be useful to his company, he must be
able to successfully carry responsibilities. No one is naturally
endowed with this ability; it is one which must be developed.
College is the place to develop this ability; almost every sort of
activity places responsibility on the shoulders of its members
Thus the members will leave college better able to carry re-
sponsibility than when they entered. For this reason men who
have been in campus activities are more likely to be more
valuable than those who have not.
Over a long period of time, probably the most far-reaching
effect of activities is the way they help the student develop his
personality. The most important things one secures from col-
lege life and activities are not the precise facts and figures
learned from textbooks, but the character and leadership one de-
velops through his associations and acquaintances. A man can
be a successful scientist and work by himself, but to be a suc-
cessful engineer he must be able to work with others. The
young engineer must sell his ideas and he must "sell himself."
This is true whether his job is on the factory floor or in the
executive offices.
College years are formative years. Personalities develop rapid-
ly during this period. To be successful in activities, as well as in
a real job, it is necessary for one to get along well with one's
associates. How this is done can be learned only by experience.
Now is the time to learn—-incentive is present and yet, if minor
failures occur now and then, they are not so serious as they
may be later. If a student spends all his time in work and al-
lows himself to ignore, his fellows he will be less able to get
along with people after his four years of college than before.
Of a more specific nature is the knowledge and training ob-
tained by students in extra-curricular activities which may be
applied and used immediately upon graduation. The Technic
has had quite a number of its staff members go directly into engi-
neering journals and allied publications and occupations, apply-
ing their experience gained in their extra-curricular activity
directly upon graduation.
Some students who realize the many advantages of participa-
tion in extra-curricular activities still do not enter them. They
feel that they came to college primarily to obtain an education
and the time required by an activity might interfere with that.
The answer to this objection may be found by examining the
ranks of the best scholars; quite frequently they are also the
leaders in campus affairs. Apparently activities have not jeop-
ardized their work.
Activities are in themselves an education: an education in
dealing with people—one of the most valuable, if not the
most valuable, of all education.

64-wheel answer
to a 300-ton question
This mammoth trailer is the first rubber-tired vehicle
ever built to carry a 300-ton payload. Designed for a
special military project, it has Timken* tapered roller
bearings in each of the 64 wheels to help take the
600,000 pound burden. Timken bearings are first
choice with engineers for a job like this, because of
their unusual load-carrying capacity, and because they
give long, trouble-free performance with minimum
maintenance.
Why TIMKEN bearings can
take the toughest loads
In Timken bearings, the load is carried on a line ot
contact between the rollers and races instead of being
concentrated at a single point. Made of Timken fine
alloy steel, the rolls and races are case-carburized to
give a hard, wear-resistant surface with a tough core
to withstand shock.

AUTOMATIC GUN-LAYING
~

Some things man just can't do fast enough — manually. Time was when
gun-pointing information was transmitted to dials and guns were pointed
manually in accordance with the data.
Arma was in the thick of the apparatus development which brought gun
fire control to this point. And, it was Arma who undertook to aim the
guns automatically.
All that was before jet planes were a reality—before supersonic planes
introduced such terms as "Mach 4" into military language. Adapting and
improving the speed of apparatus for the automatic control of anti-aircraft
batteries is one of the important assignments of accelerated engineering
at Arma. It is typical of many ways Arma engineers are aiding in making
America safe against those who wish to destroy it.

SUPREME
SUGAR
REFINERY
equips new plant units with
JENKINS VALVES

There are few tougher proving grounds for valves than
sugar mill service. Sticky, sluggish fluids soon seek
out any weak spots in design and construction.
Over 5200 valves are maintained in regular service by
the Supreme Sugar Refinery of Tallieu, Louisiana. More
installations are continually being made as new plant
additions go up. Long ago the management learned that,
to insure the lasting efficiency required for profitable
operation, the only really safe economy is to choose the
best valves money can buy. For this reason, they
standardized on Jenkins Valves.
In fact, Jenkins Valves have been the consistent
choice of leading engineers, architects, and contractors
everywhere for more and more of the nation's most
notable buildings, wherever cost-wise, future-minded
planning is the rule. For plant expansion, as well as new
plants — large or small; for the commercial and
institutional buildings that dominate today's changing
skylines, Jenkins Valves are providing an extra measure
of dependability, safety, and low maintenance.
Despite this extra value, they pay no more for Jenkins
Valves. The Jenkins Diamond is their guide to
lasting valve economy. Jenkins Bros., 100 Park Avenue,

These Jenkins Valves installed on pipelines serving the pan

OPEN HOUSE
BY
DON V. COUDEN, '51E
Chairman, Central Committee

DON V. COUDEN
Welcome to the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan. Once
again the students and faculty present the Engineering Open House for your
enjoyment and education.
In the past half century the role of the engineer in our society has become in-
creasingly important. His duties, both technical and administrative, have become
more comprehensive and demanding. The engineer can no longer be thought of as
a secluded man in the dim recesses of some dark laboratory. Today men with
engineering training are to be found in abundance at all levels of management.
To meet this challenge and prepare a young man properly for the engineering
profession, colleges have constantly expanded and improved the engineering
curriculum.
It would be difficult, if not impossible, to show and explain to so many visitors
all of the engineering education program. However, the Open House gives you the
opportunity to view some of the activities and facilities which contribute to the
college education of an engineer. Most of what you will see and hear about com-
prises the physical plant associated with the College of Engineering. The labora-
tories and displays present the most spectacular and interesting view of the en-
gineering college, but by no means do they tell all the story.
The University of Michigan, College of Engineering offers courses of study in
nine major branches of engineering. With all these departments and their many sub-
divisions offering displays of their facilities, there should be items to capture the
interest of everyone. The products and activities of engineers have become such
an important part of your life that there are undoubtedly many questions in your
mind concerning these activities. We sincerely hope that the Open House will
answer some of your questions.
Those of you who are high school students and are considering entering the
engineering college, will be interested in observing what type of work each field
entails. One of the primary functions of the Open House is to aid you in selecting
the vocation which best fits your interests and abilities. You should feel free to
ask any question concerning various phases of engineering while visiting our campus.
Many of you will be viewing the Engineering College through the eyes of
a college student whose primary interest is not in engineering. Although you may
have come only to satisfy your curiosity about the individuals who haunt the dark
halls of the engineering buildings, the opportunity now presents itself to broaden
your viewpoint. A tour of the laboratories will give you a fairly comprehensive
outline of the technical activities which the major fields of engineering encompass.
The Open House is by no means entirely for students. Those of you who have
no direct contact with the engineer or his college training will also find many items
of interest in the exposition. In addition to the college laboratories there will be
several displays from industrial concerns which will be of current interest to you.
We wish to thank you for helping to make this year's Engineering Open House
a success by your attendance. We sincerely hope that you have enjoyed the
exposition. The Central Committee would appreciate any suggestions which you feel
would help to make future Open Houses at the University more successful and
enjoyable.

ROBERT E. FRESE, '5IE
The history of the Engineering College
goes back to the original founding of the
University in 1837, when an act passed by
the State Legislature authorized the Uni-
versity and provided for a chair in Civil
Engineering and Drawing. It was not
until 1853, however, that Alexander
Winchell was appointed to teach these
subjects together with Physics. In the
spring of I860 two men left the Michi-
gan campus with engineering degrees. The
University of Michigan thereby became
the sixth institution in the nation to grant
degrees in the field of engineering.
The first courses were taught in the
south wing of University Hall. The fields
of Military, Mining, and Mechanical En-
gineering were included in the curricu-
lum, but by 1872 Civil Engineering was
the only surviving course. In that year
C. E. Greene, Harvard '62, was appointed
a professor. Together with J. B. Davis,
C. S. Dennison, and DeVolson Wood,
Greene laid the foundation for the school.
First Engineering Building
In 1881 a separate building, the Engin-
eering Annex, was constructed. The labo-
ratory equipment consisted mostly of
whatever could be found around campus;
a broken down lathe salvaged from the
basement of University Hall and a used
two horsepower steam engine were in-
cluded. Along with the new building
came the re-establishment of Mechanical
Engineering. The enrollment in engin-
eering increased rapidly. In 1882 the
Michigan Technic was founded. Three
years later the Engineering Annex was
enlarged and even then it proved inade-
quate. In 1889, Electrical Engineering
was added. A dental lab, which stood
on the present site of Clements Library,
was acquired in 1891 and used for en-
gineering courses.
The Engineering College, as a separate
school, was born in 1895, with an enroll-
ment of 331 students. The requirement
for a degree consisted of 120 credit hours
plus a thesis in one of the three courses
offered. The curriculum contained a large
proportion of non-technical courses since
the scope of engineering in those days
was limited. Within four years after the
formation of a separate school of engin-
eering, courses in two more branches of

ROBERT E. FRESE
engineering were started; Chemical En-
gineering and Naval Architecture. Plans
were also made for another, larger build-
ing.
West Engineering Building
Mortimer E. Cooley was made dean in
1903, after the death of Professor Greene.
Dean Cooley held this position for twenty-
five years, during which time his many
and varied services to the institution did
much to make it what it is today. 1904
marked the completion of the West En-
gineering Building, which contained the
second naval tank in the country. The
building was different than it appears
today. It was only half as long, with the
naval tank protruding from the north
end. The Naval tank was built under the
supervision of H. C. Sadler. It played a
prominent part in research and develop-
ment during the First World War. The
Arch over the diagonal was suggested by
Professor Dennison and today the Arch
bears his name.
As the physical size of the school in-
creased, in 1912 the Mentor system was
inaugurated to aid beginning students.
The Honor system was started in 1916
by the Engineering Council, and has been
in effect ever since, except for a short
period during World War II. Aeronau-
tical Engineering was instituted in 1917,
and a course in Geodesy was added in
1922. It was in 1922 also that the De-
partment of Engineering Research was
formed.
As the enrollment in the College in-
creased, every opportunity to obtain
additional teaching space was taken. In
1922 the Tappan School was condemned
by the Department of Education. It was
remodeled and opened as East Hall, which
is still used by the Engineering School
today. The following year the old section
of East Engineering was completed.
The Lawyer—Engineering Feud
It was during these years that the now
mellowed feud between the engineers and
lawyers originated. A large wooden slide
rule, the "lightning calculator", was built
for the Union Opera "Culture". The rule
came to be used every year in the decora-
tions of the Slide Rule Ball. It was in
connection with this dance that the feud
has become famous in the annals of
Michigan. In 1927 the lawyers took the
rule from its customary place a few days
before the night on which both the Slide
Rule Ball and the Crease Ball were to be
held. Needless to say the engineers were
a woeful group the night of the dance
without the symbol of their college. A
year later the engineers were again in
possession of their traditional "wooden
brain". In revenge a party of engineers,
including a few assistant professors, at-
tended the Crease dance and raised havoc
throwing stink bombs as well as shutting
off the electricity. Although the feud
never again reached such a fervor, the
wooden rule once again disappeared from
the Michigan Technic Office just before
the Slide Rule Ball last year. The law-
yers claim that they presented it to Gov-
ernor Williams, and that it now hangs
in the governor's office.
Further Advancements
In 1827 the requirements for gradua-
tion were raised to 130 hours credit and
a thesis. English occupied but four hours
while 16 hours of foreign language were
required.
In 1928 the departments of Mathe-
matics, Engineering Physics and Industrial
Engineering were added. 1928 also
marked the retirement of Dean Cooley.
He was followed by H. C. Sadler, who
had supervised the building of the naval
tank; he held the position for nine years.
During Dean Sadler's reign, Engineering
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



This building, on the site of the Clements Libary, was used by the Engineering
College from 1891 until the present West Engineering Building was built in 1903.
Mechanics, Engineering Law, and Trans-
portation were inaugurated as courses.
Because of illness, Dean Sadler retired in
1937 and Henry Clay Anderson became
Dean. At this time national defense was
becoming important and research work
at the University began to expand. With
the untimely death of Dean Anderson in
the fall of 1939, the reins of the college
were handed to Ivan C. Crawford, our
present dean.
Engine College and the War Period
Dean Crawford successfully put the
College on a war-time basis. The facilities
and staff of the College were able to con-
tribute immeasurably to the war effort.
The National Defense courses integrated
the College with the defense machinery
of the country. Both civilian and service
personnel were trained in courses applic-
able to war. East Quadrangle became a
Military barracks, housing students in
uniform.
When the war ended, the large number
of students, whose education had been
deferred because of military service joined
with the normal number of students en-
tering the College directly from high
school to swell the enrollment to an un-
precedented level. Once again the facili-
ties were overcrowded. An addition to
East Engineering helped allieviate this
condition, and once more the College can
effectively accommodate its enrollment. In
the fifty-six year history of the College
of Engineering, it has always been recog-
nized as one of the leading engineering
institutions in the country. The school is
well known from California to Maine.
Although it is a state supported school,
about half of the students are out of state
residents.
Extracurricular Growth
There is more to the history of the
College of Engineering than its physical
growth and standing among other schools.
A Michigan spirit has also grown. It
exists in the student organizations; the
professional societies, the honorary socie-
ties, and the general societies.
In the pursuit of an education many
students so diligently concentrate on
"book learning" that they entirely over-
look another aspect of education: that of
associating with and learning to know
and appreciate their fellow students. Be-
cause of its growth, the Engineering Col-
lege now offers an excellent opportunity
for this "other side of education", in the
student organizations. These societies
offer programs that are so varied that it
seems likely that at least one should offer
activities that appeal to each engineering
student.
The student chapters of the national
engineering societies offer an opportunity
for the student to meet and hear the lead-
ing men in his field. What these men
have to say concerning engineering sub-
jects should certainly be of benefit to all
listeners. Besides the academic aspect of
these societies, the friends and acquaint-
ances that one makes are likely to be of
much value later on.
These societies are discussed in detail
elsewhere in this issue.
The years ahead appear to be difficult
ones. But we may be confident that the
Michigan men will be well prepared, as
the Michigan men of the past have been,
to assume their roles as leaders in industry
and as good citizens.

ACTIVITIES FOR ENGINEERS
Perhaps the obvious reason a student
enters the College of Engineering is to
obtain the technical education he needs
to become a success in his chosen pro-
fession of engineering.
It does not require much thought, how-
ever, to realize that the engineering stu-
dent must provide himself with many,
many more qualifications if he hopes for
real success in the field. Probably the
most important of these other needs is
his ability to work with, and get along
with, other people. This is the primary
reason for the existance of the many
extra-curricular organizations existing on
the Michigan campus for engineers.
THE ORGANIZATIONS AVAILABLE
TO ENGINEERS
Aiee-lre
The University of Michigan branches
of the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers and the Institute of Radio En-
gineers have been combined into one
organization since 1947. Its purpose is
to increase the students' knowledge of
the practical side of engineering through
lectures, field trips, and other special
programs. Its members meet monthly to
hear guest speakers, see films and demon-
strations, or, on occasion, take field trips
through nearby plants.
This organization also sponsors an an-
nual banquet, a paperwriting contest, a
ten day field trip, and, on the athletic
side, a softball team. All students in
electrical or radio engineering are eligi-
ble for membership.
Armed Forces ROTC Units
Reserved Officer's Training Corps units
are sponsored and conducted by the Army,
Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force.
Some of the courses offered in these pro-
grams are accredited by the University
towards a degree. Besides classroom work,
weekly drill periods are held, six week
training programs conducted, and an
annual all-campus dance, Military Ball, is
sponsored by all the units. Many of
these programs are especially valuable to
the student engineer.
After the student has met the require-
ments of the ROTC program, and has re-
ceived his degree from the University, he
becomes a commissioned officer in a re-
BY
STEPHEN F. LUPE, '53E
serve unit of the branch of service from
which he received training.
Tau Beta Pi
Tau Beta Pi is the national engineering
honor society similar to the literary Phi
Beta Kappa. Although an honorary, it
strives to promote projects and activities
beneficial to engineers and engineering
students. Members are elected on the
basis of their scholastic achievement, ac-
tivities and character. To qualify, one
must meet these requirements and must be
either in the upper eighth of his junior
class or in the upper fifth of his senior
class.
The Michigan chapter performs many
outstanding services for the Engineering
College throughout the year.
Eta Kappa Nu
Eta Kappa Nu, the national honorary
electrical engineering organization since
1904, was founded to aid students and
members of the profession by improving
general standards as well as courses of
instruction. It selects members from both
junior and senior electrical engineering
classes. Meetings are held twice monthly
to acquaint members with others who
have a definite interest in the field.
The local chapter provides free tutorial
service for all students taking electrical
engineering courses.
Pi Tau Sigma
A national honorary society for mechan-
ical and industrial mechanical engineers
is Pi Tau Sigma. Besides the personal
honor and prestige that this organization
offers, it serves to acquaint and unite those
interested in the field. Thus, it encour-
ages research and promotes interest in
subjects and activities related to mech-
anical engineering.
Michigamua
The Tribe of Michigamua is perhaps
one of the most unusual and colorful hon-
oraries on campus. It draws its members,
who must be seniors, from all colleges on
campus. Usually twenty men are chosen
in the spring and five in the fall each
year, among them several outstanding en-
gineers. They are generally men who are
active predominately in all-campus activi-
ties.
Vulcans
The Vulcans is the senior engineering
honorary. Members are chosen on the
basis of both their scholastic and extra-
curricular activities as well as leadership
qualities. Outstanding engineers from
all phases of campus activities, such as
publications, athletics, and student gov-
ernment, are honored yearly with mem-
bership.
A.O.A.
The American Ordnance Association
offers membership to students and faculty
of technical colleges as well as industrial-
ists in this area. Meetings are held month-
ly at the Michigan Union to discuss and
explain latest developments on the design,
maintenance, and production of the
nation's defense weapons.
The A.O.A. provides two monthly
publications for its student members: the
ordnance magazine Common Defense and
the Business Letter which discusses the
latest business trends in our economy.
A.S.C.E.
The American Society of Civil Engin-
eers offers membership to all civil en-
gineering students, except freshmen, with
the purpose of presenting a practical view
of the field to the student. The bi-monthly
meetings offer programs that include guest
speakers, films, and discussions that per-
tain to technical as well as campus prob-
lems concering civil engineering. Occa-
sional field trips to projects such as
highway and sewage, and railway and
bridge construction are sponsored by this
organization.
A.S.M.E.
The American Society of Mechanical
Engineers strives, primarily, to acquaint
the student mechanical engineer with the
practical aspects of the profession. Speak-
ers and demonstrations are included in
the programs of its semi-monthly meetings.
One of the more popular of the society's
activities is the annual essay contest con-
ducted among its members. The better
technical papers are submitted by the
local chapters to their respective regional
contests. Although membership is open
only to mechanical engineering students
above the freshman level, many of the
society's activities are of interest to those
in all phases of engineering.
A.I.Ch.E.
The American Institute of Chemical
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Engineers was founded to acquaint the
chemical engineering student with the
work he will be doing after graduation.
The local chapter was the first student
branch of the organization formed.
The meetings generally include talks
by qualified people in the chemical en-
gineering field. The national organiza-
tion presents a problem during every
school year to be solved by any member
who wishes. The members who offer
correct solutions in the allotted time re-
ceive prizes from the national group.
Field trips are conducted by the local
group to help further the purpose out-
lined by the society.
IAS.
The Institute of Aeronautical Sciences'
student branch offers many benefits to
junior and senior aero students. Unlike
many similar organizations the I.A.S.
attempts to acquaint its members with
the research as well as the practical as-
pect of the field. With this view in
mind, the society presents speakers and
films at meetings besides a Paper Contest,
Banquets with other universities, and
field trips to plants and laboratories.
Membership in this organization pro-
vides the aero student with much desired
general as well as technical viewpoints
of the profession.
Plying Club
Membership in the University Flying
Club is open to any university student re-
gardless of past experience. The purpose
of this organization is to arouse interest
in flying and to encourage students in
flying and other related fields. To accomp-
lish this aim, meetings are held every
two weeks at which time speakers and
films are presented. Many students have
learned to fly at very low cost through the
facilities of the club. The local organiza-
tion is a member of the National Inter-
collegiate Flying Club and actively par-
ticipates in intercollegiate flying meets.
Sigma Rho Tau
Sigma Rho Tau, the engineering speech
society, is designed to help engineers ex-
press themselves orally before public
groups and to encourage speech activities
among engineers.
The local group, established in 1929,
is the mother chapter of the national or-
ganization. Any engineering student who
applies for membership must pass neo-
phyte and novice requirements, and, if
he is qualified, he is given an associate
membership. An associate member may
attain full membership by meeting further
standards.
At the weekly meetings, contests and
debates are held, or exchange speakers
from other chapters are heard. These
meetings add polish to the members'
speaking abilities.
Phi Kappa Phi
Phi Kappa Phi is a national honorary
which chooses members from all schools
and colleges on the basis of achievement
and high scholarship. Juniors, seniors and
graduate students are eligible for mem-
bership.
Sigma Xi
The Society of the Sigma Xi has grown
to be almost wholly an honorary organi-
zation for students both undergraduates
and graduates and faculty denoting their
efforts in research. New members are
elected each spring, and must posses high
scholarship and a record of an aptitude
for research.
Quarterdeck Society
The aim of Quardeck is to promote in-
terest in the field of naval architecture and
marine engineering. Juniors and seniors
may qualify for membership by displaying
active interest in the field as well as
good scholarship. Initiates, chosen by in-
vitation only, must present an extra-cur-
ricular paper concerning naval architec-
ture or marine engineering at the annual
banquet.
Meetings are held every two weeks
where discussions and speakers, prominent
in the field, are heard. Frequent field
trips to various shipyards and testing
sites give the members very practical in-
formation concerning their future pro-
fession.
Triangle
Triangle, a national organization, is
designed to promote extra-curricular ac-
tivities on the campus. Outstanding soph-
omores and juniors, active in campus
functions, are selected for membership.
This organization is unique in that in its
social programs, it strives to bring together
leaders of other campus organizations, as
well as its own members.
S.A.E.
The Society of Automotive Engineers
attempts to acquaint students with promi-
nent men of industry as well as promote
interest in the automotive field. At the
monthly meetings, films, speakers, and
discussions concerning this phase of en-
gineering and typical programs are pre-
sented.
The society extends membership to all
students interested in the field of engin-
eering. Student membership entitles one
to the monthly issue of the SAE Journal
as well as the priviledge of using the
organization placement service.
Chi Epsilon
The local chapter of Chi Epsilon, the"
national civil engineers' honorary, was
established in 1949. Since the founding
date, this organization has promoted
many projects throughout the college;
the most notable being noon movies
which have proved interesting to all en-
gineers.
Members are chosen from among those
junior and senior civil engineering stu-
dents who show an active interest in the
field as well as good scholarship. Mem-
bership in Chi Epsilon offers many oppor-
tunities to broaden viewpoints and gain
general knowledge concerning the pro-
fession.
The Engineering Council
The student government group of the
Engineering College is the Engineering
Council. Eight class representatives plus
delegates from all engineering organiza-
tions compose the membership.
The Councils' main purpose is to co-
ordinate all student activities and organi-
zations in the Engineering College so that
a stronger student body is attained.. To
help achieve this purpose, the Council
schedules many events of interest to the
student engineer. Included are smokers,
picnics, lectures, and mixers. Also, the
Council sells activities cards to all en-
gineering students each year to allow
special discounts on Michigan Technic
subscriptions, Slide Rule Ball tickets, and
other activities.

Men who enter the Engineering College
have started the final preparation for a
profession whose standards must be high.
Civilization looks to the engineer to bring
him the comforts and luxuries of life.
Each new problem presents a combination
of Nature's Laws which must be honestly
analyzed and pieced together. These rules
are real and inviolable. The fact that
various combinations of these basic laws
allow different solutions to the same
problem makes it necessary that the En-
gineer have, in addition to a firm knowl-
edge of fundamentals, a high code of
ethics.
With this in mind, the newcomer is
asked to join with those who have gone
before him to observe, obey, and improve
the underlying principles of the Honor
. Code which will be explained in this
article.
Origination
In 1916, the students of the Engineer-
ing College petitioned the faculty to
adopt some sort of Honor System. This
plan was the result of student thought and
was inaugurated under student control.
The organization and regulation of this
system has never passed from the hands
of the students. The faculty has never
asked for any changes, or in any way
attempted to restrain or control the opera-
tion of our famous system.
Our Honor System is based on the
principle that it is not only dishonorable,
but also detrimental for any man to re-
ceive credit for work which is not the
result of his own effort. Honor is a part
of the code of a gentleman and an en-
gineer, and it is the basis of success here
at Michigan.
In the operation of the Honor System,
there are three main points which should
be observed:
1. It is neither fair nor honest to his
fellow students for a man to receive
aid on a written quiz or examination.
2. The prevention of dishonesty in exam-
inations should be in the hands of the
students rather than the faculty.
3. It is the duty of all students, in fair-
ness to themselves and others, to up-
hold these principles in word and
action.
With the passing years, these principles
have come to include not only examina-
tions and quizes, but also every type of
work done in the Engineering College. It
is, then, a violation of the code to hand
in themes, drawing plates, laboratory man-
uals, or any other work for credit which
is not the product of the person sub-
mitting it.
The actual operation of the Honor
System is contained in the short and sim-
ple phrase: "I have neither given nor re-
ceived aid during this examination." That
is basically all there is to it. However, it
is necessary to expand this statement into
certain regulations to cover any doubt
existing in the mind of any new student.
The procedure is as follows:
1. Every student is required to write
and sign the following pledge after all
examinations and written quizzes: "I
have neither given nor received aid dur-
ing this examination" (signed) John Doe.
Failure to write out or sign the pledge
does not excuse any violation. Members
of the faculty have been asked not to
grade any paper upon which the pledge
is not written out and signed.
2. Upon entering a classroom for an
examination, the students are to take al-
ternate seats whenever possible. This does
not reflect upon the honesty of the class.
It is designed to reduce temptation and to
increase the comfort of each man while
under the strain of an examination.
3. The instructor gives the questions
to the class and leaves the room. Although
he is not required to leave, he usually does
so, always informing the class as to his
whereabouts should anyone desire to ask
a question.
4. Students may take the examination
in any place they so desire, but it is ad-
vised and suggested to stay in the assigned
room to avoid suspicion and to be present
should the instructor desire to make some
announcements.
5. Students may leave the room at any
time, and may talk to anyone at any time
during the examination. No mention
should ever be made of the examination.
Cooperation is Essential
Now since we do not like rules, a most
important item has been purposely left
out of the list above. At any time a stu-
dent sees another student acting suspic-
iously or actually cheating the Honor
Code, it is his duty to speak to the offend-
ing student and ask him politely to re-
frain from any such future practice. A
failure to comply with his request should
be reported to the instructor or to any
member of the honor committee. This is
the most difficult part of the System, for
it takes the greatest determination and is
easy prey for rationalization. Student co-
operation with the Honor Committee is
extremely vital. We must have full co-
operation to make our system successful.
Enforcement
The enforcement of the Honor system
comes from the student body. Each year,
each class elects two men to the En-
gineering Council, the student governing
body of the school. These two and a
chairman chosen from the Council form
the Honor Committee. Meetings are held
when necessary to interview those accused
of violating the Honor Code. After hear-
ing both sides of the case, a report con-
taining the decision and recommendations
is written and turned over to the Faculty
Disciplinary Committee.
This faculty committee reviews the case
with the defendants in the presence of at
least one member of the Student Honor
Committee. These men have the author-
ity to mete out penalties: However, in
every case the faculty disciplinary com-
mittee has followed the recommendations
of the student honor committee. The
decisions are made by the students, and
the penalties are recommended by the
students, but the penalties are imposed
by the Faculty Committee.
The operation of this system to date
has been satisfactory, and we definitely
know that it is much better than the
proctored system, as it is known in most
schools. No system is perfect, and the
Michigan Honor System is no exception.
It shall continue to be successful as long
as we actively want it to be so.
A graduate of the College of Engineer-
ing of the University of Michigan is
known as such throughout his entire pro-
fessional career. Those men who have
gone before us have compiled such a
splendid record of service and loyalty to
the profession that the designation, "a
Michigan Engineer," is looked upon with
great respect the world over. Therefore,
it is our aim to further increase the stand-
ing of our group by making honor a
most important phase of our education.

HOUSE &amp; THE INDUSTRIAL
FAIR
BY
WARREN E. NORQUIST, '53E
Chairman, Industrial Fair
Once again the students of the College of Engineering present the biennial
Engineering Open House—on Friday and Saturday, April 27 and 28.
The feature attractions of the Open House this year are the displays of the
many modern laboratories in the engineering college buildings and the exhibits
of a large number of industrial concerns. &lt;!
To enable each Open House visitor to view all of the many interesting displays,
guided tours will be conducted through each department of the college. On hand
will be both engineering students and faculty to demonstrate and explain the dis-
plays. Programs of the activities during the two days of the Open House will
also be made available.
Presented here below are brief descriptions and explanations of the many attrac-
tions of the 1951 Engineering Open House and Industrial Fair.
This year in connection with the Engineering Open House we are holding an
Industrial Fair. We invited representative manufacturers to send displays for the
Open House Weekend in order to integrate the training of the engineer with
the achievements of the engineering profession. The visiting students and general
public, it was felt, could learn what facilities were available for an education in
engineering and also the applications of that education in industry.
While some of the displays are static displays of the steps in manufacturing a
product, many are working exhibits with equipment in operation and firm represen-
tatives are on hand to explain the operation of the equipment and its uses.
Furthermore in some of the classrooms there will be short movies demonstrating
the applications of engineering to their products. Most of the industrial displays
are located in the halls, classrooms and laboratories of both East and West En-
gineering Buildings. However, the larger displays of equipment such as the civil
engineering displays of road building equipment, the automotive and the ord-
nance displays will be in the surrounding parking lots.
Some of the displays include such items as the packet from the C-119 "flying
boxcar" with a Henry J moving automatically in and out to show how it is'
loaded. In addition there will be on display a Kaiser Traveler, and it might be
interesting to note here that each car sold is registered with Civilian Defense
in case of an emergency where extra ambulance facilities will be necessary. Dis-
plays from Argus and King-Seeley, two Ann Arbor concerns will show the con-
trast in military and civilian production of these two companies. Argus will dis-
play some of its cameras in contrast to some optical fire-control instuments, whereas
King-Seeley will show some of its civilian and military instruments.
In addition to these civilian manufactures' displays the Detroit Tank Arsenal
is sending up a T-46 "General Patton" tank carried in one of the Army's tank
transporters.
APRIL, 1951 15


East Engineering Building, home of
the Electrical Engineering department,
will introduce its visitors to many weird
and fascinating electrical marvels.
Electronics Display
The fourth floor, south wing of the
building, on which are located the elec-
tronics and communication laboratories,
will be the locale for many exhibits ex-
plaining the functioning of A.M. and
F.M. radio, and television. Visitors will
be shown what their voice looks like as
it is transported through the atmosphere
to a radio. An interesting sidelight will
be the sending of voice and music by
means of a beam of light from a flash-
light. A complete radar set will be avail-
able for inspection and the operation of
this device will be explained. The Radio
Club will have in operation its amateur
station W8AXF and visitors will be en-
couraged to broadcast greetings to
W8FSQ, another amateur station with
whom special air contact will be main-
tained.
Power Display
The south wing basement, which ac-
comodates the power laboratories, will
show in operation a representative selec-
tion of electric motors and generators.
One laboratory will feature a motor driv-
ing a genator which in turn drives another
motor. This last motor will be connected
to another generator from which power
will be taken to light a lamp bulb.
On display will be the fabulous Tesla
coil from whose tip will jump six inch
sparks. Electric light bulbs, both incan-
descent and fluorescent, will burn brightly
with no electrical connection when held
near the Tesla coil. Intrepid engineers
will allow sparks from the coil, contain-
ing several thousands of volts, to pass
through their bodies.
The strobotach, a device which makes
fast moving objects appear to stand still,
will be demonstrated. Printed mater,
fastened to a wheel rotating at several
hundred revolutions per minute, will be
read with the aid of this device.
If you've ever been to a carnival you
will perhaps recall the ring and peg game
where rings are to be tossed onto pegs.
A game of this sort will be shown except
that the ring will refuse to stay on the
pegs. If placed on the pegs the rings will
bounce off.

the low-speed wind tunnel located in East Engineering Building.
Also on display will be a remarkable
tin can which when placed on a circular
track will rotate at various speeds with
nothing pushing it.
Aerodynamics Laboratory
In the Aerodynamics Laboratory of the
Department of Aeronautical Engineering
there will be on display several appar-
atuses used for research and demonstra-
tion purposes. All of these apparatuses
will be demonstrated at half hour intervals
during the Engineering Open House.
Low-Speed Wind Tunnel
A low-speed wind tunnel is one of the
fore-runners in the field of small demon-
stration tunnels so common in Engineer-
ing Schools today. The test cross section
is 20" x 30", while an electric driven
propeller generates up to 60 mph test
velocities. Models of aircraft, propeller
blades, airfoil sections, and arbitrary
shapes can be suspended in the tunnel for
force and pressure measurments.
Supersonic Nozzle
A supersonic nozzle used in basic re-
search as well as laboratory instruction
will also be seen. By discharging the
contents of a 100 psi storage tank through
a small nozzle, velocities of 3 x speed of
sound are established in the 1" x 1" test
area for short periods. Pressure devices
and optical Schlieren equipment are avail-
able for recording data on small airfoils
or missile bodies suspended in the test
area. Adjacent photographs illustrate the
shock wave phenomenon which will be
demonstrated during the Engineering
Open House.
Smoke Tunnel
A low-speed smoke tunnel, used in
demonstrating airflow behaviors around
streamlined objects, is also in this Aero-
dynamics Laboratory. Fine jets of fuel
oil vapor are introduced to a stream'of
air, following which the streamlines and
separation of the flow about any object
can be readily viewed.
Fluid Mapper
A Fluid Flow Mapper, used in demon-
strating perfect fluid potential flow pat-
terns, is also on hand. This is a device
using a technique most recently developed
by the research of Prof. A. D. Moore of
the E. E. Dept. Plate models of aerody-
namic shapes are installed between flat
surfaces. A thin film of water is driven
through the resulting space, -while crystals
of P Mn04 cause streamlines in the flow
to be clearly visible. The photographs
shown are samples of those showing the
flow phenomenon which are obtained with
this device.
Large Wind Tunnel
The large wind runnel on the lower
floor of East Engineering is used both by
student classes and by the Engineering Re-

search Institute of the University. Student
classes run tests on models of aircraft
with respect to lift, drag, side force, pitch-
ing moments, rolling moments, and yaw-
ing moments. The Engineering Research
Institute is currently testing wind effects
on advertising billboards such as used for
highway displays. The air pressure is
measured at different points on the sign
and the resultant forces are calculated to
determine applied loads.
The wind tunnel is a double-return type
with a testing cross-section of 64" x 96".
Large windows at the throat of the tunnel
allow photographic recording of condi-
tions and visual supervision of the testing.
The Michigan Experimental Naval Tank
The Experimental Naval Tank in the
West Engineering Building is the second
of its kind to be built in this country.
When built in 1904, the tank was 300
feet long, 22 feet wide at the water sur-
face, and 10 feet deep. Recently, a 60
foot section was added to the length of
the tank. Originally, there were several
features incorporated into the design of
the tank to permit other hydraulic experi-
ments in addition to tank tests of ship
models. The tank was also a reservoir
for the University fire fighting system and
had its pumps located in the nearby hy-
draulics laboratory. Both of these addi-
tional functions were discontinued recent-
ly when the tank underwent an extensive
modernization.
The original car, which weighs 14
short tons and spans the tank, is still in
use, although the dynamometer has had
additions and modifications as required
by experience and specialized tests. Al-
though the car and equipment are set up
for one-man operation, there is ample
deck space for student observers.
The tank has a cross-section area of
about 185 square feet and holds about
500,000 gallons of water. There is a
constant-speed section in the tank 250
feet long with adequate distance at the
ends for acceleration and deceleration. In
the middle of the constant-speed section
of the tank there is a movable false bot-
tom which can be raised or lowered on
threaded rods. When the floor is lowered
its maximum distance of 7 feet, the tank
may be used for deep-water tests. The
bottom, when raised to the water surface,
permits shoal water tests. Because this
false bottom does not extend the full
length of the tank, shoal and deep water
resistances may be obtained on the same
test run. The false bottom does not ex-

tend all the way to the tank sides, thus
permitting the water to circulate around
the edges as the model passes over. A
beach and wave trap installed in the
north end of the tank and extending from
wall to wall reduces the wave reflection
and also catches the spill-over.
During the early years in the history of
the naval tank cheap and easily made
paraffine models were used. Because the
tank water temperature varies between
65 and 77 degrees F., trouble with the
hogging and sagging of the models was
always experienced. This made difficult
the determination of the resistances to a
high degree of accuracy. For the past
number of years, therefore, wood models,
made in the "bread and butter" manner
and finished to templates, have been used
exclusively.
Since it is very difficult to produce tur-
bulent flow over all or nearly all of the
model surface for the accurate prediction
of full-scale resistance, the tank uses a
needle spray so that the required turbulent
flow will be easier to produce. This spray
sufficiently agitates the water surface to
produce the necessary turbulence. To in-
crease the turbulance, a wire is passed
around the underbody of the model at
about one-twentieth the length of the
model from the stem.
The Open House Display
The Experimental Naval Tank will be
open to the public and in operation dur-
ing the Engineering Open House. An
attempt will be made to show visitors the
functions of the tank and its model test-
ing program. A great many models, rang-
ing from barges to sleek yachts to squat
Great Lakes ore freighters, will be on
display under the auspices of the Depart-
ment of Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering and the Tank Director, Prof.
L. A. Baier. The models will portray the
great many different types of hull form
and the evolution of these forms through
the years. The machinery and equipment
used to make the models will be on dis-
play in the adjoining workshop as a com-
ponent of this exhibit. The drawing room
on the third floor will also comprise a
part of the exhibit and there will be a
display of the various drawings that are
necessary in the design of a modern ship.

THE OPEN HOUSE
Following tradition, the students of the
College of Engineering present this year
the biennial Engineering Open House.
The primary objective of this day is to
afford high school students and their in-
structors the opportunity of inspecting
all laboratories of the several engineering
departments, and of physics and chem-
istry. Thus it is an instrument to assist
the student and his counselor in determin-
ing for what vocation the student may
wish to prepare himself during his years
at a university.
Secondly, this exposition permits alum-
ni and other citizens to inspect the
resources of the University in the fields
covered and the alumni to judge whether
or not the College of Engineering is
making progress, as compared with the
days when they were here as students.
The third objective is to enable other
university students to become better
acquainted with the fields covered by the
College of Engineering through inspec-
tion of the laboratories in which the
engineering student spends so much of
his time.
The high school student who comes to
the Open House will, of course, have par-
ticular interest in certain departments, for
instance, the Aeronautical or Electrical
Engineering laboratories, or the Physics
laboratories, may have first claim on his
attention. However, if he is really out to
secure information relative to the several
divisions of the engineering profession,
he should, by all means, give some atten-
tion to every laboratory. The several de-
partments of the College—Electrical, Me-
chanical, Aeronautical, Chemical and Met-
allurgical, Civil, Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering, Engineering Mech-
anics, and Metal Processing—each have
one or more laboratories. In the Depart-
ment of Mechanism and Engineering
18
Drawing, exhibits will be on display and
the drafting rooms open.
In the past three or four years much has
been done to remodel all laboratories and
to bring them up to date.
In Mechanical Engineering, the main
laboratory has been entirely re-designed
and equipped during the past two years.
Civil Engineering possesses new labora-
tories in Sanitary, Structural, and Hy-
draulic Engineering. Aeronautical and
Electrical Engineering each gained several
new laboratories with the completion of
the new wing of East Engineering Build-
ing. The Metal Processing laboratories
have been equipped with the latest ex-
amples of machinery used in the work-
ing of metals. The Naval Tank, one of
the very few connected with an educa-
tional institution in the United States, has
been lengthened. The laboratories of the
Chemical and Metallurgical Department
have long been leaders in the educational
field.
A journey through these laboratories
should be a most interesting experience
for the high school student who is
seeking vocational information and guid-
ance.
We hope that the alumni of the College
of Engineering, particularly, will seize
this opportunity to become more familiar
with the current status of the school. All
like to think of the old-time laboratories
as they were, but progress can only be
measured by comparing those facilities
with the ones now at the command of
students entering the College of Engin-
eering.
In addition to the laboratory exhibits,
the Open House will afford an opportuni-
ty to see many exhibits sent to the campus
by manufacturers of various types of
equipment. These are always interesting
and instructive to everyone.

Engineering Enrollment and Employment
Data recently released by the Office of
Education, Washington, D. C, shows that
the enrollment in 1950 in engineering
schools dropped 18 per cent below that of
1949. According to this report, the two
major factors contributing to the drop-
off in engineering enrollment were a large
•graduating class in 1950 (1126 at the
University of Michigan) and proportion-
ately fewer freshmen were enrolled. This
temporary slackening in the enrollment,
taken together with the draft for military
service, clearly indicates that for the next
seven or eight years the number of young
engineers entering the profession will be
considerably less than the opportunities
awaiting them.
The distribution of enrollment among
the four classes'is interesting, inasmuch
as it shows a larger percentage of seniors
than of freshmen. The figures follow:
Freshmen—24.3%, Sophomores—21.9%,
Juniors—24.3%, Seniors—29.5%. For
many years the freshman engineering class
at the University of Michigan has been
of about the same size as the senior class
because many students transfer to this
College, after having spent one or two
years in junior colleges and in other
schools. The present senior class numbers
many more than the freshmen on account
of the large enrollment of veterans.
Since October of 1950, more than 234
corporations have visited the College of
Engineering, looking for graduating en-
gineers. In addition, many letters of
inquiry are received every day. This year
the graduating class will be relatively
large, perhaps as high as seven or eight
hundred students, many of whom are
G.I.'s and exempt from the draft. Next
year's class will be down to four or five
hundred, and in the following two or
three years the number will probably not
exceed 350.

Plastic "life-savers"
For Coaxial Cable

(ACTUAL SIZE)
In every mile of new eight-unit Bell Telephone co-
axial cable there are over half a million little plastic
insulating discs. They look simple enough—like small
plastic "life-savers"—but there's a lot of engineering
behind them.
In early coaxials, the insulators were made of hard
rubber. But scientists at Bell Telephone Laboratories
found that polyethylene—because of its extremely low
power factor and lower dielectric constant—reduced
shunt losses to about one-twelfth of those with rub-
ber discs.
Use of polyethylene plastic, however, required
the development by Western Electric—manufacturing
unit of the Bell System—of unusual handling tech-
niques and special machinery.
Punching the discs, with a neat hole in the center,
from sheets of the tough plastic is routine. To position
them on the coaxial conductor accurately and speed-
ily is not so simple. Equipment was designed and
built which receives the discs from a hopper, forces
each against a knife edge to slit it, and slips them on
to the wire at regular intervals of one inch. At the
same time another part of the machine forms copper
tape into a tube around the wire and discs, gives a
high voltage test, and wraps the tube with two spiral
layers of steel tape to produce a completed coaxial
unit.
Before the discs go into the machine, they are sub-
jected to an "ozone atmosphere" and to the radiation
from radium salts to remove static electricity which
would cause them to stick together and refuse to enter
the feeding tracks.
All of this — the development of new production
methods and machines, the infinite care in manufac-
ture — requires engineers of many kinds—electrical,
mechanical, chemical, metallurgical, industrial. Work-
ing closely together, they help to convert scientific
developments in communications into economically
manufactured products for the Bell System.

Plastic insulators, fed into this mechanism, are slit — and
pressed on to the coaxial conductor exactly one inch apart.

of the exhibit in the Industrial Exposi-
tion. The visitor to the Department of
Naval Architecture and Marine Engineer-
ing during the Open House will then see
almost every phase of ship design: the
tank test, where the resistances for hull
form and powering are obtained, the
drawing room, where the design work is
done, and finally the model of the com-

Highway Lab
Visitors to the Open House at the Col-
lege of Engineering of the University of
Michigan will have an opportunity to see
just exactly what materials go into the
Michigan state highways. The state high-
way testing laboratory in the basement of
East Engineering Building will be open to
the public so that they may see just how
highway standards are maintained.
The laboratory is divided into six main
divisions: bituminous lab, concrete lab,
cement lab, aggregate lab, chemistry lab,
and soils lab, with a coordinating office
and drafting room upstairs on the first
floor.
The Bituminous Lab
In the bituminous lab such tests as
specific gravity, tensile deformation, flash
point, and viscosity are made upon as-
phalts and tars. The tests are made upon
samples taken at three different stages of

construction of bituminous roads. Samp-
les are taken from the refinery, the tank
car which supplies the material to the
job, and from the final mixture which is
being placed on the road. Sometimes a
fourth sample is taken by cutting a core
from the finished highway. Working with
the first two samples is relatively simple
since the tar or asphalt is in a form ready
to be tested. The material that comes
from the paving plant, however, is mixed
with various aggregates and it must first

be separated into its various components
by means of a centrifuge. After the ma-
terial has been separated, not only is the
tar or asphalt tested, but also the aggre-
gate is tested for proper gradation.
The Concrete Lab
The concrete lab is devoted primarily
to testing cores cut from recently laid con-
crete highways. Within six to twelve
months after concrete pavement is placed,
a core truck goes out and cuts six circular
cores out of various spots in the new
pavement. The holes left are immediately
plugged up with a concrete plug. The
cores are then brought into the lab and
capped with neat cement so that the two
ends will be smooth parallel planes. After
the caps have cured for at least a week,
the cores are compressed to failure in
order to determine the compressive
strength. At the same time, new plugs
are being cast to fill up holes when the
core truck goes out again next year.
The Cement Lab
In the cement lab various tests are run
upon samples taken directly from the
State Highway Department storage silos
located at the various cement plants in the
state. Such tests as slump, compressive
and tensile tests are made upon specimens
made from neat cement and mortar. Neat
cement is a mixture of pure cement and
water, and mortar is neat cement with
some sand added.

Wanted: More Green Thumbs
In a world faced with constant food shortages in so many
countries, more "green thumbs" are needed!
Here in America, modern agricultural methods have in-
creased farm production 60% in the past generation—even
though today there are 20% fewer workers on the farms.
This increased yield means plenty of food for every one
here—and more besides. And the same methods, applied in
other countries, would help answer world food needs.
Better seed, fertilizer, and new scientific methods play
their part. Equally important are the various chemicals that
now fight off blight, disease, and destructive insects. Start-
ing before planting and continuing until the food is ready
for our tables, hundreds of new materials increase and pro-
tect our food supply.
Even after harvest, man-made agents speed the ripening
process. Others guard our food against rodents and insects.
The people of Union Carbide help make possible the
high productivity of America's food producers by supply-
ing chemicals for fungicides and insecticides, gases for rip-
ening and preserving, and the stainless steel so important
in the preparation and distribution of food. If you have a
materials problem, in this field or other fields, it is quite
likely they can help you also.

NINE TIMES THE DISTANCE TO THE MOON. Each year, it is estimated that America uses
approximately 30 billion tin cans (in terms of an average-sized can) to protect food, oil,

and they'd stretch more than nine times the distance to the moon. A goodly percentage

The Aggregate Lab
The aggregate lab is the most versatile
division of the laboratory. Some of the
tests performed in this lab are graduation
and abrasion tests on gravel, compressive
tests on cement blocks, tensile tests on
guard rail cable, tensile and bending tests
on reinforcing steels, and soundness tests
on various aggregate, building blocks,
and stones. The aggregate lab even has
an old brick 'rattier which was used in
the time of brick pavements.
The Chemistry Lab
The chemistry lab tests such products
as salt brine solutions; paints for traffic
signs, equipment, and park benches;
traffic sign reflectors; and even license
plates. The brines are tested to see if
they contain the proper amount of salt,
while the paints are not only tested to
determine if they contain the proper
amounts and types of ingredients but also
to see if they will withstand such things
as bending and weather. The reflectors
and license plates are primarily given tests
tests to determine their resistance to the
ravages of weather.
The Soils Lab
Last but far from least comes the soils
lab. This lab is a direct product of the
work of Professor Housel, since it is
primarily based upon his theories of soil
mechanics. In this lab are run such tests
as compression, shear, and volumetric de-
termination of water content and density.
The most important aspect of this lab is
the correlation that is obtained between
such test data as compression and shear
so that it is possible to predict other im-
measurable qualities of the soil and feel
quite certain that the predictions are
sound.
As can be seen from the above des-
cription, the highway testing lab is ex-
tremely complete and should prove to be
a very interesting part of your tour of the
Engineering Open House.

Hydraulics Laboratory
This laboratory is a facility of the Civil
Engineering Department. Professor E.
Boyce is Chairman of the Department of
Civil Engineering. Professor E. F. Brater
is in charge of the Hydraulics Depart-
ment, and he and Dr. Merkys are respon-
sible for the functioning and improve-
ment of the laboratory.
The lab is used by several Hydraulic
classes which embrace the entire Civil
Engineering enrollment. Regular lab

gages measure strain in structure members.
periods are held in which students are
grouped into various operating capacities
and cooperate in performing one experi-
ment or demonstration with all participat-
ing.
The items of equipment to be displayed
at the Engineering Open House embrace
most of the experiments conducted by the
beginning Hydraulics classes. Several
other items are used in advanced Hydraul-
ics classes.
A 90 degree V-Notch weir will be
operating in series with a Venturi meter,
rectangular flume, critical depth meter
with an accompanying hydraulic jump and
a small sluice gate. Also operating will
be an orifice tank, an elbow meter and
a gate valve meter with an accompanying
piezometer board for indicating the hy-
draulic gradient across the valve. A Rey-
nolds' critical flow apparatus will also be
demonstrated along with equipment for
measuring frictional losses in various size
pipes. Down in the basement of the lab
will be found equipment for determining
characteristic curves for a centrifugal
pump, a large calibrated volumetric meas-
uring tank and the main pump for the
lab's recirculating system. Immediately
above is a large constant head tank and a
weighing tank for measuring discharges
accurately.
In addition to the items mentioned
above, typical student experiment reports
will be displayed along with many inter-
esting devices used to demonstrate the
fundamental principles of hydraulics.
Structural Engineering Exhibits
The civil enginering laboratories, which
are located in Room 154 in the basement
of the north wing of the West Engineer-
ing Bldg., will be open to visitors during
the Engineering Open House. These
laboratories have been developed for
demonstration, testing, and research work
in structural, hydraulics, and sanitary en-
gineering.
During the Open House, visitors to the
structural engineering laboratory will be
able to see several testing and research
activities that are in progress or have been
recently completed. These activities in-
clude research work on a plexiglass model
of a new type of building, an aluminum
model of an unusual roof structure, an
aluminum model of a lock gate for ship
canals, a steel specimen of riveted truss
connections, as well as several other
models and specimens used in structural
research. The demonstrations will not
only illustrate the use of the models but
also the equipment necessary to apply
load and make the necessary strain meas-

Now artists whose names are musical
legend live again for the modern lis-
tener. You can hear them, at their
finest, in RCA Victor's "Treasury of
Immortal Performances."
In recreating these performances on
both 33 and 45 rpm, acoustical engineers
drew on a vault of master records guarded
for posterity by RCA Victor. But new
electronic techniques, developed through
RCA research, give the new records a
quality far surpassing that of the originals.
Because RCA Victor could draw on so vast
a storehouse of the past, there is something
in the 'Treasury of Immortal Performances"
for listeners of every age and taste. Caruso
sings light and serious music—as do Schu-
mann-Heink, Mary Garden, and others . . .

electronic controls.
In addition to these space models a
demonstration of the use of plastic and
metallic models in mechanical methods
of stress analysis will be given in the
small-scale structural models laboratory.
The various gages, micrometers, scales,
and other measuring devices that are nec-
essary for making the tests will also be
exhibited. The actual use of such models
will be described and demonstrated by
various students who are familiar with
the work.

Sanitary Laboratory
The feature attraction of the sanitary
lab will be a complete water treatment
plant in operation including chemical
rlouul.ition, sedimentation and rapid sand
filtration, all of which provide an excel-
lent chance to see just how water is pre-
pared for domestic consumption.
There will be a working model of the
new diatomaceous earth filter which was
used by the army during the war and is
beginning to find a place in civilian oper-
ations.
There will also be a demonstration of
the use of the various chemicals used in
water softening and conditioning as well
as exhibits of the equipment to be found
in a modern water analysis laboratory.
It is planned to have a working model
of a suspended solids water conditioner
to round out the water treatment demon-
strations.
The sanitary engineering lab will pro-
vide Open House visitors with interesting
exhibits of the methods of water purifi-
cation and sewage treatment.

Automotive Laboratory
The center of attraction at the annual
open house to the automobile connoisseur
will be the University of Michigan Auto-
motive Laboratory adjacent to the West
Engineering Annex. There will be found
a representative display of the engines
from new and recent cars. Removed from
the ornate surroundings in which they
are usually found, these engines will be
subject to more critical inspection than
they usually undergo by the motoring
public.
Typical of the engines that will be on
display is the Studebaker engine, which
DISPLAYS
(Continued from page 24)
will be set up on a test stand and
equipped with a high-speed indicator.
This arrangement is suitable for plotting
graphically the pressures within the cylin-
der during the entire cycle of operation.
This high-speed indicator is probably the
best setup of its kind in the United States,
according to Professor Jay A. Bolt of the
Mechanical Engineering Department.
The merits of water-injection can also
be examined in operation, with a new
Oldsmobile Rocket Engine which is one
of the newer high-compression engines.
The "rocket" engine in the lab has an 8
to 1 compression ratio.
Also available for inspection during
the open-house will be a new Nash en-
gine equipped with a glass-covered intake
manifold, which enables the visitor to
examine the fuel-air mixture on its way
from the carburetor to the cylinders.
The new Cadillac high-compression en-
gine is also on display.
The famous maize-and-blue University
of Michigan Automotive lab bus will also
be open for inspection. This bus is com-
pletely instrumented for a road test. Thus,
it is possible to measure to a good degree
of accuracy, the performance of the engine
under actual road conditions.
Those who have wondered how the
octane number of fuel is determined will
be able to examine the CFR (Cooperative
Fuel Research) Engine which is used for
that express purpose. Also on display is
a model of the CFR engine used to obtain
the cetane number of diesel fuels—a value
roughly comparable to the octane number
of gasoline.
In addition to the automotive equip-
ment listed above, there will also be on
display several types of aircraft engines,
notably those types used during the war.
These are the Pratt and Whitney 3000HP
engine, used in the Vaught Corsair and
the Hellcat; the Wright Cyclone engine;
and an Allison and Packard aircraft en-
gine.
From every point of view, a visit to
the Automotive Lab will be one of the
high spots of the day at the Engineering
Open House.
Steam Laboratory
Pi Tau Sigma presents exhibits for the
Engineering Open House in the steam lab
as well as the automotive lab. These ex-
hibits will show the main types of steam,
oil and gasoline equipment with which
mechanical engineers must work.
A display of particular interest should
be found in a jet engine exhibit. A Ger-
man jet engine will be compared with a
Westinghouse type jet and a General
Electric type jet. These engines will not
be running, but will be open for inspec-
tion of the public.

Turbo-Generator in M. E. Laboratory.
To give the interested spectator a birds-
eye-view of the operation of some of the
equipment, a General Electric steam tur-
bine will be run. This turbine is a high
velocity single turbine wheel machine. It
is run through a set of reduction gears to
a generator rated at 18.75 KVA. This
turbine is one of the newest pieces of
equipment found in the steam lab and
gives a good idea of one practical appli-
cation of this relatively new power pro-
ducing method.
There remains but one representative
of the old power producing standby, the
steam engine, in the lab. This is a Uni-
flow steam engine. It is a special type
engine in which there is an extra long
piston stroke, almost twice that of con-
ventional type engines. The Uniflow en-
gine will be set up for testing with a brake
and a cantilever arm attached to the fly
wheel for measuring brake horsepower.
The International Harvester diesel will
also be displayed. The diesel is already
set up with electrical testing panels to
measure the efficiency. This engine has
an interesting feature in that it is started
like a conventional gasoline engine. Gas-
oline is drawn into the cylinders through
a carburetor and fired by spark plugs. As

The hardest material
made by man
is which
of these?
□ Silicon Carbide
□ Tungsten Carbide
D Boron Carbide
□ Carbon Tool Steel
eie^—sej
The answer is Boron Carbide (B4C), pro-
duced by Norton under the trade-mark
NORBIDE*. To make NORBIDE Boron
Carbide, two of the most commonplace
substances — carbon, in the form of
coke, and the familiar household
boric acid — are fused in electric furnaces
at approximately 5000°F, almost twice
the melting point of steel. The result is
the hardest material ever manufactured
commercially — harder, even, than any
natural precious stone except the
diamond!

In the Norton Research Laboratory, William C.
Arthur, B. S. in A. E., Cornell '48, itudiei a problem
in abrasive development.
Unique Properties
Despite its extreme hardness, NORBIDE
Boron Carbide is lighter than aluminum.
Its coefficient of expansion is only about

one-third that of steel, while in molded
form it has high compressive strength —
up to 300,000 lbs per sq in. Although
distinctly non-metallic, it is a fair con-
ductor of electricity, and it has extremely
high resistance to corrosion. Industrially,
one of its most important features is that
it is self-bonding. Under terrific temper-
ature and pressure this material may be
molded — without bonds or cementing
metals — into a homogeneous, dimen-
sionally accurate crystalline body that
may be polished to a hard, smooth sur-
face ideal for many commercial purposes.
Wide Range of Usefulness
The valuable characteristics of NORBIDE
Boron Carbide have provided engineering
departments with solutions to some of
industry's trickiest problems. In pow-
dered form it is used for many abrasive
jobs hitherto possible only with diamond
dust. In molded form it is unrivalled for
resistance to abrasion. NORBIDE gages
and sand-blasting nozzles, for example,
outlast their metal equivalents many
hundreds of times.

warmed up the gasoline is cut off and the
electrical circuit disconnected. Then
diesel oil is injected into the cylinder and
the engine runs as a diesel engine. The
power from this engine is used to turn a
Ready Power Electric plant rated at 30
KW. With this particular set up it is
possible to vary the frequency of the
current produced.
A small engine, but an interesting one
will be found in the hot air engine. This
engine is small enough to be carried
around by one person. There is no fuel
of any type used in this engine. By plac-
ing a fire underneath the cylinder, which
contains no water, it is possible to make
it run continually without any other im-
petus than the heat of the fire. It is a
single cylinder engine with a smaller
cylinder concentric with, but much small-
er than the main one, operating inside of
the main cylinder.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT
Chemical and metallurgical engineers
graduating from Michigan are more for-
tunate than those engineers graduating
with the same degrees from most other
colleges in at least one respect. They
have had the opportunity to use and be-
come familiar with many of the basic
pieces of equipment common to many of
the chemical and metallurgical industries.
The "Unit Op's" or "CM 129" lab is
found on the first, second, and third floors
of the north wing of the East Engineer-
ing Building. Three of the more inter-
esting pieces of equipment will be jcept
running by the CM 129 students during
the Open House so that the visitors may
observe them and ask questions about
their operation and use.
Continuous Drier
At the far end of the laboratory on the
second floor is a continuous rotary drier.
Driers similar to these are used to drive
off liquid, usually water, from damp solids
so that the solids may be dry in prepara-
tion for use. The equipment is said to be
continuous because the damp solids flow
in at a continuous rate and come out dry
at the same rate.
Vacuum Filter
Almost overhead from the drier, on the
third floor, is a continuous rotary vacuum
filter. This is simply a revolving drum
with porous walls. The inside of the drum
is under a vacuum. A mixture of solids
DISPLAYS
(Continued from page 26)
suspended in a liquid, called a "slurry,"
is pumped into a basin in which the drum
is revolving. As the drum turns, the
liquid is sucked into the drum and the
solids are left behind on the drum as a
damp cake. This cake is then scraped off
on a conveyor belt and taken to other
equipment for further processing—usual-
ly drying.
Chem-E Distillery
Of special interest to all ex-home
brewers will be the lab's all-glass bubble
cap distilling column (hie). This column
is located on the second and third floors
on the right as you enter, and is controlled
from the second floor. Distilling columns
are used to separate mixtures of liquids
which have different boiling points. Dur-
ing the open house, the column will be
used to separate alcohol from that unde-
sirable—water; a most interesting process.
ever, one may see the nature of the equip-
ment used through the window in the
door. The other labs will be open for
inspection and the operators will be
pleased to answer questions.
Measurement Lab
The measurements laboratory, located
on the fourth floor of East Engineering
Building, is in almost constant use by the
department. While the laboratory always
welcomes visitors, a special effort will be
made during the Open House to show the
operation and use of the equipment.
Measurement apparatus which can be seen
in operation includes gas analysis equip-
ment, bomb calorimeters, viscosimeters,
gaseous effusion apparatus, vapor-liquid
equilibrium stills, tensiometers, refracto-
meters, phase equilibria apparatus, pH
meters, photo-electric calorimeters, con-
ductiometric measurement apparatus, and

Examination of metal samples with a minocular metallographic microscope.
Plastics, Paints, and Paper
The plastics, paints and paper labora-
tories are located on the third floor at the
far end of the north wing. In the paint
laboratories individual research is being
conducted by graduate students. The
plastics laboratory is now working with
lubricating oils, especially for conducting
tests on paper. Since these tests must be
run under very rigidly controlled condi-
tions of temperature and humidity, the
public is not allowed to go inside; how-
conductance bridges. In the electrical
measurements room, equipment is avail-
able for standardizing potentiometers, cal-
ibrating thermocouples and thermometers,
studying optical and radiation pyrometry,
measuring characteristics of photo cells
and vacuum tubes, and for electrical circuit
trouble-shooting. This equipment is sim-
ilar to that used in industry and finds
daily use in quality control, research,
development, and production.

Natural Gas Synthesis
Increasing demands for natural gas
have aroused considerable interest in the
synthesis of methane from coal gas. To
design the most favorable process requires
a fundamental understanding of the
kinetics of the reaction involved. In two
of the small labs on the fourth floor of
East Engineering, studies are being made
to determine the solid density and surface
area of a solid catalyst and to observe the
variation of the Fische-Tropsh synthesis
for producing methane. The catalyst un-
dergoing study is a nickel catalyst which
has been used to synthesize CH4 from rl,
and either CO or C02. Adsorption of
H2 on the nickel catalyst at constant
temperatures ranging from —195 degrees
Centigrade to 400 degrees Centigrade at
a pressure range of 10-5 millimeters of
mercury to 450 millimeters is also under
study.
Mass Spectrometer
Located next to these labs is a lab con-
taining a mass spectrometer which is used
to analyze gases. This apparatus utilizes
the principle of the differing atomic
weights of the gas molecules. This highly
technical piece of equipment will not be
open to the general public.
The "Packed Tower"
One of the feature attractions of the

chemical engineering labs is located in the
north wing of East Engineering. Stretch-
ing from the first to the fourth floor is
a so-called "packed tower". The function
of this tower is to separate the sulfur iso-
tope from naturally occurring sulfur. In
recent medical research the surfur isotope
of atomic weight 34 has been found to be

useful in resisting the growth of cancerous
tumors. As a result, methods are being
developed to separate this isotope from
the more common sulfur isotope of atomic
weight 32. It is to this end that the
packed tower is employed. The tower con-
sists of a long pipe filled with a packing
that is porous so that liquid can flow
down the pipe and vapors rise upward
through it. The purpose of the packing
is to bring about more contact between
the vapor and the liquid. The vapors are
formed by heating the desired liquid in a
pot called a reboiler at the bottom of the
column.
The sulfur in the form of a sodium sul-
fite solution is added at a continuous
rate to the top of the pipe. It flows down-
ward to the reboiler, in constant contact
with the vapor. Concentrated sulfuric acid
is added to the reboiler which, with the
sodium sulfite, reacts to liberate sulfur
dioxide gas. This is the vapor that rises
through the packed pipe causing the heavy
sulfur dioxide gas, the sulfur dioxide con-
taining sulfur 34, to concentrate near the
bottom of the pipe. The entire length of
the pipe is heated by electricity and is
maintained at a constant temperature of
50 degrees Centigrade. The reboiler, also
heated by electricity, is maintained at a
temperature of 103 degrees Centigrade so
that the sodium sulfite will be kept at

(Continued from page 13)
Radio Club
The Radio Club has been established
to further the interest of those who have
an active interest in amateur radio. The
club operates its own "ham" station,
W8AXZ, in East Engineering Building.
It also operates equipment for code prac-
tice to aid members working for their
licenses. The equipment may be used by
any member provided a licensed operator
is in attendance. Speakers of interest to
amateus radio enthusiasts are presented
at club meetings.
All students interested, whether lic-
ensed or not, are welcome to join.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Now in its seventy-second year, the
Michigan Technic is not only the oldest
publication on the Michigan campus, but
the oldest engineering college magazine
in the country.
The Technic is published for engin-
eering students to report on new and
interesting developments in engineering,
trends affecting engineers as individuals
and as a group, and other subjects of gen-
eral interest to engineering students. The
content of the magazine is not always
technical, but includes many articles on
non-engineering professions and their re-
lation to engineering.
Proof of the high standing of the
Technic is shown by the many awards
it has received from the Engineering Col-
lege Magazines Associated.
The Technic is entirely the product of
undergraduate students in the College of
Engineering, and financially independent
from any other organization. It is not
subsidized in any way and undergoes a
minimum of control from the Engineering
College.
What the Technic Offers the Students
The wide variety of work necessary in
publishing such a magazine gives oppor-
tunity to those interested in selling or
accounting, photography or art work, and
many other fields, as well as writing or
editorial work. Valuable contacts and ex-
perience may be gained by staff members,
as well as enjoyment of the work. A
training program for freshmen is offered
during each semester, and all those who
are interested are invited to try out.

Ever use this ring around your bathtub?
PERHAPS you didn't know that if you
sprinkle a little of a synthetic detergent
in the tub before you draw your bath, you'll
have lots of suds and no dirty ring around
the tub.
Synthetic detergents—as well as aspirin,
nylon, plastics, synthetic rubber and hun-
dreds of other products—are made with
benzene, C«Ht, normally obtained from coal
tar. There's now a demand for benzene such
as has never been before. But production of
benzene from coke ovens cannot be greatly
expanded. So it's easy to see why, even be-
fore the cold war got hotter, it was good
news that Standard Oil and other petroleum
companies could manufacture benzene and
other aromatics from petroleum.
During World War II, Standard Oil made
"nitration grade" toluene for TNT manu-
facturers ... as much annually as the pre-
vious production of all of the nation's coke
ovens. Today, it appears that these faculties
are more urgently needed to help supply the
great demand for benzene. Plans also call
for production of toluene and xylene of suf-
ficient purity for much needed solvents and
for aviation gasoline. Also possible are addi-
tional facilities to again make "nitration
grade" toluene for TNT production when
needed.

DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGICAL
ENGINEERING
The Open House activities of the De-
partment of Metallurgical Engineering
include a wide variety of displays and
demonstrations. These activities are de-
signed to present the different facets of
metallurgy in an interesting and inform-
ative manner. To accomplish this end,
the tours through the Department of
Metallurgical Engineering include stops
at the various labs where displays and
actual demonstrations are used to illus-
trate the principles and practices of
metallurgy.
The first point of interest is the X-ray
laboratory. Here one finds models of the
atomic structures of metals. A demon-
stration is made of the method of deter-
mining the lattice structure and atomic
distance of a metal. The X-ray lab also
offers an illustration of the technique
used in making radiographs of castings,
forgings, and welds, to determine if any
internal flaws are present.
The next display is in the furnace and
heat treating laboratory. The equipment
in this lab is used to investigate the
practices used by industry to obtain de-
sirable properties in the metals which
they use. The displays include combus-
tion and electric furnaces; also molten
metal and salt baths. The surface treating
equipment used for gas carburizing,
cyaniding, and nitriding are shown. One
of the high points of this part of the
tour is a demonstration of induction
heating. In this process a steel bar is
heated to red heat in a matter of seconds
and is then quenched. This demanstra-
tion includes a measurement of the rate
of cooling of the center and surface of
the quenched bar. The changes in mag-
netic properties of steel with changes in
temperature are also illustrated. The
effect of a temperature change on the
atomic distance in steel is measured with
a super-sonic reflectoscope.
The next point of interest is the metal-
lography laboratory. Here one sees the
equipment used for polishing steel to a
mirror finish. Samples of such polished
specimens are put in a metallographic
camera and one can see the greatly mag-
nified structures of various metals.
Finally, the physical properties testing
laboratory contains displays of the various
equipment used by metallurgical engin-
eers in evaluating the properties of
metallic specimens. Here one finds hard-
ness testers, impact machines, fatigue
testing machines, high temperature test
devices, and the magnaflux method of
determining defects in metallic specimens.

METALLURGICAL LABORATORY
The classroom and laboratory facilities
of the north wing of the fourth floor of
the East Engineering building are devoted
to this study and the teaching of engineer-
ing and physical metallurgy, foundry
technology, and various types of physical
and mechanical testing used in the study
of metals.
Basic to the study of metals is the
ability to melt and treat samples at any
desired temperature under various types
of atmospheres. For this purpose many
types and sizes of both gas and electric
resistance furnaces are available which
may be set to maintain and record temper-
atures accurately for long periods without
attention. For operations such as surface
hardening of steel by carburizing or
nitriding, special controlled atmosphere
furnaces may be used.
Foundry Display
The foundry facilities are completely
integrated permitting, in addition to reg-
ular foundry instruction, the production
of castings for University use on a job-
bing basis. A conventional cupola is
regularly used for melting iron to re-
quired specifications for maximum pro-
perties. Induction furnaces for the
melting of small heats of various ferrous
and non-ferrous alloys are in operation as
is a gas fired setting for melting of
brass and bronze.
All necessary equipment for finishing
of castings is present, such as a sand
blast, grinders, snagging wheels, and a
tumbler. Finally, sand-testing apparatus
for controlling sand properties is present.
Structure Testing
Studies relating to the fine structure of
metals are carried out with X-ray diffrac-
tion methods. Two X-ray generating units
are in operation for this purpose. In
conjunction with them are two Geiger-
Muller spectrometers for detecting and
recording diffracted X-ray lines, and a
number of conventional X-ray cameras

The Brains Behind the Electric Brains
How Du Pont Research
engineers apply electronics to
chemical manufacture
When you hear that a scientist works
for a chemical company, it's natural
to assume he is a chemist. Oddly
enough, the Du Pont Company em-
ploys about as many engineers as
chemists for normal technical work.
Many are chemical engineers. But
when it comes to basic research on
instrumentation—a very important
activity—both chemists and chemi-
cal engineers are in the minority.
This fundamental work is largely
carried out in a laboratory of the
Engineering Department, whereelec-
trical engineers, physicists and other
scientists are deeply involved in
electronics studies. They have some
amazing devices to their credit—de-
vices for monitoring industrial opera-
tions continuouslyandautomatically.
Some of their ideas are spurred by
a need in an existing plant. But the
design of a new one may also lean
heavily on novel instruments. Take,
for instance, a new Du Pont plant
that uses cyanides. Of course, these
compounds are very poisonous. So

when the plant was being designed,
engineers were aware of the impor-
tance of detecting accidental contam-
ination of the cooling water. In fact,
the whole question of getting into
production hinged on the problem
of dealing with plant effluents.

tion of a part per million of cyanide

was to raise fish in water containing
plant effluents. But this required a
staff of experts to check constantly
on the health of the fish. It was too
slow and inaccurate. So the engineers
developed a "chemical - electronic
watchdog." Twenty-four hours a
day, it automatically analyzes for
cyanide to one part per million. If an
excessive amount is present, it rings
an alarm bell. Periodically, the ma-
chine pumps cyanide through itself
to be sure it is registering. All the
plant men have to do is take read-
ings occasionally and fill the tanks
with reagents once a week.
This is just one of many electronic
devices developed by Du Pont re-
search engineers. Others—ranging
DID YOU KNOW . . .
While Du Pont is the largest manu-
facturer of diversified chemicals in
the U.S., its share of the total chemi-
cal business is only about seven per
cent. It has one to fifteen major com-
petitors for all its major product lines.

from ultraviolet gas analyzers and
multivariable recorders to nylon
denier gages—play a vital part in
improving production methods.
Many of them not only "observe"
continuously, but automatically cor-
rect anything that goes wrong.
Research engineers at work
The term "research engineer," by
the way, is a loose one. It may refer
to an electronics engineer working
on a new photo-multiplier circuit—
or a physicist using his optics and
spectrophotometry in designing a
color-matching instrument. It may
cover the activities of a physical
chemist developing a continuous
turbidimetric analysis—or a mechan-
ical engineer evaluating a pneumatic
servomechanism.
For the versatile young scientist,
instrumentation research offers a fine
opportunity to turn his talents into
faster, better and safer production
in the chemical industry.

X-ray unit housed in a room completely
lead-lined for protection of personnel. A
complete dark room for X-ray film pro-
cessing is adjacent to the X-ray laboratory.
In order to study the properties of
metals or check the results of heat treat-
ment, it is necessary to know the micro-
scopic structure of such metals. The de-
tails of structure are observed by examin-
ation of the polished and etched metal
surface under magnification. For this
purpose extensive facilities for sample
preparation are at hand. Polishing is done
with the help of coarse and fine grinding
wheels, abrasive papers, and cloth polish-
ing wheels charged with increasingly fine
polishing powders suspended in water.
For certain alloys polishing is more suit-
ably carried out by immersing the sample
in a suitable electrolyte and passing an
electric current through the circuit.
After a satisfactory surface is obtained,
the sample may be examined with micro-

fications and illumination methods. Visual
observation and photographic recording
at magnifications up to 2000 diameters are
possible.
Mechanical Properties
Determinations of mechanical proper-
ties which are of direct engineering im-
portance may also be made. Tension,
compression, torsion, shear, and transverse
tests may conveniently be made on stand-
ard mechanical testing machines. Other
more complex mechanical tests such as
the transverse or rotating beam endurance
test, high temperature creep, sub-zero or
elevated temperature impact are also
possible. Surface and internal flaws in
magnetic metals are revealed by subjecting
them to a strong magnetic field after cov-
ering the surface with a fine magnetic
powder, which is then concentrated along
cracks and sub-surface voids.
A knowledge of hardness is considered
essential in metal technology, and hard-
ness testers based on the principles of
penetration resistance, scratch resistance,
and rebound can be used to determine
this hardness. The penetrator type is the

One-ton window for a supersonic wind tunnel
Just exactly how does a jet plane behave
when it is roaring through the air at super-
sonic speed?
Scientists, peering through windows of
Corning optical glass such as the one you
see here, will soon have a more thorough
answer to this question than ever before.
This piece of optical glass, weighing more
than a ton, is one of two of the largest
pieces of optical glass ever made. They will
be used in the six by six-foot supersonic
wind tunnel of the Ames Aeronautical
Laboratory of The National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics at Moffett
Field, California.
This tunnel generates wind velocities up
to twice the speed of sound, equivalent to
1500 miles per hour at sea level.
* The windows are six inches thick and 52
inches in diameter. They are so clear and
free of imperfections that photographs of
shock-wave and air-flow patterns can be
APRIL, 1951
made through them—to furnish scientific
data of great value in the design of future
airplanes and missiles for supersonic flight.
Until Corning research and glass-making
skill found a way to mass-produce pure
optical glass in large shapes, science had no
suitable substance for wind-tunnel win-
dows. Perfect optical glass with enough
area to permit a full view—and thick
enough to withstand the enormous wind-
tunnel forces—was unheard-of.
Today, Corning can make lens blanks,
directly from the molten glass, ranging in
size from tiny camera lenses to these gi-
gantic windows.
This Coming development is not only
helping to make this country independent
of foreign sources of optical glass; it also
promises many new tools for science, paves
the way for widespread improvement in
products and processes.
Throughout industry, Corning means re-
search in glass-research which has con-
tinually developed new kinds of sjlass and
new uses for existing ones. As Corning has
steadily pushed back the frontiers of glass
knowledge, glass has become a material of
limitless uses.
So we suggest—if you are thinking in terms
of improved products or processes that
you keep glass in mind.

glass, or the many other glasses Corning
makes, simply write us—preferably before

ENGINEERING PHYSICS
The physics department occupies two
buildings. One, West Physics, is used
mainly for classrooms and laboratories for
elementary physics courses. In the other,
Randall Laboratory, are located faculty
offices and nearly all the research labs.
Behind its red brick walls, problems of
nuclear physics, cosmic rays, biology,
spectroscopy, and many other fields are
investigated. The tools used in this in-
vestigation are very complex, some of
them costing over half a million dollars.
Among the tools that will be on display
during open house are the synchrotron,
cyclotron, the electron microscope, and the

scope. The latter, used by doctors and
biologists, employs light to magnify its
images. The electron microscope uses
electrons for that purpose. From the out-
side the electron microscope looks like a
combination of a radio set and a drill
press. It has a magnification so great that
only objects too small to be seen by the
naked eye can be observed with it.
In the physics department there are two
electron microscopes; one is used soJely
for problems that arise in the department
—the other is available to any member
of the university who has a problem suit-
able for its use. The electron microscope
can be used for studying virus, surfaces
of metals, and any other surface which
requires high magnification to be seen.
The Synchrotron and the Cyclotron

ing enable the physicists to obtain the
high energy particles necessary for many
experiments. These are the synchrotron

PROBLEM—You have an aircraft radio receiver.
To operate it, the band selector and tuning elements
must be adjusted. You want to arrange it so that
these adjustments can be made right at the receiver
or from a remote point. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use S.S.White remote
control flexible shafts to connect the tuning dials
on the receiver to tuning cranks on a remote control
unit. This arrangement leaves you free to mount the
control unit anywhere you want, and assures you
of smooth, sensitive tuning from any distance up
to 50 feet or more. The shafts can be readily run
around turns, along walls, under flooring as condi-
tions in different aircraft may require. Any required
degree of sensitivity can be obtained by connecting
the shaft through simple gearing.
This is just one of hundreds of
remote control and power drive
problems to which S.S.White

answer. That's why every engi-
neer should be familiar with the

swing. Every time a push is applied, the swing will gain energy,
provided the push is applied at the correct moment. After sev-
eral pushes the swing has gained a large amount of energy.
The difference between a synchrotron and a cyclotron is the
manner in which the push is administered.
In these instruments, very small particles move in a circular
path and receive a push every time they pass a certain point.
After many pushes, they have attained very large energies.
These high energy particles are used by physicists in many ways.
Elements bombarded by them can be changed into new elements.
Thus the alchemist's dream of changing mercury into gold has
become a reality. Unfortunately this process is very inefficient.
The tremendous energy contained in these particles can be con-
verted into matter and new atomic particles created, or the par-
ticles can be employed to radioactivate any desired element.
Artificially radioactive elements are used in cancer research
and as "tracers" to tag ions and molecules in chemical reactions.
The cyclotron is located in the first basement. It has been
out of operation for several months undergoing an overhaul.
The particles that are accelerated are usually protrons or deu-
terons (heavy hydrogen nuclei). It will give these particles an
energy as high as ten million electron volts. If all the atoms in
one pound of water were given this energy, they would be capa-
ble of lifting a battleship one hundred miles out of the water.

truding upward from it. This tube is used to accelerate
particles to a speed eighty-five percent of that of light. Then

the particles enter the steel dougnut
where they are further accelerated. The
particles usually used are electrons. At
present the synchrotron is not completed.
Other Displays
Several displays are located in the nu-
clear physics laboratory on the second
floor. Among these are the Geiger coun-
ter, a cloud chamber, several gyroscopes,
and an ultrasonic fountain.
A Geiger counter is an instrument that
counts high energy particles passing
through a cylindrical tube. By observing
the rate of particle radiation, it is possi-
ble to determine whether an area is dan-
gerously radioactive or safe for human
habitation. It is also used extensively in
cosmic ray research.
The cloud chamber is another instru-
ment that is useful in acquiring data on
high energy particles. When a particle
passes through the chamber, it leaves be-
hind it a trail of ions. Water droplets
condense around these ions, making the
path visible, although the particle itself
cannot be seen.
Gyroscopes are spinning disks rotating
at high speeds. They resist strongly any
attempt to change their orientation. Be-
cause they will always point in the same
direction once rotation is initiated, they
are used as compasses.
Some of the other displays employ
electromagnetic principles. One of these
consists of a copper ring and and electro-
magnet. When the ring is placed over the
core of the electromagnet, it heats up.
This process is known as induction heat-
ing and is used in industry for the heat
treating of metals. Another display con-
cerns a generator and a light bulb. When
the light bulb is turned on, more force
is needed to turn the crank than when it
is out. This additional energy represents
the heat and light given off by the bulb.
In other words, conservation of energy
still holds; the physicist is no magician
although at times he may appear to be
one. Besides the displays described above,
other interesting exhibits employing
elementary laws of physics will be in
operation.
Fluid Mechanics Laboratory
The Fluid Mechanics Laboratory is
equipped to serve three quite different
purposes: first, as a demonstration labora-
tory for students taking E. M. 4; second,
as a laboratory for the course E. M. 4a;
and third, to provide space and facilities
for experimental research by graduate stu-
dents and the faculty.
As a demonstration laboratory the
equipment here is quite complete and,
in some cases, unique. The laboratory is
equipped to demonstrate ideal fluid flow
phenomena; turbulent flow, using both
air and water as fluid media; and elastic
effects which can be shown by use of the
hydraulic jump analogy and wave analogy.
In addition, many special experiments are
set up in the laboratory which can show
stability of secondary flows and examples
of dynamic similitude.
In the undergraduate laboratory course,
E.M. 4a, a series of experiments are pro-
vided in which the student performs and
studies, in greater detail than in the
regular E.M. 4 demonstrations, the princi-
ples of laminar and turbulent fluid flow
and also applies energy and momentum
considerations to problems in fluid me-
chanics.
Dynamics Laboratory
The Engineering Mechanics Dynamics
Laboratory, located in Room 111, West
Engineering Building, is equipped to
handle all types of dynamics and vibra-
tion problems. Demonstrations will be
set up during the Open House which
will show the basic principles of dynamics
and vibrations. The particular experi-
ments will be chosen to entertain the visi-
tors as well as present fundamental prin-
ciples. Everyone has always been fascin-
ated by the gyroscope; therefore, one of
the demonstrations will be the action of
a box with a gyroscope inside. The box
can be balanced on one corner or on a
wire, and when you try to turn it around it
tries to tip over. Another example that
will entertain the visitor is the transfer
of energy from one body to another. For
this principle, we use two pendulums
suspended near each other and connected
together by a spring. If one is started
swinging, it will cause the second one to
swing by transmitting energy through the
spring. Eventually the first pendulum
will stop moving and the second pendu-
lum has all the energy. At this time the
energy starts to flow back to the first pen-
dulum. This process continues for some
time with first one pendulum swinging
and then the other. A third demonstra-
tion that people enjoy seeing is mechanical
resonance. When a small weight is at-
tached to a spinning wheel, it produces a
centrifugal force which is dependent on
the speed of rotation. If this spinning
wheel is mounted on the end of a steel
beam which is wider than it is thick, we
find this force will cause the end of the
beam to move up and down. When the
speed of rotation of the wheel is the same
as the resonant frequency of the beam,
the motion of the end of the beam is very
large. It is interesting to see that the
small rotating weight causes a larger de-
flection than when a man puts almost his
whole weight on the end of the beam.
The motion of the beam and rotating
weight will be observed by using stro-
scopic light and also by a strain measuring

The participation of the American
Ordnance Association in this year's Engi-
neering Open House is of particular sig-
nificance. Modern war comes with a great
suddenness as we have all seen in Korea.
No longer does a nation have a lengthy
time in which to prepare itself. The con-
flict of the Atomic Age differs greatly
from World Wars I and II in one vital
way: namely, the attack is instantaneous—
a sort of Pearl Harbor and Bikini in one.
The Aims of A.O.A.
The American Ordnance Association
is a national membership society of citi-
zens pledged to the scientific and indus-
trial preparedness for the common de-
fense as one of our Nation's strongest
guarantees of national security and peace.
The Association endeavors to keep alive
an interest in and knowledge of the de-
sign, production, and maintenance of ord-
nance. There is practically no peacetime
industry for the production of ordnance,
and in the advent of a total war, the
industrial might of America will be call-
ed upon to produce items of ordnance in
great quantity and of intricate and un-

It's estimated that during 1951 more than one-third
of G-E production will be for the armed services—to
help fill America's military needs.
For the Air Force, for example, General Electric
builds jet engines, instruments, gunnery systems. For
the Army: such products as radar and equipment for
guided missiles. For the Navy: turbines to propel ships,
electric drive and controls for turning turrets, etc.
For industry, General Electric builds the motors that
drive steel mills, logging mills, printing presses . . .
the electrical equipment for mines and textile mills .. .
the turbine-generators that increase the nation's
supply of electricity.
The hundreds of G-E engineers, physicists, chemists,

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

How to keep a roll neck
from becoming a bottleneck
Bearings in a billet mill have to be rugged to carry
the tremendous separating forces in the rolling of
steel. To insure continuous production and long,
trouble-free performance, engineers specify Timken6
roll neck bearings. That's because Timken balanced
proportion roll neck bearings permit higher roll-
ing speeds, minimize roll neck wear, and have
maximum capacity.
TIMKEN bearings
keep costs low
Tonnage records indicate that Timken bearings
help keep cost per ton of steel rolled to a minimum.
In many mills Timken roll neck bearings are still
going strong after more than two decades of service.
Because of balanced proportion design, they give
greater mill rigidity, permit larger diameter roll necks
than ever before. Roll neck strength is increased
50 to 60%. Load ratings are increased up to 40%.

Refractories
withstands the
Highest
temperature?
If you answered "Stabilized Zirco-
nia*" you're right up to the minute on the
latest developments in the refractory in-
dustry. Norton Fused Stabilized Zir-
conia ... an amazing new refractory ...
withstands temperatures up to 4500°F.
Because it makes higher temperature
ceilings possible, Norton Stabilized Zir-
conia opens the doors to new technical
advances in the processing field . . . has
already speeded up gas synthesis pro-
duction by a profitable margin.
Other Extraordinary
Properties
No other refractory offers such an un-
usual combination of properties. Norton
Stabilized Zirconia has a surprisingly
low thermal conductivity. In spite of the
fact that its specific gravity is twice that
of fire clay brick, its thermal conduc-
tivity is only C (English Units) as com-
pared with fire clay's 12, fused alumina's
20 ± and silicon carbide's 50 + .
Even more amazing is the electrical
resistivity of Norton Fused Stabilized
Zirconia . . . ranging from 2300 ohm-
cm at 1300° F to 0.37 ohm-cm at 4000T.
Yes, it's just the opposite to the usual
rule that resistance increases with the
temperature.
Equally valuable to processing indus-
tries is the chemical stability of Norton
Stabilized Zirconia, manifested in its
ability to resist both oxidizing and reduc-
ing atmospheres at high temperatures
and its chemical inertness in contact
with titanates.
Thinking of Your Future?
First to produce Fused Stabilized
Zirconia in commercially significant quan-
tises. Norton keeps on "making better
products to make other products better"
through constant work on new develop-
ments. To do this requires new ideas and

fresh approaches in the field of research
... a hint to young engineers and chem-
ists. When you think of your future,
think of Norton.

"That's Jonesey—putting out his flag again.
"He hasn't missed one Sunday in the
eight years we've been neighbors. I used
to kid him about it a lot. Asked him
why didn't he buy a cannon to shoot off
with it. He took it good-natured-like.
But we got to talking last week about
war in general. That was the first time
I even knew he had a son.
"His boy, Joe, enlisted right after Pearl
Harbor and got overseas fast. When
young Joe came back, Jonesey met him
at the railroad station, stayed up with
him all night and rode out with him to
the cemetery on the hill. After it was all
over, the sergeant gave Jonesey the flag
that had covered Joe. That's it over there.
I don't kid Jonesey any more.
"Instead, I've been listening respectfully
when he talks about the flag . . . only
when he says it, it's Flag. With a capital
F. Same capital F he puts on Freedom,
which is what he really means. Jonesey
sure made me think about Freedom a lot.
For instance . . .
"When I vote, nobody knows where I
put my X's. Nobody puts me in jail for
picking out my own church. And no
teachers tell my kids to spy on me and
turn me in because I squawk about taxes
or high prices. And when I told my boss
I was quitting to open a litde grocery
with the dough I'd saved in war bonds,
he wished me luck and said he'd have
his missus buy their groceries from me.
"That's what Jonesey meant when he
said our Freedom is right under our
noses. Can't feel it or see it. But it's there
just the same, wrapped up in every star
and stripe in that Flag across the street.
"And, if you'll excuse me, I'm going out-
side and hoist my own Flag, too . . . just
bought it last night. 'Oh say can you see?'

It's difficult to think of a slender match in the same class
with a Block Buster, yet both can be equally destructive.
When a plant is burned out by a carelessly thrown match,
it's just as dead as though it were bombed. Actually,
losses may be even greater, for fire is arch-enemy to
precious machinery and irreplaceable records. That's
why two out of five burned-out businesses never come
back . . .
Yes, it can happen anywhere, for as long as people are
careless there is no way to prevent fires from starting.
But fires can be safely and surely controlled, by checking
fire at the source, when it starts, with Grinnell Automatic
Sprinkler Systems. A record of over seventy years shows
that practically every fire starting in buildings protected
by Grinnell sprinklers was extinguished before doing
material damage.

Research Takes the Long View
Fundamental studies are one

from it have come many products
of commercial significance.
At Du Pont, for instance, funda-
mental research has pointed the way
"products of tomorrow" will come
from the test tubes, flasks and

How fo move mountains—non-stop
When it comes to moving mountains—or spreading the
landscape around—you can't beat bulldozers.
You can, however, beat a bulldozer if you put into it
a part that can't stand the gaff.
An example is the generator. Vibration, abrasive dust,
weather, shifting stresses and stray oils or greases are con-
stantly taking their hardest licks at it. It leads a tough life.
That's why American Bosch Corporation, makers of
dust-proof, heavy-duty generators for industrial tractors
and bulldozers, selected Synthane laminated plastics for
the insulation plate shown above.
Synthane is a material for industry. It possesses an
unusual combination of physical, mechanical, chemical
and electrical properties.
Synthane is light, strong, dense, abrasion resistant. It
is easily machined or produced in formed shapes. Dielec-
trically strong, it is a natural for electrical applications.
Synthane is corrosion and fungus resistant, chemically
inert, stable over a considerable temperature range.
If this capsule description of Synthane piques your
imagination, send for the complete Synthane catalog.

He'd Give His Eye Teeth
For This Opportunity
Lou came out of W. W. II with the bug for electronics.
He'd been an electronics maintenance specialist
in the Navy . . . attended service schools in radar,
sonar and gunfire control to earn his petty officer's
rating. He came to school under the GI Bill...
majored in electronics . . . now has his degree in
electrical engineering. Lou is doing all right now
but wishes he could be closer to his chosen career —
electronics.
Maybe you know Lou—or somebody like him. Perhaps
you yourself have a similar background and can qualify
for this unusual opportunity to secure broad foundational
experience in the rapidly growing field of electronics
engineering.

RAYTHEON GOVERNMENT FIELD ENGINEERING
GOVERNMENT FIELD ENGINEER-
ING is our name for the Raytheon or-
ganization which supplies world-wide
technical service to the Government
relative to the intricate electronic equip-
ment which we manufacture. This highly
qualified group has won an acknowl-
edged eminence among similar organ-
izations. During World War II, Ray-
theon produced more search radar for
the Navy than all other manufacturers
combined. Its Submarine Signal Division
has been the leader in sonar and under-
water sound since 1901.
Since V-j Day, Raytheon has continued
in all phases of electronics development
and production for the Army, Navy and
Air Force, and is now being called upon to
gear its facilities to the growing needs of
the Armed Forces. We now have a lim-
ited number of openings for candidates
who have the special service and educa-
tional background required and who can
meet the rigorous qualifications which
we must impose in order to maintain our
high operating standards.
JUNIOR
FIELD ENGINEER
Successful applicants for the position of
Junior Field Engineer in the Raytheon
Government Field Engineering Organi-
zation will have the same general biog-
raphy as our friend, "Lou". Military ex-
perience with electronic equipment in
the Army, Navy or Air Force is desirable.
A degree from a school of Physics or
Electrical Engineering in a recognized
college or university is essential. Expe-
rience after graduation is of little con-
sequence.
The position of Junior Field Engineer
presents a rare and unusual opportunity
to become acquainted with the most
modern techniques in the science of elec-
tronics. For the graduate engineer, it is a
once-in-a-lifetime chance to familiarize
himself with the many phases of elec-
tronics prior to specialization.
Junior Field Engineers are called upon
to (1) supervise equipment installation,
(2) supervise or personally attend to
its repair and maintenance, (3) train
military or other qualified personnel to
operate, repair or maintain it, and (4)
contribute toward the solution of engi-
neering problems which may arise in
the field. The Junior Field Engineer may
be called upon to undertake important
missions of a classified nature in the in-
terests of the Government. He will at
all times, by the nature of his position,
be a representative of the Raytheon
Manufacturing Company responsible for
sustaining and improving our relation-
ship with and service to the Government.
SALARY AND BENEFITS are liberal,
commensurate with the technical knowl-
edge and skill and the responsibility in-
volved. They include travel and subsist-
ence payments, free accident insurance,
low cost life insurance, retirement and
hospitalization plans. All in all, this adds
up to a job for which only a relatively
small group of engineers can qualify,
but in which successful applicants can
profit more professionally and finan-
cially, can advance more rapidly, and can
acquire a wider range of valuable and
interesting experience than in any other
branch of the industry.
WHO CAN QUALIFY?
Practicing engineers, recent graduates
and those about to graduate are eligible
to apply; preferably those between the
ages of 22 and 30. If you know of a qual-
ified applicant, you will be doing him a
tremendous favor by calling this oppor-
tunity to his attention. All applications
will be carefully considered and held
strickly confidential. Send a brief resume

Why can't this be an
ALUMINUM DIE CASTING?
This challenge was thrown at us by a leading
automobile maker.
"It's possible," we agreed. But . . . the clutch
housing also supports half the engine's weight, it
is highly stressed, must absorb vibration. Could
a die casting economically be made that strong?
An Alcoa Development Program was started.
With the auto maker we drew up designs. We
selected our strongest die casting alloy; poured
sand castings from it; machined it to the dimen-
sions of the die casting design.
Shear static loads and bending stresses were
measured. Brittle lacquer and strain gauges show
us stress concentrations. Castings, engine and
transmission were assembled, then run with an
unbalanced shaft to measure dynamic stresses.
With the auto maker we modified designs. Die
castings were made. We repeated the laboratory
tests while the auto maker made road tests. The
first stressed automotive die casting was a success.
25% stronger in shear, 10% stronger in bending,
100% better in fatigue life than the original
clutch housing. Only M as much weight as
the original cast-iron housing. And 15% lower
in cost.
This case is typical of the engineering problems
Alcoa men undertake and solve. Throughout the
Alcoa organization similar challenging jobs are in
progress now and others are waiting for the men
with the imagineering ability to tackle them.

Dean Ivan C. Crawford will retire at
the end of the current academic year, and
move to Boulder, Colorado, where he will
take up private consulting work. Dean
since 1940, Dr. Crawford has guided the
college through a period of great expan-

1906. After working as a hard rock
miner, steamster, and railroad surveyor,
he entered the University of Colorado
and received the degree of Bachelor of
Science in Civil Engineering in 1912 and
the degree of Civil Engineering in 1915.
The University of Colorado awarded him
an honorary Doctor of Science degree in
1944.
Dr. Crawford became a member of the
University of Colorado faculty in 1912.
In 1916 he joined the Colorado National
Guard and was made a captain. He went
on active duty with the U. S. Army in
1917, serving as a major for 18 months.
Ten of those months were spent in France
in command of a Battalion of Combat
Engineers. Dean Crawford received spec-
ial training in France where he was grad-
uated from the Army School of the Line.
He was honorably discharged, entered the
reserves, and, in 1938, was promoted to
the rank of colonel.
He had risen to the rank of associate
professor of civil engineering at the Uni-
versity of Colorado when he left that
campus in 1923 to become professor and
dean of the College of Engineering at
the University of Idaho. Dean Crawford
remained at Idaho for 14 years and then,
in 1937, became professor of civil engi-
neering and dean of the School of Engi-
neering and Architecture at the University
of Kansas. Then, in 1940, he joined the
University of Michigan as dean of the
College of Engineering and professor of
civil engineering.
In addition to his teaching and adminis-
trative duties, Dean Crawford has had a
considerable amount of practical experi-
ence. Prior to entering the University of
Colorado, he worked two years in metal
mining and for three years was instrument
man and inspector engineer with various
western railroads. He served one year as
transit man and concrete inspector on a
large dam and for two years helped work
on The Structural Engineering Handbook.
While at the University of Colorado he
was, for two years, in charge of commer-
cial testing work.
He was chief of the General Building
Section of the Belgian Mission, American
Peace Commission, and while at the Uni-
versity of Idaho was in charge of the ma-
terials testing laboratory of the Idaho
Department of Public Works. He was on
leave for two years, 1933-34, to act as
state engineer for Idaho under the Federal
Emergency Administration of Public
Works, and was Idaho's representative, in
1934, on the U. S. Coast and Geodetics
Survey.
Dean Crawford served as an associate
consultant of the drainage basin studies
on the Columbia River under the Natural
Resources Committee in 1936. During the
war he was consultant on training pro-
grams of the Army's Ornance Depart-
ment and of the Navy Department Bu-
reau of Navy Personnel. In the latter
capacity he wrote the bulletin setting up
the wartime Navy V-12 courses. As an
advisor to the Defense Department in
1949, Dean Crawford made studies and
recommendations concerning the curricu-
lums at West Point and Annapolis.
Societies of which he is a member in-
clude Tau Beta Pi, Vulcans, Sigma Xi,
Sigma Tau, Alpha Sigma Phi, and Acacia.
He is a member of the American Society
of Civil Engineers, of which he was di-
rector from 1935 to 1938, the Society of
American Military Engineers, the North-
west Scientific Society, the Society for
Promotion of Engineering Education, and
the Masonic lodge.
Last year, Dean Crawford received the
Norlin Award from the University of
Colorado, made each year to an outstand-
ing alumnus of that university. The year
1950 also brought him a fellowship in
the Academy of Engineering from the
American Society of Industrial Engineers,
in recognition of his contributions to the
industrial arts and sciences, especially
in connection with the educational activi-
ties and training of professional engineers.
During Dean Crawford's tenure many
physical additions have been made to the
physical plant of the college. The biggest
single addition came when the new wing
of the East Engineering Building was
completed. The Electrical Engineering
Department then moved from the base-
ment of West Engineering into the new
wing of East Engineering. The single
common electrical machine room was re-
placed by many new laboratories: three
AC machine and two DC machine labora-
tories, a photometric laboratory, a dyna-
mometer laboratory, and the communi-
cations and electronics laboratories.
The Aeronautical Engineering Depart-
ment also moved into the East Engineer-
ing addition. The department now boasts
two subsonic windtunnels, a supersonic
jet, and instrumentation, structures, and
propulsion laboratories.
In the space formerly occupied by the
Electrical Engineering laboratory the Civil
Engineering Department has established
sanitary, hydraulic, and structures and
structural models laboratories. At Willow
Run, the lakes laboratory for harbor de-
sign has been set up. The State Highway
Materials Laboratory in the basement of
East Engineering Building has been en-
larged as has the civil engineer's summer
school at Camp Davis, Wyoming.
The Department of Metal Processing's
foundry has been modernized and is now
the most completely equipped university
foundry in the United States. The heat
treating and welding laboratories have
been almost completely replaced and
greatly enlarged; the machine tool labora-
tory has been completely renovated and
now has equipment valued at over a mil-
lion dollars. The measuring and gauging
laboratory has also been greatly enlarged.
The naval tank of the Naval Architec-
ture and Marine Engineering Department
recently has been lengthened, increasing
the available testing length by one-third.
The naval tank is the largest college-
owned naval tank in the United States.
At present the Mechanical Engineering
Department is in the midst of a rehabili-
tation program; several large turbines and
air conditioning test equipment have al-
ready been installed.
The Chemical and Metallurgical Engi-
neering Department has recently install-
ed a spectroscopy laboratory and has en-
larged the Sohma precision measurements
laboratory. X-ray and metallographic lab-
oratories have been added and several
high temperature testing laboratories have
been constructed.
Thus we see that the years of Dean
Crawford's administration have been the
years of great expansion in the physical
plant of the College of Engineering.

A revolutionary new streamliner, the
first of its type ever to be built in this
country, was recently completed by the
American Car and Foundry Company
plant in Berwick, Pennsylvania. This train
is the first of three to be built by ACF
based on the Spanish Talgo patent, the
other two to be used for regular passen-
ger service in Spain on the 400-mile run
between Madrid and the French border.
The first "ACF-Talgo" was built for test-
ing and demonstration use in this country
so was built to the 4 feet 8l/^-inch guage
track used in the Western hemisphere,
while the remaining pair will be built to
the 5-feet, 6-inch European guage. The
trains will each be about 370 feet long
and will consist of a Diesel-electric loco-
motive, a baggage unit, and three coaches,
the last of which will feature an observa-
tion lounge. The design of these coaches
is unique in that each coach consists of
four connected passenger units and one
equipment unit, each of which has only
two wheels, located at the rear of each
unit. The front of each unit is supported
by a special type of coupling on the rear
of the preceding unit, the first unit being
supported by the locomotive which is of
conventional type. The central unit of
each coach is the equipment unit and con-
tains the entrance doors and the various
facilities such as the air conditioning,
control lockers, washrooms, and kitchen-
ettes for serving light meals.
Each coach, with the exception of the
observation coach, is 100 feet long and
seats 64 passengers. The observation
coach, containing the lounge unit, is seven
feet longer and seats an additional 16
passengers.
The Talgo Principles
To understand the reasons for the de-
velopment of the radically designed Tal-
go, we must first examine some of the
problems involved in the operation of
high speed trains. A train rounding a
curve at high speed obviously has a tre-
mendous centrifugal force tending to
cause it to overturn. Railroads must, with
their present type of equipment, meet
this problem by restricting the speeds
allowed on various turns to remain within
a safe range. It is a common occurrence
for streamliners to attain speeds of 80
mph or better only to have the brakes

between the locomotive and the passenger-carrying units.
applied to slow for a curve. This repeated
acceleration and deceleration causes not
only an increase in transportation time
but also a tremendous loss in economy of
operation since power is wasted by fre-
quent braking and regaining of speed.
The Talgo reduces the effects of cen-
trifugal force by considerably lowering
the center of gravity. In the Talgo the
center of gravity is at approximately the
same height as the points of suspension,
about two feet lower than in standard
equipment in use today. This enables the
train to negotiate curves at higher speeds
with less tendency to leave the tracks or
overturn.
Another problem in the operation of
high speed trains is that of wheel flange
friction and angle attack. When on a
straight track, the wheels on the train are
rotating in the same vertical plane as the
rails so there is little or no friction be-
tween the wheel flanges and the rail
heads. In a curve, however, the flanges
dig into the rails, the flange on the for-
ward part of the wheel rubbing against
the rail with a downward motion and
tending to lift the car and cause it to
climb the rails.
In the Talgo this positive angle of at-
tack is eliminated by the three point ge-
ometry of the underframe which leads the
wheels around the curve like a trailer
behind a truck-tractor. Each unit, as it
goes into a turn, is turned inward slight-
ly by the preceding unit which is already
well into the curve. This slight inward
angle gives the wheels a negative angle
of attack, pulling the leading edge of the
flange away from the real and thus elim-
inating the friction at that point. On
sharper curves or at higher speeds the
trailing edge of the flange sets up a fric-
tion with the rail head which actually has
a tendency to pull the car down onto the
rails more firmly, thus eliminating any
tendency to leave the rails due to centri-
fugal force. The leading unit, the Diesel
locomotive, is of conventional design in
that it has the same four wheel suspension
used on present line equipment but its
center of gravity is considerably lower,
enabling it to take the curves at higher
speeds in spite of the usual flange fric-
tion there.
The Talgo Suspension
In standard railway equipment the cen-
ter of gravity of the cars is several feet
above the point of suspension where the
weight of the car is transferred to the
trucks. In a condition such as this the car
will obviously have a tendency to lean
outward on a curve like an inverted pen-
dulum.
The Talgo is suspended on two stub
axles, one on each side of the car, in
much the same manner as the front sus-

pension of an automobile. This suspen-
sion is carried up the sides of the coach
by heavy coil springs to a point about 40
inches above the rails. This suspension
point is actually 22 inches above the floor
of the car since the floor is placed between
the two stub axles. This places the center
of gravity of the car at approximately the
same height as the suspension points thus
eliminating any tendency for the car to
lean outward in a curve. This also in-
creases the comfort of the passengers by
overcoming to a certain extent the passen-
ger's own centrifugal force.
Design Promotes Economy
The Talgo design is much lighter than
conventional trains due not only to the
decrease in the amount of material used
in construction, especially in the under-
carriage, but also to the use of light
aluminum alloys to a much greater degree
than has previously been attempted. The
weight of five Talgo units (four passen-
ger units and one equipment unit) is less
than one fourth that of a standard coach
and has approximately the same carrying
capacity. This reduction of weight per-
mits a saving in both the initial and oper-
ating costs of the motive power. The use
of separate equipment units also results in
greater economy due to the removal of
complicated apparatus from underneath
the cars where access is difficult.
Another economy of the Talgo is a
direct result of its lower silhouette. The
locomotive is only twelve feet high, two
feet lower than the standard Diesel, re-
sulting in a reduced frontal area and con-
sequently offering 14 per cent less wind
resistance. This is an important factor at
speeds of 60 mph or better since above
that speed wind resistance increases in
proportion to the square of the speed.
It is in this range, the high speed range,
that the standard Diesel is least efficient
and weakest. Therefore the Talgo loco-
motive cannot only reach high speeds
faster but can maintain them more easily
and economically.
Construction of Coaches
Each ACF-Talgo unit is 20 feet, 2 inch-
es long and 10 feet, 4 inches wide. The
backbone of each unit is a "U" shaped
center sill, an extruded aluminum alloy
section five and one half inches deep, to
which crossbearers, floor beams, etc. are
fastened.
An unusual feature of the construction
of the Talgo coaches is the fact that the
frames for each side and the correspond-
ing half of the roof are made in one
hydraulically pressed section and are
joined at the center line of the roof. At
the lower edge of the sides the frames are
joined to an aluminum channel section
running the full length of the unit and
attaching the frames rigidly to the floor
crossbearers. The sides are covered with
flat sheet aluminum while the roof is
made of beaded aluminum alloy sheets.
The ends of the units are Plymetl
where partitions are required, the ends
being left open to form a continuous
coach in all other cases. Two heavy dia-
phragms are placed between all units to
form a smooth interior and exterior and
to provide weather protection. These dia-
phragms are closed by means of special
zippers fitted with overlapping sealing
lips which will hold through any degree
of tension set up in a curve. These dia-
phragms pressure-proof the enclosure and
form a dead air space for insulating pur-
poses.
Couplings, Running Gear, and Brakes
The Talgo coupling system is much
simpler and less expensive than the heavy
couplers and draft gear usually found on
railroad equipment. It actually consists of
two separate coupling systems, one pri-
marily to carry the vertical load placed on
it by the unit behind and the other to
carry the horizontal pulling thrust, each
so designed, however, that it is capable of
carrying out both jobs in the event of the
failure of the other coupling until the
train can be brought to a stop.
The horizontal thrust couplings consist
of a simple connection with horizontal
and vertical pins through each end of the
car to provide for tension. In an emer-
gency this coupling will pivot on its pin
connections and carry the entire vertical
load of the front of the next car. The
vertical load is normally carried by load
bearers located 32 inches above the head
of the rail. These load bearers are of the
pin and socket variety, with two heavy
pins located at the rear of each unit fit-
ting into corresponding sockets in the
front of the trailing unit. These coup-
lings also act as roll-preventing devices
and complete a four point suspension sys-
tem even though there are only two
wheels per unit. These vertical load
bearers are fitted with a circular slot and
key arrangements so that they will pro-
vide for horizontal tension in an emer-
gency. As an additional safety factor,
two steel safety cables are attached be-
tween each pair of units and are capable
of both pulling and supporting the train
behind a break until it can be brought to
a stop.
As has been previously mentioned, each
unit is fitted with only two wheels. These
wheels are specially designed and are of
a built-up, welded construction, differing
from ordinary railway wheels in that the
core of each is resilently connected to a
steel tire by means of a rubber sandwich-
like bushing which diminishes running

We have received several letters from
people about a problem which appeared
in a previous issue of the Technic and
therefore we will devote a portion of
this article to a discussion of that prob-
lem.
The problem, briefly restated, is this—
We have twelve coins of which one is
known to be counterfeit. We are informed
that the counterfeit coin has a different
weight than the genuine coins but we do
not know whether it is lighter or heavier.
By means of a simple balance we are to
detect the counterfeit in three trials.
We can solve this problem in this
manner. Divide the twelve coins into
three groups each containing four coins.
Designate these groups as groups A, B,
and C.
For the first step balance group A
against group B. There are two possible
consequences. Either the two groups will
balance or they will not balance. Assume
they balance. Then group C must con-
tain the counterfeit. Balance three coins
from group C against three good coins. If
the balance is true then the fourth coin is
the counterfeit. If the balance is not true,
then we know the counterfeit is among
the three group C coins and also we know
whether the counterfeit is lighter or heav-
ier than a good coin. By balancing one of
the three group C coins against another
of the three we determine the counterfeit.
We must now consider the case where
groups A and B do not balance. In this
event all the group C coins are good. We
note that one of the groups, say A, is
heavier than the other. For a second bal-
ance we place two group A coins and
two group B coins on one side of the
scale and on the other side we place one
group B and three group C coins. If the
balance is true we check the two group A
coins that were not used against each
other. Either one is counterfeit and heav-
ier than the other or else the group B coin
not used is the counterfeit. If the balance
is not true we note which side is heavier.
If the side containing the two group A
coins is heavier, then one of these two
coins is the counterfeit and heavier or else
the single group B coin on the other side
is the counterfeit. Which coin it is can be
determined in a third balance. If, how-
MURRAY H. MILLER, Grad.
ever, on the second balance the side con-
taining the single group B coin is heavier
then the counterfeit must be one of the
two group B coins on the other side.
Again a third balance will determine the
counterfeit.
There are several other solutions to this
problem but, in principal, they are simi-
lar to the one given above.
Here is a problem that we think we
will cause quite a lot of difficulty al-
though actually is no problem at all. Three
girls were sitting in a restaurant each eat-
ing three sandwiches when they finished
and went to the cashier to pay for the
meal, one of the girls discovered that she
had no money with her. The other two
girls therefore split the check between
them, one paying for three sandwiches
and the other for six sandwiches. Later
the forgetful girl handed her friends
ninety-nine cents to cover her share of
the check. Now how should the ninety-
nine cents be divided among her friends.
We remarked in a previous issue about
the daughter of a friend of our who pre-
sented us with some arithmetic problems.
Well, she has come up with another one
for us and we are passing it on to you.
The problem is to supply numbers for the
letters that have been substituted.

We know a card trick of sorts that can
be made into a problem. Supposing we
number the cards in each suit of a bridge
deck as one to thirteen counting the ace
as one. We now make three card stacks
in such a manner that the number of the
card on the bottom of the stack plus the
number of cards in the stack is fourteen.
After making the three stacks we count
the number of remaining cards. This will
always turn out to be ten more than the
sum of the three cards on the bottom of
each stack. Now the question we are
asking is why is this so.
On a certain island somewhere there
live two very peculiar types of people.
These two types are alike in every respect
except one. One type always speaks the
truth and the other type always lies. With
this background we would like to tell
you of an incident which occurred when
we visited this island. To quench a
thirst which we had developed we wished
to drink from a stream which ran across
the island. In order to determine of the
water was fit to drink we asked three na-
tives who were standing nearby. Each said
the water was fit to drink. However, re-
membering the peculiarities of the natives
we asked one of the three whether or not
he was a liar. The native mumbled some-
thing we could not understand and then
fled. We then asked the other two natives
what the third had said. One replied that
he had said he was a liar and the other
replied that he had said he was truthful.
Upon hearing these replies we were
able to determine which of the two na-
tives we could trust for truthful replies.
We will leave it up to you to determine
how we were able to do so.
As a last problem we will see if you
have imagination. Suppose we had a
checkerboard. Such a board has, of course,
sixty-four squares. On a square in one
corner of the board we place a pebble.
On the adjacent square we place two
pebbles. On the next we placed four
pebbles. We continue this proceedure of
doubling the number of pebbles we put
on the board each time we move to a
new square until we have reached the
last square. Now, without doing any cal-
culating, try to guess at the order of
magnitude of the number of pebbles on
the checkerboard. Is it a thousand, a
hundred thousand, a million, or what?
We'll give odds that you'll be off by a
factor of more than ten.

ARMA ELECTRICAL RESOLVER

ARMA
CORPORAT
Making important things little is a militarily vital objective of the acceler-
ated engineering activity which characterizes Arma. Making them little
and interchangeable and more accurate ... all at the same time.
An example of advancing miniaturizing accomplishment is the new lighter,
more accurate and interchangeable Arma electrical rcsolver. This is one
of the computing components that replaced a formidable aggregation of
gears, bearings and slides previously used in fire-control equipment to
solve the trigonometric functions. It is the "thinking" mechanism in modern
military instrumentation which solves such gun-laying equations as a=c
sin Ac cos B instantaneously.
The mechanical resolvers of World War II have since given way to the
electrical. Application of the new miniature Arma electrical resolvers to
the needs of all the Services is widening as rapidly as accelerted engi-
neering can'push it. This is another way Arma engineers work to help
make America safe against those who wish to destroy it.

SENIORS TAKE NOTE
Santa Monica, parent plant of Doug-
las Aircraft Company, is only a few miles
from Hollywood, but Douglas talent
scouts operate in a far different manner
than their screenland counterparts.
In fact, Clayton C. LaVene, manager
of engineering employment in the big
Pacific coast airplane factory, says his
problem in interviewing applicants for
jobs is not to see how well they can act,
but to catch them in the act of not acting!
"All intelligent applicants for jobs put
on an act," he said, "and only when they
revert to normal is it possible to estimate
correctly their capabilities. They usually
greet me with a prepared speech or at
the very least a prepared attitude reflect-
ing the student's idea of what we'd like
to see in a junior engineer.
"Very often, it isn't at all what we
want, and only by persistent questioning
can we determine the applicant is good
material, despite his assumed disguise."
LaVene said he expected this year to
double or triple his "catch" of engineer-
ing graduates—he signed up 450 in 1950
—by making more recruitment trips and
taking with him three assistants so more
students can be interviewed at the 40 or
50 accredited colleges and universities he
will visit.
Engineering school deans will be ad-
vised in advance of LaVene's visits. They
usually cooperate, he said, by passing the
word to their senior and graduate stu-
dents.
"Before examining the applicants," the
Douglas talent scout said, "we prefer to
address them en masse and tell them what
it means to help design and make air-
planes. We advise them of employment
conditions at various Douglas plants
scattered around the country, so we need
not lose time examining applicants who
don't want to leave home."
Although there are more than 250 en-
gineering specialties classified by profes-
sional societies, approximately 70 per cent
of the men LaVene will hire will be
assigned to work requiring knowledge of
mathematics, aerodynamics, mechanics,
properties of materials, metallography of
light alloys, airplane structures, vibra-
tions, fluid flow, therodynamics or internal
combustion engines. Juniors, however,
usually are required oniy to solve specific -
ally assigned problems by standard meth-
ods and apply advanced theory only after
detailed explanation by a more experi-
enced worker.
Of the 350,000 graduate engineers in
the United States, only 15,000 or about
4 per cent are aeronautical engineers. This
is regarded as a low ratio for an industry
depending so heavily on rapid develop-
ment, advanced design and original re-
search.
It is believed, however, that the
$9,000,000,000 of government funds for
aircraft and related procurement will pro-
vide swift expansion for engineering as
well as for other branches of the indus-
try.
GLASS-METAL SEAL
General Electric Company engineers
can solder glass to metal in a process
which makes a bond stronger than the
glass itself.
The method, which can also be used to
solder metal to ceramics and carbon, was
originated by scientists of the G-E Re-
search Laboratory, and is currently being
tested for industrial applications by the
company's General Engineering Labora-
tory.
The glass and metal areas to be sold-
ered are painted with a thin layer of
titanium hydride, and solder is placed
upon both painted areas. The parts are
placed together and then heated under a
vacuum.
When the temperature reaches about
900° Fahrenheit, the titanium hydride de-
composes. This causes the holder, which
has already become molten, to adhere to
the titanium-painted areas of both the
glass and metal. A strong, tight bond is
formed upon cooling, according to the
engineers.
By using soft metal solders, it is possi-
ble to subject this glass-to-metal seal to
rapid temperature changes without danger
of cracking, despite the wide difference in
temperature expansions between glass and
metal. This is possible because the differ-
ences in movement are absorbed by the
solder, the engineers explained.
The new technique is now in use in air-
craft ignition systems, and laboratory in-
vestigations have suggested possible appli-
cations in the manufacture of transform-
ers, capacitors, and electric motors. These
possibilities are now under consideration,
according to laboratory engineers.
U. S. FACING SERIOUS TECHNICAL
MANPOWER SHORTAGE, ENGI-
NEERING EXECUTIVE DECLARES
American industry is facing a technical
manpower shortage that threatens to be-
come critical in the near future. The
warning was made by H. N. Muller, Jr.,
of Pittsburgh, Pa., assistant to the en-
gineering vice-president of Westinghouse
Electric Corporation, during an address to
the Southeastern Electric Exchange meet-
ing at St. Petersburg, Fla. The Westing-
house executive declared:
"We should frown severely on any
policy that allows our young men in en-
gineering colleges to enlist in the military
in droves, just out of panic. It has to
become perfectly clear to our people that
dissipation of trained manpower, if it
continues, comprises a real threat to na-
tional security."
For the first time in history, Mr. Muller
explained, America is faced with the possi-
bility of war against an adversary of vast-
ly superior numbers. Pondering the ques-
tion, "can we win against such a foe?
the answer is that we can, but only if
our men are used more effectively—in
addition to tactical superiority. Maximum
utilization of technical brainpower and
the products it conceives is the only way
to win against sheer numbers. Some of
this brainpower must be in the military,
but an even larger share must be in nec-
essary civilian pursuits."
Mr. Muller pointed to figures showing
the diminishing number of engineering
graduates expected to be available to enter
industry in the next several years.
During the past two years, he said,
U. S. engineering schools graduated ap-
proximately 50,000 young men each year
and this tremendous number was assim-
ilated by industry very rapidly. Even last
summer, however, a shortage was becom-
ing apparent. Through 1950, the man-
power needs created by World War II,
plus the industrial expansion since the
war, had not yet been completely satisfied.
"Now, in 1951, we are going to have
about 32,500 new graduates added to our
technical reservoir," the speaker declared.
"We know that this figure is not enough,
as is evidenced by the scramble for men on
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


It is not uncommon to meet an engineer-
ing senior walking around with five or six
job offers in his pocket.
"Looking beyond 1951," he continued,
"we run head-long into a more serious
situation. According to estimates from
the United States Office of Education, in
1952 the number of graduates will decline
to 25,000; by 1953 to 20,000; and by the
year 1954, statistics indicate a maximum
of 17,000 engineering graduates ....
The shortage of engineers—a cumulative
total of 105,500—becomes a very clear
and very serious situation when analyzed
in the light of such figures. It will be
even more acute, since our figures assume
that none of these men will enter the
military—a condition that obviously won't
happen."
Efforts are being made to plug the
technical manpower gap, Mr. Muller re-
ported. The Engineers Joint Council
Manpower Commission is undertaking a
long-range program of factual publicity
directed at the high school principals,
counselors, students and parents. In ad-
dition, he added, the experienced engin-
eers of industry, and engineering man-
agement, can help by counseling high
school seniors, and by explaining the op-
portunities for the man who today chooses
a technical career.
The Westinghouse executive said in-
dustry also must help by providing a flex-
ible program of orientation and training
for its young engineers and by making
sure its engineers are "doing engineer-
ing."
"Examine your organization," he told
his listeners, "and see if some of your
trained engineers are doing work that
can be assigned to supporting personnel.
If the answer is affirmative, we urge you
to rectify that situation promptly."
NEW HIGH SPEED OPTICAL
INSPECTION METHODS TO
SAVE MANPOWER
Newly-developed methods in inspection
by optical projection have made greater
inspection speeds and accuracy possible at
lower cost.
A simple production part may require
as many as 20 gages for its inspection,
each inspection operation requiring a sep-
arate inspector. In optical projection in-
spection an image of the part—magnified
from 10 to 100 times—is thrown onto a
screen and a single inspector quickly
checks it against an accurate, magnified-
scale chart of its outline.
New projection methods using 1000-
watt lamps have made the enlarged image
of the part clear and distinct even in
natural daylight. Other advances have
come from chart forms which instantly
indicate the high and low limits and
whether the part is within tolerance.
forms two other functions. It sends out a
stream of pulses which stabilize the cam-
era and can be used also to issue vocal
instructions to the cameraman.

PORTABLE TV CAMERA-
TRANSMITTER
A new portable television camera and
transmitting station, designed to operate
in the field as a one-man back-pack unit,
was demonstrated by L. E. Flory, of the
RCA Laboratories, at a recent meeting of
the Institute of Radio Engineers in The
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
Weighing only 53 pounds, the pack-
pack station is planned to function with
its own battery-power supply. It has a
range of approximately one mile. Be-
cause of its easy portability, numerous
applications for the new equipment are
foreseen. Among these are news cover-
age, with television-equipped reporters
flashing pictures and commentary direct-
ly to editorial rooms, and remote indus-
trial viewing and control.
The new transmitter operates in con-
junction with a control station which may
be located as far as a mile from the
camera. Signals corresponding to the
scene being televised are transmitted to
the control point on an ultra-high fre-
quency with a power of two watts. In
addition to acting as a monitor for the
televised picture, the control point per-
component parts made possible the im-
pressive reduction in bulk and weight of
the equipment.
The back-pack is carried in knapsack
fashion, suspended from the narrator's
shoulders by flexible straps. Two small
antennas extend from the top of the pack
and are used respectively to transmit the
picture signal to a base station and to re-
ceive voice and control signals from that
same point.
The camera is an adaptation of the
RCA industrial TV camera using the
Vidicon tube. As an added feature, the
camera includes a miniature kinescope pic-
ture tube which serves as a view-finder
for the cameraman. Through it he is able
to see an exact reproduction of the scene
on which the camera lens is focused.
The equipment contains 42 tubes which,
with their associated circuits, provide all
synchronizing frequencies for a standard
525-line, 30-frame interlaced television
picture. Included in the unit are the bat-
tery-operated power supply, deflecting cir-
cuits, amplifiers, and a radio receiver for
receiving instruction and other essential
information from the control point. A

BY
ROBERT E. FRESE, '51E
By the time an Engineering student
finishes his freshman year in college, he
is well versed in the basic operations of a
slide rule. He chuckles at multiplication
and division on the C and D scales and
smiles as he includes a trig function or a
square root in a continuous operation. In
his next three years in college he gains
facility in using the Q scale and learns
a few easy tricks which increase his speed
and accuracy in working specific types of
problems. In this article the writer pre-
sents many of the easy tricks so that each
reader may profit by learning and using
those with which he is now unfamiliar.
Take out your slide rule, a piece of paper
and a pencil and follow along.
The Difference of Two Squares
Every engineer knows that (A2 — B*)
can be factored into (A —B) and
(A-f-B). This fact is a handy tool in
evaluating the difference of two squares,
especially when A and B are nearly
equal. Suppose that in a problem we find
that A is 63.4 and B is 56.1. If we square
each on the slide rule and take the differ-
ence we find the answer to be 860. If,
however, we had taken the product of
the two factors, 7.3 and 119.5, we would
have obtained 872 as the answer. The long
hand solution is 872.35. In this problem
the third significant figures of the squares
of A and B were equiva'ent to only the
second significant figure of the answer.
By multiplying the two factors on the
slide rule, we can read the answer to three
significant figures.
Difference of Two Close Fractions
Error creeps into another operation in
a similar way. Take for example the prob-
lem of evaluating
(58.70/35.20) - (43.00/27.30).
If we perform the division first, we must
then subtract the two slide rule obtained
quotients, 1.578 from 1.669, and be satis-
fied with an inaccurate answer, 0.091 in
this case. We might attack the problem
by changing the original problem into an
expression with a common denominator.
This leads to a subtraction in the numer-
ator, and unfortunately, the numbers are
nearly equal. Following through we obtain
90 961 which equals 0.0936, which does
not closely agree with the first answer.

ROBERT E. FRESE
If we desire a more accurate answer to
this problem, with only a slide rule at our
disposal, we must resort to a slightly
longer procedure. Remember one proper-
ty of a fraction which states: any quanti-
ty may be added to the denominator of
a fraction provided, the same quantity
multiplied by the fraction is added to the
numerator? Let us add 7.90 to the de-
nominator of our second fraction and
7.90 times the fraction to the numerator.
This changes our problem to
(58.70/35.20) — (55.43/35.20)
We now have a common denominator.
One numerator is exactly as given and
only a portion of the second one is a
result of a slide operation. Performing
the subtraction and then the division we
obtain an answer of 0.0926, which com-
pares favorably with the long hand an-
swer of 0.09252.
In the sample problem the denomin-
ators of both fractions were of the same
order of magnitude. It may be necessary
at times to multiply or divide one frac-
tion by 2, 5, 10 or some like number be-
fore proceeding with the first step.
Division by a Number Near a Power of
Ten
The property of fractions mentioned
above can also be used to advantage when
dividing by a number near a power of ten,
or by a simple multiple of such a num-
ber, when four place accuracy is desired.
Take for example the fraction 1296/31.-
14. Dividing the numerator and denomin-
ator by three we obtain 432/10.38. Then
by substracting 0.38 from the denominator
and subtracting 0.38(432/10.38) from
the numerator we obtain 416.2/10 or
41.62. In doing this operation you might
notice that another place could have been
estimated giving an answer of 41.618.
Slide rule accuracy can be obtained on
this type of problem while doing the
problem mentally. If the denominator is
sufficiently close to a power of ten, the
quantity to be subtracted from or added to
the numerator can be estimated mentally.
In our example here, we may say that
0.38(432/10.38) approximately equals
0.4(400/10) or 16.0, giving us an answer
of 41.6. The operation is just as quick as
using your slide rule if you have to reach
for it and take it out of its case. Make
up a few examples and try them out your-
self.
Binominal Expansion
An entire article could be written on
the use of the binomial expansion in per-
forming simple operations. Let us limit
ourselves here to a few examples which
can easily be remembered. If the first
term of the binomial is unity the expan-
sion can be written:
nX n(n-l)X2
(1 + X)« = 1 +—+ 2 + • •
If X is much less than one, the first two
terms of the expansion are sufficient for
slide rule accuracy. Using the expansion
wc can solve quickly, sometimes mentally,
the following examples.
(1.024)'&lt; = 1 + 0.012 = 1.012
(0.984) V' — 1 — 0.008 = 0.992
(1.024)-"' = 1 — 0.012 = 0.988
(2.024)!'= 1.414(1 — 0.006) = 1.422
(1.024) V = 1 + 0.036 = 1.036
The reader, with a little more investiga-
tion will find numerous uses for this
method.
Square Roof of Sum of Two Squares
Probably the most useful of the meth-
ods presented here, is the one to be dis-
cussed now. In evaluating the square
root of the sum of two squares the entire
operation can be pel formed on the slide
rule. It is necessary that the tangent and

Bad News for Bugs
Bugs are in for the surprise of their lives. They're going to
zoom into allethrin, the new insecticide ingredient. It looks
like especially bad news for many of the insects that pester
you most.
Take flies, mosquitoes and gnats . . . allethrin's paralyz-
ing touch searches them out... delivers the blow that knocks
them down fast. . . leaving its slower acting companion in-
gredients in the spray or powder to complete the kill.
Until now this tvpe of insecticide came from flowers
picked by the natives in Asia and Africa. But allethrin is an
all-American product, synthesized under scientific controls
and has the definite advantages over importations of uni-
formity in strength and quality.
It is only natural that the people of Union Carbide pio-
neered in the production of allethrin on a commercial scale.
For they were already making most of the needed chemical
ingredients.
As a result, the people of Union Carbide are already pro-
viding allethrin in ever-increasing quantities to manufac-
turers of household and dairy sprays. And researchers all
over the country are now engaged in testing its value for
the control of agricultural pests and for other purposes.
Other Union Carbide chemicals are important ingredients
in many other insecticides and fungicides. One or more of
them may have a place in your future plans.

BY
J. W. SHAW, P.E.
Chief Smoke Inspector
Dept. of Building &amp; Safety Engineering, City of Detroit
Added stimulus has been given to
smoke abatement activities since the un-
fortunate incident in Donora, Pa., where
eighteen persons died as a result of air
pollution. This was neither the first nor
the last episode of this nature to occur.
In the winter of 1930 sixty-three persons
and many animals died, while hundreds
were ill, in the Meuse Valley near Liege.
The meterorological conditions there at
that time were almost identical to those
in Donora on October 30, 1948. Just
recently twenty-two people died and three
hundred and twenty were hospitalized in
Mexico. But in contrast to the Meuse
Valley and Donora episodes, the lethal
gas (hydrogen sulfide) and its source
were easily identified.
These unfortunate catastrophes have
precipitated accelerated activity by various
commercial pressure groups to "feather
their nests" in promoting their panaceas
under the guise of offering assistance to
smoke abatement programs. This pub-
licity has misled many people to the opin-
ion that smoke abatement was a new
boondoggling endeavor. That is entirely
false. England has had smoke control
measures, reportedly, since the early 14th
century, and the first ordinances for the
control of smoke were reportedly passed
in this country in 1881.
The logical question is: Why do we
continue to have "smoke-palls" in our
large industrial centers hundreds of years
after control measures have been adopted
to abate air pollution? The answer to this
question is not as simple as many of the
professional propagandists would have us
believe. Contrary to many of their state-
ments, the major air-pollution problem in
most of our large industrial centers is
smoke and fly-ash and not the wearing off
of the rubber from tires and heels. It must
be recognized that to meet public de-
mands for clean air requires large finan-
cial expenditures and vigorous, competent,
and extensive administrative effort by the
enforcement agencies to control this smoke
and fly-ash.
Definitions
There have been various definitions of
smoke, fly-ash, and air pollution, and the
terms are often used interchangeably, as
I purposely have done up to now in this
paper, but I personally feel that for the
purpose of unanimity we should have
special technical definitions upon which
all interested in this field could agree.
The following definitions are only for the
purpose of clarity in the remainder of this
paper, but I sincerely hope that at the
next convention of the Air Pollution and
Smoke Prevention Association of America
this subject will be discussed for the same
purpose.
1. Air Pollution: Any undesired gas-
borne matter emitted to the atmos-
phere. Examples: Smoke, fly-ash,
dusts, noxious gases, fumes, mists.
2. Smoke: Observable gas-borne amor-
phous carbon created by the heating
of hydrocarbons in the absence of
sufficient oxygen. Characteristics:
soft, will smudge when handled;
shade dependent on particle size and
concentration; contains very little
mineral matter.
3. Fly-Ash; Ash capable of being gas-
borne; may have some carbon; usu-
ally created by the combustion of
solid fuel containing minerals.
4. Noxious Gases: Any undesired gas
or mixture of gases.
5. Mist: Gas-borne liquid droplets.
6. Dusts: Particulate material capable
of being gas-borne.
Louis C. McCabe in his paper "Smoke
Prevention Trends in the U.S.A." present-
ed at the Air Pollution Symposium at
Pasadena in November, 1949, gives a
clear and frank picture that is revealing
and informative to anyone interested in
air pollution studies.
In this fine paper, under the caption of
"folklore", he states: "There is current
the statement that for a long time the
onus for atmospheric pollution was put
on smoke—more specifically coal smoke
.... [that] these theories have long
since been exploded [and that] the idea
that coal is the principal culprit is no
longer seriously advanced . . . .' The
realization that fumes and dust cause seri-
ous air pollution is not new. Almost forty
years ago, Aitkin described the role of
sulphur dioxide in the formation of early
morning fogs over the industrial cities of
Great Britain, and he in 1880, and Owens
in 1926, demonstrated the preponderantly
greater amount of dust in city than in
country air. The prevalance of smog in
cities that do not burn coal in no way
minimizes the smoke nuisance where it
exists."
Pittsburgh Plan
During the afternoon of February 9,
1951, the city of Pittsburgh, Pa., had an
atmospheric inversion. There is no doubt
in the minds of us who were in the city
at that time that smoke was the atmos-
pheric pollutant that filtered out the rays
of the sun and entered our nostrils and
eyes.
National magazines and news services
have featured articles and pictures stating
that this phenomenon could no longer
occur here. Does this indicate that the
Pittsburgh Smoke Abatement Program is
a failure? No, anyone familiar with
smoke abatement work cannot view the
numerous stacks that no longer spew black
smoke into the atmosphere and not real-
ize that there is an active smoke abatement
program in Pittsburgh. We talked to a
cab driver who admitted that this con-
dition occurred infrequently now, but
previous to their air pollution program
now in force, the incident we were view-
ing was typical much of the time, es-
pecially during the month of February.
Misinformation
I recently heard a statement that the
reason paint becomes discolored is that
the paint is not composed of the proper
ingredients. You no doubt have read that
the meteorological conditions cause smogs.
A news article recently published reported
an overfire air-jet that will burn fly-ash.
These half-truths do not clear the atmos-

This, as if you didn't know, is a slide rule.
sine scales be on the sliding portion of
the rule.
The method is as follows: Place the
index (beginning or end of the sine
scale) over the larger of the two num-
bers on the D scale and place the hair
line over the smaller of the two numbers
on the D scale. Read the angle on the
tangent scale under the hair line. Move
the sliding portion of the rule (not the
indicator) until you read the same angle
under the hair line on the sine scale. The
answer is now under the index, on the D
scale.
Let's try an example. Suppose we wish
to find the square root of the sum of 24-
and 72. The large number is 24, so place
the left hand index over 24 on the D
scale. Place the hair line over 7 on the
D scale. The angle under the hair line
on the tangent scale is 16.27 degrees.
Move the sliding portion of the rule until
you read 16.27 degrees under the hair
line on the sine scale. The answer appears
under the left hand index, 25.
This method is easily extended to
square root of the sum of more than two
squares, by taking first two of the num-
bers, then using the answer in combina-
tion with the third number, and so on
until all the numbers have been used. It
is advisable to choose the largest of the
numbers as one of the starting pair so
that shifting indices will be kept to a
minimum. Let us find the square root of
the sum of 32 + 12- + 42. The largest
number is 12 so we will place that number
under the left hand index. Placing the
hairline over 3 we proceed with the oper-
ation and find our partial answer to be
12.37. We now leave 12.37 under the
index and place the hair line over 4. Pro-
ceeding with the operation we find our
final answer to be 13.

(A* + B2) ^ = A + B/3
The equation (A^-fB8) » = A + B/3
is very rapid, fairly accurate approximation
for B less than or equal to A. The graph
of the error involved is shown in Fig. 1.
If greater accuracy is desired and a slide
rule is not handy, a rough sketch of the
error curve such as that shown in Fig. 2,
will suffice to correct the answer to within
one and a half percent. Let us take an
example. 125* + 72- is approximately
equal to 125 -f- 24 or 149. From Fig. 1
we note that our answer is percent three
high. If a more exact answer is desired
we note that 72/125 is approximately 0.6.
Referring to our rough sketch (Fig. 2) we
estimate the error to be four percent. We
compute four percent of 149 and subtract
it from 149 to obtain as our answer,
143.0.
This method is extremely valuable to
electrical engineers, without using the cor-
rection procedure, to obtain a quick ap-
proximation of impedance when resistance
and reactance in a series circuit are known.

Computing Spuare Roots
One method of finding square roots
when a slide rule is not handy is shown
in the following paragraph. The proced-
ure is not as laborious as it might seem.
With a little practice it becomes a useful
tool.
The method makes use of a formula:
b
c = a + —
2a
Let C be the number whose square root,
c, we desire, "a" is the closest convenient
square root that we know. Then b = C
— a2. The word convenient is used be-
cause if "a" is chosen such that "2a"
consists of an integer less than ten, then
the quotient b/2a can be formed mentally.
The method should become clear with
just one example.
We wish to find the square root of
1642. The nearest convenient square root
is 40, whose square is 1600. Therefore
c equals 40 + 42/80 or 40.5.
An example involving slightly more
work would be to find the square root
of 1260. This number is bracketed be-
tween 900 and 1600. Let us see what
answers we obtain by using both of these
values for a2. Using 900, c equals 30
plus 360/60 or 36.0. Using 1600, c
equals 40 minus 340/80 or 35.75. So we
see that even if a number is about half
way between two known, convenient
squares, the answers obtained agree with-
in about one percent. In this case we
might have computed the square of 35 on
scratch paper and found it to be 1225.
Using that value for C we find that c
equals 35 plus 35/70 or 35.5.
Graph of the error involved in setting (A- H
B2)'' equal to A + B/3. Note that the maxi-
mum error is approximately five and a half per-
cent.

Your first job is the most important
job in the world. Picking that first
job carefully can mean the difference be-
tween a running start in a really satisfying
life work and merely working for a living.
You must have been giving this problem a
lot of thought as you look toward the end
of your scholastic career. I had exactly
the same problem while I was working for
my E. E. at North Carolina State in 1925.
I happen to think that the man who
applies his company's product in the field
is the most important man in the American
business system. Not only does he help
create the demand that keeps our fac-
tories working, he is also the force behind
many of the great improvements in prod-
ucts and processes which have been made.
He must know and understand the cus-
tomer's problems and the factory's facili-
ties, then bring the two together to pro-
duce better goods at lower cost.
I knew I wanted this kind of work. Most
of all, I wanted to be free to try several
fields of work; to find out where my
talents lay; to see where my individual
effort would bring the greatest satisfac-
tion.
Allis-Chalmers Serves All Industry
I chose the Allis-Chalmers Graduate
Training Course because Allis-Chalmers
has a hand in solving the problems of
every basic industry .. . food, steel, min-
ing, aluminum, electric utilities, public
works, chemicals, and many others. Here
I saw my chance to find out which I
wanted to work in.
Taking the course in many different
departments, I learned as much as I could
about as many products and industries as
I could. Then I began application engi-
And I found the work that has made me
happy.

courses and may alter them whenever you
like. You choose among electric power
generation, distribution and utilization

basic industry equipment for processing
cement and rock products, ores, wood,

equipment. You can get actual practice
in design, manufacturing, sales, research,
administration, service anderection before
choosing which one to follow. And many
Allis-Chalmers customers have openings
for training course graduates.
As I've said, I believe the most impor-

July first of this year will mark the
completion of my eleventh year as dean
of the College of Engineering. This anni-
versary and retirement date furnishes a
proper opportunity to express a thought
or two that have been on my mind for
some time; and, also, to set forth a few
statistics. The latter I shall present first.
Statistics
Hurried preparations for war were
evident in the summer of 1940, prepara-
tions which should have been started at
a much earlier date. The enrollment in
the College was 2250 undergraduate and
225 graduate students. Of the undergrad-
uates, approximately 50 per cent came
from outside the state. In the military
and industrial worlds engineers were at
a premium, as they are now. The War
came and the College, although badly
handicapped by lack of space and obso-
lete equipment, became one of the most
active in the nation in war training pro-
grams. Both the Navy and Army estab-
lished professional engineering curricula
in the College and sent thousands here
for training. Technician training for the
armed services brought other thousands
for brief periods.
Following the war period, the enroll-
ment jumped to 3900 undergraduate and
over 500 graduate students. This condi-
tion continued until within the past year,
bringing with it gargantuan problems of
crowding in classrooms, laboratories, and
the procurement of additional experienced
teachers.
Over the years, since its founding,
approximately 15,600 students have left
the College of Engineering with bachelor
degrees. Thirty-eight per cent of these
degrees have been granted in the period
1940-50; as many were granted in this
comparatively brief period as were hand-
ed-out in the first twenty-five years of the
century.
The College has been mass-producing
engineers since the conclusion of War II.
This has been a fulfillment of its duty to
our returning soldiers. With this year,
the enrollment has dropped to a pre-war
figure.
The addition to East Engineering Build-
ing in 1947 partially relieved the space
problem. Efficient, modern laboratories
were secured for electrical and aeronau-
tical engineering; civil engineering se-
cured laboratories in hydraulics and in
the sanitary and structural subdivisions—
a notable event because the department
had possessed no laboratories, except the
one shared with the highway department,
since 1912; the mechanical laboratories
were completely renovated.
These years have been years of crises.
For each crisis the faculty, with student
cooperation, has found a temporary ans-
wer at least, one within the physical limits
imposed by space and budget.
The Future
It is quite clear that excessive enroll-
ments militate against the intimacy that
should exist between teacher and student.
With larger classes comes the consequent
result that the instructor has less time for
each student. The same undesirable situ-
ation exists when the instructor carries an
excess of consulting work or research in
addition to teaching duties.
All schools that have experienced large
increases in enrollment realize that with
this increase they have lost something. In
the first place, the students themselves are
not well acquainted with their classmates.
It is rather difficult for one member of a
class to become acquainted with a fraction
of the thousand or more that make up the
class in his college, let alone the three or
four thousand that graduate each year
from the entire university. Unless care-
fully organized, with enough faculty mem-
bers to keep classes down to a reasonable
size, the school becomes merely a place
where the student secures a technical edu-
cation and a diploma; the human side of
education is squeezed out.
Michigan is one of the larger engineer-
ing schools of the country. All signs
point to a continuance of this position,
although the enrollment has dropped

fifty per cent below the post-war high.
This drop should assist in restoring the
intimacy which, to a large degree, took
flight with increasing size, especially dur-
ing the post-war years.
Student professional organizations and
other student activities of the College will
provide the opportunities for acquaint-
anceship.
Facilities such as well-equipped labora-
tories and attractive and comfortable class-
rooms play a most important part in the
education process. Some ground has been
gained in this respect, but considerable
remains to be done if the school is to
maintain its position in engineering edu-
cation.
Michigan possesses an enviable reputa-
tion in engineering. This position has
been gained as the result of efforts on the
part of the faculty, alumni and students.
In the past, the student body, as noted
above, has been cosmopolitan—over half
coming from outside of the state. At
present, approximately one-third has such
an origin. It is to be hoped that many
outsiders will continue to come, so that
the school may continue to be known as a
national institution. We should realize,
however, that younger institutions have
progressed mightily with the years—and
that many students who formerly would
have come to Michigan will remain in
their home states.
Michigan will retain its status in en-
gineering education and progress even
further if it becomes better known as an
institution that provides an intimate re-
lationship between students, and between
students and faculty, and one that possess-
es well-equipped facilities.
Eleven years of intimate association
with Michigan graduates, students, and
faculty members leaves no doubt in my
mind about the future of the College of
Engineering.

CRUSHING STRENGTH
The ability oi cast iron pip* to withstand
external loads imposed by heavy fill and un-
usual traffic loads is proved by the Ring Com-
pression Test. Standard 6-inch cast iron pipe
withstands a crushing weight oi more than
14.000 lbs. per fool.
BEAM STRENGTH
When cast Iron pipe is subjected to beam
stress caused by soil settlement or disturbance
of soil by other utilities, or resting on an ob-
struction, tests prore that standard 6-inch cast
iron pipe in 10-foot span sustains a load of
15.000 lbs.
SHOCK STRENGTH
The toughness of cast iron pipe which enables
it to withstand impact and traffic shocks, as
well as the hazards in handling. Is demon-
strated by the Impact Test. While under hydro-
static pressure and the heavy blows from a
SO pound hammer, standard 6-inch cast Iron
pipe does not crack until the hammer Is
dropped 6 times on the samo spot from pro-

BURSTING STRENGTH
In full length bursting tests standard 6-lnch
cast iron pipe withstands more than 2500 lbs.

noises in much the same manner as" on
modern streetcars. The brakes are of the
automotive type with internally expand-
ing shoes pressing against drums which
are fastened directly to the wheels. These
brakes are hydraulically operated from a
power unit located in each equipment
unit which is in turn actuated by a con-
ventional air brake train line from the
locomotive. The maximum air brake pres-
sure is about 100 lbs. but when this
pressure is transferred through the hy-
draulic system it is raised to almost 250
lbs., resulting in greatly improved brak-
ing power.
Retractable auxiliary dolly wheels much
like those used on large truck trailers are
located under the forward end of the
units. The small five and one half inch
flanged wheels are lowered by a crank
and worm gear which can be used to raise
the forward end of the unit slightly to
facilitate coupling and uncoupling and
are used to permit the unit to be moved
about the yards separately.
The Talgo Locomotive
The underframe of the Diesel-electric
Talgo locomotive consists essentially of
two 12-inch channels spaced 42 inches
apart in order to permit the main pro-
pulsion engines to be suspended as close
to the rails as possible, thereby creating
an extremely low center of gravity. The
entire structure is welded and stress-re-
leived and is designed to resist a 50,000
lb. buffing load at coupler height. The
cab structure is also of the all-welded
variety and is of girder type construction
to keep deflection to a minimum. The
side panels are 3/16-inch EVE Plymetl
with 24 guage zinc-coated steel on both
sides, while the end sections are of 1/8
inch OHS plate.
The two power trucks are of the swing-
ing-bolster double-equalized variety and
have five and one half inch by ten inch
roller bearing journals. The clasp brakes
are unit type and provide a truck-mounted
air cylinder for each wheel.
The main propulsion engines of the
Talgo are two Hercules model DNXV8S,
automotive type, V8, supercharged Diesels
of 450 HP each, connected to the traction
generators through a ventilated bell hous-
ing. The actual tractive power is pro-
vided by four GE-753 traction motors
with axle drive units. With its 93 27
gear ratio the locomotive has an exception-
ally wide range of speed-tractive effort
performance (17 mph to 105 mph with-
out exceeding the continuous rating of the
traction motors). This is the result of
using two extra-heavy-duty motors with
each of the 405 HP-input generators. The
locomotive can thus be used on either
high speed operation or heavy mountain

How Honeywell Controls help discover
what it's like 90 miles straight up
The U. S. Government uses V-2 rockets
to explore the upper atmosphere. Sensi-
tive instruments in these rockets record
vital data ahout atomic fission, cosmic
rays, weather and many other phenomena
of practical value.
Obviously, every part of these instru-
ments must be especially accurate, de-
pendable and rugged. That's why a
Honeywell Micro Switch was chosen to
control the motor in the V-2's special cam-
era. Directed by this one-ounce switch,
the motor causes the fdm to shift eight
times, then closes the unit for protection
against the enormous impact of landing.
This small but necessary function is
only one of the many jobs Honeywell
Controls now perform in the all-impor-
tant fields of atomic energy, guided mis-
siles and aviation.
Today, fabulous new control devices in
these and other fields are being developed
by the men in our expanding engineering
and research sections. Many of these
workers are keen-minded young men only
recently graduated from the universities.
Equipped with the latest scientific in-
struments, they find their work at Honey-
well provides the kind of challenge they
are looking for, often calls for fascinating
research in the realm of pure science.

PROBLEM — You're working out the application of a
hydraulic speed selector system to a turret lathe. The
system's oil pump Is to be driven by a belt take-off
from the main belt drive. Your problem now is to
provide a means for transmitting power from the pump
drive pulley to the pump that will permit the adjustment
of the pulley to regulate belt tension. How would
you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER — Use an S.S.White flexible shaft
between the pulley shaft and the pump shaft. As you
see below, that's how the Gisholt Machine Co., did It.
An S.S White flexible shaft is the logical answer for a
wide range of drives where one or both of the con-
nected members must be adjustable in position.

This il jusl one of hundreds of power drive and remote control problems
to which S.S.WHITE FLEXIBLE SHAFTS are the simple answer. That's why
engineers will find it helpful to be familiar with the range and (cope of
these "METAL MUSCLES'" for mechanical bodies.

phere; in fact, they only add to all the misinformation and
confusion that has been bandied about smoke abatement since
1307.
Mr. H. B. Lammers in his paper, "Unsolved Problems in
Air Pollution Control", states: "The day is not too far distant
when the public will demand that results be attained and facts
presented. No longer will we be able to confuse the public;
that day is about over. The use of improper standards or com-
parisons does much to discredit an administrator who is at-
tempting to do an honest job."
In Modern Combustion Coal Economics and Fuel Fallacies,
by C. V. Beck, page 91, is the statement, "The net facts of
smoke abatement are these. If smoke is to be abated, the con-
sumer will have to use either a fixed carbon fuel or put in
automatic burning equipment to burn any fuel that is all or
in part a hydro-carbon (soft coal, oil, gas)."
The experience we have gathered in administering Detroit's
Smoke Abatement Ordinance indicates that the majority of
complaints received from the public on air pollution originate
from combustion processes. Most of these complaints origi-
nate in equipment that we class as commercial. This category
includes everything from the three-family dwelling to the small
industrial plant.
Our ordinance requires plans of new installations of com-
bustion equipment to be examined and an installation permit to
be obtained before erection. This procedure is effective in con-
trolling pollution from new installations. But where the fur-
naces or equipment already installed are violators of our air
pollution code, the corrective measures are not so simple.
Smoke can result from defective or faulty equipment, im-
proper fuel, or careless or negligent operation. Any one or any
combination of all three of these large categories may be the
reason for the atmospheric pollution in each individual plant
in violation of our code.
Inspectors
As it is very difficult to obtain properly trained smoke in-
spectors, it was necessary to conduct an inservice training pro-
gram for our inspectors. The results in correcting faulty
operation procedures have been so satisfactory that we are in-
deed enthusiastic about combustion conferences such as this
one.
A paragraph from Power's "Clean Air—The Engineer's
Way" is, I believe, very appropriate in closing. "Does all this
mean that nothing can be done to bring clean air to our cities
and towns? No, but it does mean that we must substitute the
engineering approach for the three-ring circus that is pollution
prevention as it is usually practiced. And this is a job that we,
as power engineers, must tackle, a job this series in Power
plans to point up. First, since any community nuisance is but
the sum of many individual nuisances, we can begin by making
sure our own stacks are clean. Second, as individual citizens
and as members of engineering societies, we can contribute our
know-how to the devising of pollution-prevention programs
that will really work because they make a realistic allowance
for the hard facts that we don't yet know all the answers.
Finally, we can continue the search for the knowledge that
will eventually win a complete victory over air pollution.

—to 20,000 lbs. over Korea
"CALIFORNIA 73" was the popular
\*J name of the best aviation gasoline
ever produced before the day of synthetic
additives. It was the best fuel obtainable
for the pre-World War I planes that used
it. But today it couldn't get one of the
Army's newest heavy transport planes
off the ground.
These new monsters wing westward
across the Sea of Japan, carrying cargoes
of 20,000 lbs., or 64 infantry troops, and
at 18,000 feet fly at over 200 m.p.h. Quite
a lift! And their engines demand fuel with
performance ratings far beyond the prop-
erties of any gasoline that can be sepa-
rated directly from crude.
The most significant difference between
"California 73" and the gasolines in use
today is synthetics of one kind or another.
These man-made petroleum synthetics
blended into modern gasolines have
yielded performance ratings undreamed
of little more than two decades ago. We
have them now thanks to research—in
which Standard Oil has been a leader.
The technically trained men who work
in Standard Oil's research laboratories
and pilot plants cannot foretell future de-
velopments in gasoline. But of one thing
they are certain: it is synthetics that will
make possible tomorrow's even better
aviation gasolines. And when better gaso-
lines are made, research men will help
make them.

grade service with equal facility.
A remarkable degree of vibration iso-
lation has been achieved in the Talgo
locomotive by the use of rubber-in-shear
engine mounting units, probably the larg-
est ever used in a locomotive. Flexible
metal hose, rubber hose and flexible wir-
ing have been used for all engine con-
nections completing an almost perfect
power plant isolation. This reduction of
vibration is expected to reduce greatly the
maintenance costs on the locomotive as
a whole.
Removal of the Diesel engines is much
simpler in the Talgo than in conventional
Diesel-electric locomotives due to the 42-
inch open sill frame construction pre-
viously mentioned. Through the use of
pit-type elevator systems the main Diesels
can be removed and replaced in their sus-
pension systems in a minimum of time by
simply lowering them from their resting
places.
Two Hercules DEXE, six cylinder, in-
line, automotive type Diesels drive the
two auxiliary generators to provide the
train with 208/120 volt, 50 cycle, three-
phase AC power for lighting, air condi-
tioning, and heating purposes. The entire
train not only receives electric power from
the locomotive but also receives its water
supply from the 300-gallon water reser-
voir tanks located there. This trainline
utility system is still another new Talgo
feature which is expected to reduce main-
tenance costs.
The Talgo's Possibilities
The design of ACF's demonstration
Talgo has resulted from the plans for the
trains which are to be used for regular
service in Spain. The interior design of
the present train is by no means the only
one possible with this type of equipment,
but on the contrary can be readily altered
to meet the requirements of any type of
service. Units can be designed for kit-
chens, dining rooms, roomettes, or any
other desired type of accomodations. For
commuter service the coach seats could be
placed closer together and the sixteen
seats per unit could thus easily be in-
creased to twenty or twenty-four.
. ACF has built this train merely to
demonstrate the feasibility of the Talgo
design for use on American as well as
European railroads. With the Talgo now
an operating reality it presented a design
which may possibly revolutionize our en-
tire railroad system.

GIANT WIND TUNNEL
Providing enough power to generate

180,000-horsepower wind tunnel drive
now being built by the General Electric
Company.
The special motor unit, destined to be
the most powerful electric drive of its
kind, is being constructed for the Nation-
al Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
for installation in a new wind tunnel at
Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, Moffett
Field, Calif.
The 180,000-horsepower installation
will consist of four 45,000-horsepower
motors arranged in tandem on a single
shaft.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 19)
Largest of their kind ever built, the
motors each will weigh more than 145
tons, and each wi.l be about the size of a
modern living room. Although rated at
180,C00-horsepower, the four-motor drive
will have a peak one-hour output of
216,000-horsepower, according to G-E
engineers.
Linked to the drive system of the mot-
ors will be two compressors, each about
17 feet in diameter, which will produce
the supsrsonic air streams for the actual
testing. These compressors are similar in
shape and operating principle to the com-
pressors in jet engines, except that they
are much larger, G-E engineers said.
MACHINE TOOLS COULD
PRODUCE MORE
Industry hasn't even begun to reach the
speeds at which metals can be machined
with carbide tools, according to W. R.
Coomey, General Superintendent of Rice-
Barton Corporation, Worcester, Mass.
New machine tools can be developed to
operate several times as fast and turn out
from two to ten times as much defense
material per machine.
This belief, based on experimental
evidence compiled by Mr. Coomey's or-
ganization, was expressed in a talk b;fore
the Annual Meeting of the American So-
ciety of Tool Engineers as part of the
ASTE's program to share and exchange
new technical information among the
"men with production know-how".
The Rice Barton tests indicate that
speeds at which the cutting tool moves
through the steel at 16 miles per hour
or better are entirely feasible. Main re-
quirements, according to Mr. Coomey,
are machines capable of the required speed
and feed combinations.
Mr. Coomey cited several supporting
experimental examples. In one, milling
cutter and workpiece remained cool at
1435 feet per minute, with 20, 1000-inch
feed per tooth. When the feed was re-
duced to 1 10th of this, both workpiece
and cutter became too hot to touch, indi-
cating that the decrease in feed was detri-
mental to tool life. In another test a
planing machine consumed 92 horsepower
when cutting steel at 100 feet per minute;
when the speed was tripled, power con-
sumption went down to 55 horsepower.

raphy. It is a means of making frequent production b'ne
analyses that keep a check on specifications.

SHOWS STRESSES AND STRAINS VISUALLY. By photographing
the patterns developed by polarized light as it passes through
a plastic model of a part, the engineer can have visible evi-
dence of the points of stress within die part.
In the engineering laboratory—on the production line-
photography is today an important tool. It searches metal
structure through electron micrography, x-ray diffraction,
and micro-radiography. It makes swift mechanical motions
seeable by showing them at a snail's pace with high speed
movies. Or it can halt an instant of an instrument's fleeting
trace and record it for study.

Four broad avenues by which college graduates
begin careers with General Electric ...
Both the individual and the company learn a lot when
a college graduate enrolls in one of these four basic
General Electric training programs.
The individual familiarizes himself with the com-
pany's products, organization, and problems. By rotat-
ing through a series of varied job assignments he
determines the kind of work that most appeals to him
and to which he feels he can make the greatest con-
tribution. Many students go on from these courses to
more specialized training in advanced engineering,
sales, manufacturing, etc.
On its part the company learns about the individual's
abilities and capacities. The training programs are a
major means of recognizing young people of talent and
creative ability, of making sure that they move ahead
to new and constantly more challenging assignments.
A very large percentage of General Electric's top
scientists, specialists and managers of today began
their careers as student-workers in company-conducted
training programs.
