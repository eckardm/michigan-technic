illing Stations on the High Seas
An Interesting Article on the Development of the Submarine
Oil Pipe Line for Discharging Tank Steamers and for Bunkering Merchantmen
By George F. Prussing, '15E
'I 'HE petroleum industry is one of those ramified
-*- businesses having not only their sources of
raw material and their markets for finished pro-
duct scattered all over the globe, but which also
draw to them and utilize the energies and brains
of a vast variety of artisans and professional people.
The engineer and his close cousin, the geologist,
are today just coming into their rightful position
with relation to this industry. Rightful, because
nowhere is their service of greater productive value;
a recent achievement, because the industry has for
years been living very largely from a constant inflow
of new capital and it has therefore been possible to
get along with methods so wasteful and so un-
scientific as literally to shock the imagination.
An article of this sort can do little more than
touch on the high points of the industry as a whole,
or, as has been done here, to develop some little
detail of more than passing interest. The gasoline
filling station which has sprung up in many of our
American cities during the past few years is familiar
to all of us. It was made economically necessary
by the tremendous increase in the use of the auto-
mobile and has been the means of eliminating one
middleman in the marketing of refined oils. Few
of us, however, know that an almost equally con-
venient facility is afforded the oil-burning merchant-
men and that where harbor facilities are lacking,
connection may be made to a vessel from a pipeline
laid along the floor of the sea.
Oil in any form can only be sold if and where
there is assured a constant and uninterrupted sup-
ply. The conversion of boilers in industry and on
railroads, in ships and power-plants, from coal to
oil, is relatively simple mechanically and the econo-
mic balance point is not difficult to find, where the
price and the advantages inherent in liquid fuel war-
rant the change. But the supply must be assured,
and to make it so, especially in the out-of-the-way
places of the world, is one of the constant problems
of the petroleum engineer.
It was while working at a solution of this very
problem that there was developed the use of sub-
marine insulated pipe lines, by which tank steamers
might be discharged and merchantment bunkered
while lying at anchor in open roadsteads'. On our
own seaboard, protected by natural and artificial
barriers to ocean storms, with our pipelines termi-
nating at docks where vessels can at all times tie
up in perfect security, we see but little need of such
devices. But in Mexico and on the west coast of
Chile, where natural harbors are few and the
growth of commerce has not yet warranted the
building of expensive breakwaters, the submarine
line alone has made possible the handling of oil in
bulk. In Chile this has brought about the rapid
conversion of the industries and railways to the
use of fuel oil and has opened a large and profitable
market for the sale of all petroleum products.
In Chile, the principal industry is mining for

nitrates and metals. These metal mines are located
in the mountains at a considerable elevation, and
at some distance from the coast. Many serious diffi-
culties are encountered in transporting fuel over
the Andes to these mines. One can better realize
the situation by a glance at the cover photograph,
which was taken on July 25th, at Juncal, Chile. The
picture shows a rotary suction snow plow attached
to a section of the international transcontinental
train ready to continue on its way over the snow-
clad mountains. The transportation of fuel over
this railroad for the mining industry has been a
serious factor in determining its cost owing to these
difficulties. Because of these facts, the use of coal,
the first fuel used in modern developments, has been
especially expensive. Recently there have been two
distinct steps taken to reduce the cost of power at
the mines. The first of these was the conversion
of coal-burning engines and plants to the use of
the more economically transported fuel oil, and
the second was the generation of electrical energy
at tidewater by means of oil-fired steam plants, and
the transmission of this power over high-voltage
lines to the mining districts in the mountains.
Fuel Oil in Mining Industry
An excellent example of such a tide-water gen-
erating station* is the plant of the Chile Explora-
tion Company, located at the little town of Toco-

S. S. Cordelia Discharging at Taltal
pilla and supplying power for the Chile Copper Com-
pany at the latter's mines and refineries at Chiqui-
camata, some ninety miles inland and at 10,000 feet
elevation. The boiler capacity of this plant is given
a nominal rating of 12,300 horsepower, but the gen-
erating equipment delivers 50,000 kwa. on the bus
bars. A three phase transmission line carries this
energy, stepped up to 110,000 volts, to substations
located at the mines, where the major portion of
it is converted to direct current for use in the refin-
eries.
In times of prosperity, such plants as the one
just described are large users of fuel oil, as are also
the nitrate fields, the railroads, and other industries.
In addition, there is a growing market for semi-
refined oil for use in Diesel engines, as well as for
refined oils of all sorts. The lubricating and light
oils, such as gasoline and kerosene, are still handled

,; This description of the Chile Exploration Company's
plant is taken from a very interesting article in Power of
March, 1920.
The Mole and Loading Rack at Tocapilla
largely in small metal containers, principally in the
live-gallon can, familiar all over the world. But
fuel oils are now pumped directly from ship to tank
on shore by means of the ship's pumps and through
the medium of the submarine pipe line. Through
these same lines are served the merchant ships
applying for fuel to replenish their bunkers, the oil
in this case being pumped from the shore tanks by
means of engine-driven pumps located on shore.
The Union Oil Company of California operates
a number of destributing stations located on the
coast of Chile. At present there are six such sta-
tions, located in Iquique, Tocopilla, Mejillones,
Antofagasta, Taltal, and Valparaiso. These plants
differ somewhat in size and capacity but in general
consist of storage tanks, up to 55,000 bbls. in con-
tent, for the storage of fuel oils, with pumping
facilities for bunkering and for loading tank cars.
Drumfilling appliances and can fillers are of the
usual type met with in American practice. Refined
oils are received in drums and reloaded into "tins"
for retailing. All stations have housing facilities
for the agents and often for others, such as divers
and pumpmen, who must be in constant attendance.
Separate pipelines of small size serve vessels with
fresh water at some stations, where there is an abun-
dant supply for more than local use.
How a Cargo Is Discharged

were built extending to within striking distance of
safe anchorage. But the storms for which the coast
of Chile is famous have time and again swept away
these slender structures, and they have had to be
supplemented by pipe lines supported upon barrel
or log rafts and connected by lengths of heavily
reinforced rubber hose. Eventually these make-
shifts will be replaced by permanent pipelines laid
along the floor of the sea, such as are now in use
at the four other stations. One of the illustrations
shows the S. S. "Cordelia" discharging a cargo over
the mole at Taltal. This picture was taken in Octo-
ber, 1919, since which date the mole shown and like-
wise its successor have both been carried away.
The ordinary procedure for discharging a cargo
at one of the stations where submarine lines are
in use is relatively simple, especially in fair weather.
Permanent anchorage is provided by concession
from the Chilean Government and indicated by steel
buoys carrying the usual type of stud-link anchor
chains. To these and to its own anchors the ves-
sel is made fast, so as to place its stern hard by the
end of the pipe line, its head pointing out to sea.
In this position the ship is ready to drop anchor
and steam seaward in case of sudden storm. A
barge or lighter has previously been anchored over
the end of the pipe line. On it is the necessary
hose for connecting the ship to the submarine line,
and from it a diver descends to make the connection.
The ship's pumps then discharge the tanker's cargo
at the rate of 400 to 2,500 barrels per hour to the
shore tanks, the rate varying largely with the char-
acter of the commodity.
Many Difficulties Are Encountered
To the layman oil, is oil, but it is obvious that
gasoline may be more easily pumped than asphalt,
and while, as a matter of fact, neither of these com-
modities is so handled in the South American trade,
they are in other places and may serve here as
extreme examples of the differences in viscosities
that are met with. For example, Diesol, a trade-
marked semi-refined fuel oil used by Diesel engines,
will flow readily at any temperature, while Port
Lobos (Mexico) crude and the asphaltic residium
shipped from Port San Luis Obispo, California, re-
semble molasses in January and must be heated
before they will flow except under extreme pres-
sures. Such pressures are quite permissible on
transcontinental pipe lines, where 800 lbs. per square
inch is common practice, but they cannot be used in
discharge of tank steamers. The best rubber hose
made cannot be depended upon to stand more than
150 lbs. pressure when connecting a fixed pipe at a
depth of eight fathoms with the deck of a ship toss-
ing at anchor, and more than 85 lbs. is the working
limit. Because of these conditions and the loss en-
tailed in keeping an expensive vessel at anchor, all
ships in the South American oil trade are being
fitted with steam heating coils in their oil tanks.
The heating can be done with .exhaust steam just
prior to discharge and thus requires neither addi-
tional time nor steam. The exact effect of heating
is, of course, to reduce the viscosity of the oil and
thcrebv its frictional resistance to transmission

Laying Pipe Lines at Mejh.lones
through the pipe lines. It has been demonstrated
that oil heated to 125 degrees F. loses but 2 degrees
when pumped through 1500 feet of insulated ten-
inch line.
There have been a number of attempts made
in various quarters to insulate submarine pipe lines
but the most thorough experiments along the lines
of heat and corrosion resistance have been made
under direction of Mr. Ralph J. Reed, '08, Chief
Engineer of the Union Oil Company of California.
Early installations of bare iron pipe had demon-
strated several inherent weaknesses. In addition to
cooling the oil as it was pumped ashore and conse-
quently retarding its flow, these Hues were con-
stantly subjected to the corrosive action of salt
water and the marine growths peculiar to subtrop-
ical waters. These later are especially virulent. A

certain low form of life, somewhat resembling the
common barnacle, attaches itself to the pipe at the
joints and, apparently by the solvent action of its
secretions, causes failure of the pipe. Marine ani-
mals have actually been known to enter metal pipe
lines, though whether their attack was mechanical
or really chemical in its nature is still problematic.
Economically and practically the result is the same
as though they used drills, for the pipe becomes
so weakened at the joints that its life is extremely
short. To counteract these destructive influences
the experiments referred to above were conducted
at the Los Angeles Refinery of the Union Oil Com-
pany.

Hauling Out Submarine Line at Antofagasta
After many trials, a covering was developed in
1920 which has since been adopted as standard and
has been used with success on three South Amer-
ican installations. It consists of a heavy layer of
spongefelt laid on with hot asphalt and wrapped
securely with burlap, which in turn receives another
coating of hot asphalt. Over this first course, which
is principally for heat insulation, is laid a course of
longitudinal wood staves, made from creosoted fir
and formed after the fashion of wood stave pipe.
This lagging is clamped into place by steel rods at
frequent intervals and is again treated to a hot coat-
ing of asphalt to make it water proof and to discour-
age marine growths.
Methods of Pipe Laying
Needless to say, the insulation must be applied
on shore. Wherever local conditions permit, the
pipe line is made up for its entire length at right
angles to the surf-line and the insulation applied
just prior to launching. However, this is not always
possible, for much of the South American shore line
is skirted by bluffs so close to the water line that
but one or two joints of pipe can be laid out. Such
a conditon is plainly illustrated in one of the ac-
companying photographs. That is a serious compli-
cation, but no part of the entire procedure is exactly
a holiday performance. To launch and anchor such
a bulky, buoyant tube, often quarter of a mile long,
through surf and undertow, is a job to try the pa-
tience of a saint and the ingenuity of an Irishman.
Once the pipe has been lagged, it is blocked up on
a wooden track by means of rollers. Over it and
not far from the water's edge is built an "A" frame
of heavy timbers. A lighter is securely anchored at
the point in the bay where the end of the pipe line
will eventually rest, and on it another "A" frame
is erected. Between the two frames is now strung
a heavy wire rope cable. This cable serves the
double purpose of supporting the pipe line and as
anchorage for the tackle by which it is dragged out.
The line is first sealed and blown full of air under
pressure to prevent ingress of water, should leaks
develop. The end of the line is then fastened to the
cable by means of block and tackle, the other end
of which is out in the surf. By main strength the
line is dragged through the "A" frame; as each sec-
tion comes under the frame a snatch block is hooked
over the cable and made fast to the pipe, until even-
tually it hangs suspended, just awash, reaching from
the shoreline to the lighter. When finallyinthat posi-
tion, and that "finally" often means days on end of
heartbreaking labor against surf and undertow, the
line is pumped full of water to reduce its buoyancy
and the cable supporting it is slackened until the
pipe finally rests on the floor of the sea.
That the new lines are an improvement over the
earlier installations is obvious, though the actual
measure of their superiority cannot be determined
at this early stage of their life. They have proved
their complete success in so far as their heat in-
sulating qualities go, and their workmanship has
been highly satisfactory. Not a leak of any conse-
quence developed in any of the three installations
of this type of line, and the rate of discharge has
been increased by their use as much as was expected.
Only their resistance to corrosion must be left to
time to measure, and of this there is a fairly sate
criterion in the tests made with creosoted lumber
under the trying conditions of San Pablo Bay at
Oleum, near San Francisco. The cost per year of
life is the only cost that really counts, and that
promises to be sufficiently low to warrant similar
installations in the future.
Local Political Troubles

the fact that the Port of Antofagasta, Chile, was.
given governmental aid in building its port-works,

One is tempted to say that it seems very strange
that so little is written and generally known about
the mining, smelting and refining of copper, which,
next to iron, is probably the most commonly used
metal. On investigation, however, it is perhaps not
so strange that so little is written and consequently
so little generally known. Copper is among the
metals that were pro-
duced at a very early date
by very crude methods,
and along with tin figures
as the agent that names
the Bronze Age. The
demand for copper has
constantly increased but
during the past fifty
years or more the mining,
smelting, and refining of
this metal has fallen into
the hands of several
corporations which have
seen fit to keep their
affairs quite to them-
selves.
When one learns some-
thing of the inside of the
complete industry of the
production of copper he
finds that relatively little
real research has been done as we know such re-
search work in connection with the various prod-
ucts of iron. One of the reasons for this lack of
research work is that the demand for copper has
generally been either equal to or in excess of the
supply. As a consequence the few corporations
which control the mines and refineries have been
able to operate by relatively crude methods and
charge the costs of these methods plus any profit
they desired to the public that has demanded their
product. Such a state of affairs is of course not
conducive to real research work, and it probably
will be another fifty years before we shall have seen
the kind of research work that has become very
common in the production of iron and the various
steels.
By far the larger percentage of copper used in
the world is produced in the western hemisphere;
and in considering the western hemisphere, the
greater percentage comes from the United States
and Mexico. Most of our high-grade ore deposits
have been consumed, or are well on their way to be
Editor's Note.—The writer of this article, Col. H.
W. Miller, became affiliated with the Baltimore Copper
Smelting and Rolling Company in the capacity of Engi-
neer immediately after his discharge from the army.
This company, established in 1850, is a pioneer in
every branch of the copper refining field and is the
producer of 20 per cent of the world's copper.
The article will appear in two installments. The
first installment, appearing in this issue, will give a
general history of the whole industry. Further, it fol-
lows the copper from the mines to the refinery and
describes in detail both the preparation of the material
for refining and the Series Process of refining.
In the January issue will be found a thorough treat-
ment of the Multiple Process of refining, the recovery
of the valuable impurities and the manufacture of cop-
per into sheets, wire, and tubes.

unpublished description of the most advanced methods
of copper production, is one which the students of the
Engineering College cannot afford to miss, particularly
as it is written by one so competent as Colonel Miller.
consumed, and we are now drawing rather heavily
on the low-grade deposits. Rather promising mines
have been opened in Chile in the last dozen years,
and the production of copper from South America
is increasing yearly. The ores from which copper
is secured are Cuprite, Malachite, Melaconite, Ches-
syllite, Atacamite, Chalcocite, Chalcopyrite, and
Chrysocolla. These ores
are found in Montana,
Wyoming, Colorado, Ne-
braska, Arizona, New
Mexico, Mexico, and
Chile. The name "Cop-
per" comes down to us
through the following ev-
olution: Aes Cyprium,
Cyprium, Cyprum, and,
finally, (Copper, Cuivre,
Cupfer).
Native Copper Found in
Northern Michigan
In the northern penin-
sula of the State of
Michigan a very unique
deposit of native copper
has been found and
worked for many years.
Native copper is almost
always found with copper ores, but seldom in very
large quantities. Apparently the large ore deposits
that may have existed in northern Michigan were
reduced through the excessive heat of the earth
many thousands of years ago and now is found
mingled with the gravel even to depths of as great
as a mile. The copper that is secured from this
region of course requires no smelting and does not
require exactly the same measures in refining as
that produced from the ores named above. The
corporation which controls the Lake Superior
region is a competitor of those which produce cop-
per from the ores and finds itself in a somewhat
better position in that the cost of complete pro-
duction is somewhat reduced. This gave that
particular corporation the advantage during the
recent severe slump in the copper industry.
Before passing to the descriptions of the various
processes of smelting and refining, it might be well
to add another word with reference to the back-
wardness of the copper industry as compared with
the steel and aluminum industries. As one travels
(90

about Europe he generally finds in the various
homes rather complete sets of kitchen utensils of
copper. Most of these utensils were purchased be-
fore aluminum was available and were purchased
instead of iron because of the fact that the people
of Europe are inclined to be most careful in the
selection of material for wearing qualities and qual-
ity of service. Copper has quite generally been
used in America for large kettles, moulding certain
ornaments, chafing dishes, and so forth, but there
has been no general use of this metal in homes.
As soon as economical methods were found for the
reduction of aluminum ore and the production of
any desired utensils from the refined metal, the
aluminum corporation proceeded to wage a very
effective campaign to induce the public to stock
with every conceivable form of aluminum imple-
ment. One hardly need describe this campaign.
Salesmen have been in all of our homes on numer-
ous occasions; demonstrations have been staged;
and one cannot walk along any street without find-
ing a display of aluminum ware of some variety.
When compared with copper, aluminum is found to
be inferior for most household purposes. Copper
is heavier, of course, and perhaps a little effort is
needed to keep it in the finest of condition, but it
makes a better cooking utensil and when kept in
good condition, presents a much better appearance.
Because of the fact that the demand for copper for
general commercial purposes has been equal to or
in excess of the supply, the various corporations
controlling copper have paid little or no attention to
a selling organization or a selling campaign to in-
crease the demand for their product. The conse-
quence of this is that the American public seldom
thinks of copper in terms of household utensils
unless it be a chafing dish or a copper wash boiler,
and in 1914 as well as in 1921 the copper industries
suffered most severe slumps because, through con-
ditions brought about by the war, there suddenly
was no commercial demand for their product. One
cannot predict whether these corporations have
learned their lesson or not. The moral of the lesson
seems so obvious that one would think they would
begin to take the necessary steps to prevent another
such slump as has just passed. There are some
signs of their appreciation of the need of a real
selling organization and a selling campaign in
recent advertisements in certain magazines where
they are attempting to persuade the public to use
copper for the roofs of buildings.
Majority of Copper Obtained from Ores
The larger percentage of copper today is gotten
from the low-grade ores of Montana, Wyoming,
Colorado, etc., where the ore is gotten out by steam
shovels which in the course of years literally move
mountains. This ore is carried down the side of
the mountains to the blast furnaces, which are not
materially unlike the blast furnaces with which
we are all familiar in the reduction of iron ore. The
copper is roasted in these furnaces with limestone
and coke and comes out as a crude metallic copper
known as "Matte." This matte contains the very
undesirable impurities, arsenic and sulphur. The
copper matte then passes through a converter not
materially unlike the Bessemer converters used in
the making of steel, where sulphur combines with
the oxygen of the air which is blown through the
copper and the excessive heat vaporizes and re-
moves quite a little of the arsenic. Th? resulting
metal is poured in cakes approximately 24x15x4
inches. This copper, which is known as blister
copper, is very porous and blistery on the surface
and contains all of the so-called impurities which
the refineries must later remove. These impuri-
ties include gold, silver, nickel, iron, lead, sulphur,
platinum, selenium, telurium, paladium, tantalum,
zinc, bizmuth, arsenic, antimony, cobalt, and a few
others.
Two Electrolytic Processes are Used
Since practically all of the copper is refined elec-
trically and adequate supplies of electric power are
not always available at the copper smelters, the cop-
per is usually shipped to one of four or five refiner-
ies located in various places in the United States.
One of these refineries is located in Baltimore and is
known as the Baltimore Copper Smelting and Roll-
ing Company, and was formerly the Baltimore Elec-
tronic Refinery. This refinery, which was original-
ly established on Gunpowder River in about 1850
and refined at the time a few hundred tons of copper
per month, has since grown to be the largest re-
finery in the world and has a capacity of approxi-
mately 30,000 tons per month, which represents
about 20 percent of the world's consumption of cop-
per in normal times. A large portion of the descrip-
tions given hereafter of processes involved in the
casting and rolling of copper will be descriptions of
processes in this plant, for which the writer served
as engineer for a year prior to his coming to the
University of Michigan. The present plant of
the Baltimore Copper Smelting and Rolling Com-
pany is located just beside the refinery of the
Standard Oil Company and thereby enjoys the
the enviable advantage of having its fuel supply just
next door. It has its own docks and before the war
at least approximately 90% of its finished product
was shipped abroad. Since the war most of its pro-
duct has been marketed in the United States be-
cause of the inability of the European countries to
purchase.

The copper which left the converters mentioned
above in the shape of blister cakes is received at the
refinery by rail and by ship and is refined electrical-
ly by either one of two processes. The one is known
as the Series Process and is analogous to the con-
necting of a number of electric cells in series. This
total process involves, first, a casting-house for the
melting of the rough cakes and conversion into other
cakes of a particular shape and size, second, a roll-
ing mill to roll these cakes into sheets, and third,
an electrolytic refinery for the removal of all impuri-
ties listed above.
The second system of refining is known as the
Multiple System and is analogous to the connecting
of a number of electric cells in parallel. This sys-
tem requires likewise a casting-house, but in this
casting-house the original blister cakes are cast into
cakes of a peculiar form for charging directly into
the electric refining tanks. The rolling mill is elim-
inated in this process. As one inspects a refinery
in which both processes are employed he is impress-
ed with the fact that the latter system—that is, the
multiple—seems to lend itself much better to mod-
ern methods of production. First, the elimination
of the rolling mill seems very desirable, and second,
it is found possible to charge the peculiarly shaped
cakes of raw copper into the refining tanks by means
of cranes which can handle the charge of half a tank
at one time. The refined copper is removed likewise
by means of cranes, and the refinery presents a
much more business-like appearance than the series
refinery. The series refinery, however, has the ad*
vantage of removing a higher percentage of the im-
purities than the multiple system. These impurities
include silver and gold and since the demand for sil-
ver at one dollar per ounce is still in force, the series
system continues in action. There probably will
come a time when it will be abandoned for the other.
SERIES PROCESS
The blister copper from the smelters is charged
into open hearth furnaces which are about 40 feet
long by 15 feet wide and 10 feet high with walls ap-
proximately 18 inches thick and roof about 12 inches
thick. The floor of these furnaces is of grain mag-
nesite, that is, granular magnesite, and is about 24
inches thick. The brick of one of these furnaces
costs about $20,000 and the maintenance on fifteen
furnaces of the Baltimore Copper Works amounts
to approximately $400,000 per year. This mainten-
ance is under the charge of a specially trained fore-
man and crew who give it their full attention. There
are in these furnaces some bricks which cost as
much as $1.00 each. These bricks are the peculiarly
shaped bricks required for certain places in the roof.
When operated day after day, usually one charge
in 24 hours, the roofs of one of these furnaces will
last about three months and the floors about 12
years. The furnaces are generally arranged in pairs
with a power charging machine between them and
the large charging doors facing each other. Each
furnace is supplied with two charging doors about 3
feet high by 8 feet long. These openings are closed
in some plants by large brick-lined cast-iron doors
suspended from cables above and in other refine-
ries by two cast-iron doors supported on hinges on
either side of the opening. The copper is charged
into these furnaces at the Baltimore Copper Works
by Morgan machines, the charge in the casting-
house under discussion being about 200 tons per
furnace. After the furnaces are charged the doors
are closed and all the openings mudded up with
fire-clay and the oil blast turned gradually up to
the point of consumption of approximately 350 to
400 gallons per hour. It has been found best to
lire these furnaces with oil and through an open-
ing about one foot square in the rear of the
furnace. When the furnaces have been first
charged the cakes of copper reach almost to the
roof and it is difficult for an hour or more to con-
sume the oil completely because of the large amount
of cold copper which tends to condense the oil vapor.
This oil is of course burned later and need not be
considered lost. The 200 tons that comprise a
charge is sufficient when melted down to make a
lake of copper 40 feet by 15 feet by about 15 inches
deep, reaching almost to the level of the large charg-
ing doors. The floor of such a furnace being made
originally of granular magnesite of course finally be-
comes a solid cake of granular magnesite and cop-
per, the copper gradually soaking down almost to
the bottom. This granular magnesite is supported
on a brick tunnel passing under the furnace from
end to end and air is forced through this tunnel to
keep the bottom of the floor cool. If this were not
done the floor would become excessively hot and
burn out in fewer years than otherwise.
Heavy Residue Oil Used for Fuel
The oil used in these furnaces is the heavy resi-
due oil from the refineries of the Standard Oil Com-
pany nearby and is the last oil coming from the still
before the coke with which we are familiar in this
town. This oil at normal temperature is a heavy
black oil that cannot easily be pumped through any
except very large pipes. It has a gravity of 14
Baume and has a heat content of about 18,500 Brit-
ish thermal units per ton. It is received first into
very large storage tanks where it is maintained at
about ioo0 F. It is pumped from here into 5,000
gallon individual tanks supplied for each of the
furnaces. Each tank is graduated for the purpose

of keeping tab on the rate of consumption of oil, it
being possible to follow this rate of consumption by
means of a float gauge arrangement. Previously it
was not possible to determine the rate satisfactorily
through the use of flow meters. The oil pumped
then from these individual tanks by means of
Gould Triplex pumps at a pressure of 100 pounds
per square inch to the individual furnaces. By-pass
valves are of course provided and return pipes for
the return of the oil pumped in excess of the amount
required. All pipes are well insulated to prevent
the loss of heat, which of course has been secured
from steam. At the furnaces it is heated to approxi-
mately 3000 F by means of superheated steam to fa-
cilitate atomization. It passes through the burner
at about five pounds pressure and is atomized there
by superheated steam at 3500 F.
Most of the furnaces at the Baltimore Copper
Works have for a number of years used the "Best"
burner, but other burners have been used with
greater success in the last year. With the Best
burner only sufficient pressure is maintained on the
oil at the burner to cause it to rise to the point
where the flat, horizontal jet of steam catches it and
drives it atomized into the furnace. Approximately
one pound of steam to three pounds of oil is re-
quired for this atomization, which seems to be re-
latively complete and satisfactory.
As soon as possible after closing the furnaces the
consumption of oil is forced up to about 350 gallons
per hour and maintained at this rate for approxi-
mately ten hours, when within a half-hour the com-
plete charge is melted, or, in terms of the refinery,
"brought flat." Copper is such an efficient conduct-
or of heat that almost the entire charge reaches the
melting point at the same time. Of course the
pieces exposed directly to the oil blast may melt
down slowly in advance, but the percentage of cop-
per that is melted prior to the last hour of the time
is relatively small. The temperature of the copper
when it is brought flat is approximately 21000 F and
the maximum temperature in the furnace is prob-
ably not in excess of 2600 or 28000 F. The furnace
is so shaped that the blast is forced down on the
top of the bath of copper at the forward end of the
furnace, that is, at the verb. The furnace is white
hot at this time and all oil is quite efficiently con-
sumed. Certain operations are conducted in this
casting-house for the multiple process, but they are
not absolutely essential and will be described in con-
nection with the casting of refined copper where
they are essential.
Tapping Similar to that of Blast Furnace
From four to six hours are consumed in the opera-
tions, the description of which we are omitting, after
the charge is brought flat. As soon as these opera-
tions are completed the furnaces are ready to tap
and are tapped from the front, just as a blast fur-
nace. The front of each furnace is provided with a
vertical opening about four inches wide reaching to
the level of the floor. This opening is filled with mud
before the furnace is charged and iron bars fastened
across the front to prevent the baked mud being
forced out. The mud of course burns hard and is
gradually dug away by means of an iron as the cop-
per pours from the furnace. The copper is poured
into a large ladle on an electrically driven car and
transferred to a reheating furnace which is simply
a horizontal brick-lined steel cylinder about six feet
in diameter by ten feet long. The real purpose of
the provision of this reheating furnace is to permit
the casting to be done on a single casting wheel,
while the copper has been melted in several fur-
naces. This reheating furnace is fired likewise by
oil and the copper maintained at a temperature of
approximately 21000. This reheating furnace is so
arranged that it can be tilted to pour the copper into
a tilting ladle and thence into the moulds on the
wheel.
Practically all casting of copper in a refinery is
done in copper moulds. On first thought this might
seem extravagant, but it is really the essence of
economy. If cast-iron moulds were used, when they
were broken they could only be sold as junk for a
cent or less per pound, having been purchased for
at least six cents per pound. When the copper
moulds are condemned for further use, they can
be charged into the furnaces, melted, and poured in-
to new moulds. No copper is lost and no injury is
done the metal. The cost is therefore simply the
cost of melting and casting and the interest on the
copper so tied up. One might find several million
pounds of copper tied up into moulds but it is al-
ways available and can always be melted and cast
into shapes for the market if necessary.
Casting Wheel is Used
The procedure employed in casting practically all
shapes except the heavy cakes in this refinery in-
volves the use of a casting wheel devised by the
President and General Manager. This casting
wheel comprises a circular drum not unlike a rail-
way turn-table about 15 feet in diameter and three
or four feet high. This drum is supported on a ser-
ies of conical rollers and is driven by an electric
motor, the operator being stationed in a seat over
the sides of this drum or cylinder and reach out a
distance of about 12 feet. The ends of these arms
form a bearing into which trunnions on the ends of
the copper moulds fit and the arms, being capable

A Personal Sketch of Dean Mortimer E. Cooley
By Genevieve Sproat, '24
Mary: My laundry bill was $4.68 this week.
Jane: Oh, mine was only $1.00.
Mary: Yes, but you don't go with an engineer.
SUCH JOKES about the engineer are common,
but somehow they do not seem to apply to
the Michigan "slide-rulers." Perhaps it is because
these particular men are reflections of such a fine
example as Dean M. E. Cooley of that quality which
is supposed to be next to Godliness. In much the
same way as the Mechanicals, Electricals, Civils,
etc. at Michigan are emulators of their well-
groomed chief through their own volition so did
he during his college days emulate one of his pro-
fessors through necessity.
Attired in a new suit of clothes, with the baggy
trousers which were so popular then, and with his
luxuriant, curly hair showing to the best advantage,
as will be noted by the photograph, young Mortimer
Cooley entered the Naval Academy in 1874. A
few days later, still with the same curly locks that
he took with him from the farm he appeared with
the other raw recruits, in the freshman mathematics
class, which was presided over by Commander
Chadwick, who was later Rear-Admiral Chadwick,
Sampson's chief of staff at Santiago. The latter
was a dignified, immaculately dressed officer with
an unmistakable English accent. The Commander
immediately singled out Cadet Cooley because of
his beautiful curly locks and after class called him
up to his desk where the following conversation
ensued:
"What's youah name, suh?"
"Cooley, sir."
"Mistah Cooley, get youah hair cut!"
Unfortunately the only available barber shop
was crowded and finally closed before "Mistah
Cooley" had a chance to climb into the coveted
chair. So he had to go to class the next day
without having had tonsorial assistance.
After class the Commander called him up to his
desk again.
"What's youah name, suh?"
"Cooley, sir."
"Mistah Cooley, DON'T COME TO CLASS
AGAIN WITHOUT YOUAH HAIR CUT!!"
That time the young man managed to occupy
the barber's chair, and got his hair clipped. The
next time he went to class he was again called up
after class.
"What's youah name, suh?"
"Cooley, sir."
"Mistah Cooley, very much bettah, suh, VERY
MUCH BETTAH!"
About the same time the men's clothing was
inspected to see whether it fitted or not. In refer-
ring to the outfit which had been assigned to him,
Cadet Cooley inquired:

The First Engineering Laboratory
"Aren't my pants too long, Mr. Chadwick?"
"Pants, suh? Pants!! No such thing, suh!
They are trousahs, suh, TROUSAHS!"
"And how about my vest, Mr. Chadwick?"
"Nevah say 'vest,' suh, say 'westcut' I"
Many years afterward during the Spanish War,
Dean Cooley, who was then Chief Engineer on the
U. S. S. YOSEMITE, again met Rear Admiral
Chadwick at Guantanamo in command of a ship
there. He went up to pay his respects and to
introduce himself. After looking over the chief
engineer very carefully with an appraising eye, and
evidently approving of his appearance as well as his
haircut, his old teacher replied, "No need to intro-
duce youahself, suh; I remembah you very well,
Mistah Cooley!"

in making the Dean always look well to his neatness
in dress, the admirable quality of continually trying
to make people feel comfortable and happy comes
to him naturally. He often makes the remark,
"When a man is able to give fun to others, that
is his duty."

The Dean and His Curly Locks
One day he came down to the office with a flam-
boyant red necktie which even outshone the Cooley
smile. He did not remain long, but boldly march-
ed over to the meeting of the Board of Regents,
striking the attitude that his only passport into
that venerable gathering was his cervical adorn-
ment. When he returned, he explained that he
had had a great favor to -ask of the Regents in
the interests of the Engineering College. Wishing
to put them in good humor beforehand, he used his
ludicrous red necktie for bait, thereby causing a
great deal of merriment and subsequently accomp-
lishing the purpose for which he had worn it.
A boy was once asked the difference between a
"sissy" and a regular fellow. He replied: "A regu-
lar fellow is a guy who isn't afraid to say 'damn'
once in a while." The Dean has a few favorite
swear words so firmly fixed in his vocabulary (why
blame the Navy for them?) that he has an un-
written agreement with his office staff that he may
use them whenever he pleases and yet, without oral
mention of the fact, be graciously pardoned.
Like most people, Professor Cooley has his own
little idiosyncrasies. One is his fondness for man-
sized matches. When one realizes what a large
man he is physically, it is easy to understand how
elusive a safety match could be when playing hide-
and-go-seek in the palm of his hand. So in order
not to strain his eyes and perhaps his patience he
always has a large bowl on the tree trunk variety
within easy reach on his desk.
He also has an aversion for "Continued on page
so and so", articles in magazines, when the con-
tinued part is sandwiched in between columns of
advertising in such a manner that to locate it is a
puzzle, not to mention the struggle after discovery
to concentrate upon the subject mater, flanked in
as it is by diverting ads on either side. We agree
with the Dean when he says: "If you and I were
engaged in conversation and a chap butted in be-
tween and tried to sell us a cake of soap, what
would you do to him? And yet the American
people stand for it." One person, wishing very
much to have the Dean read a particular article of
this nature, ruthlessly snipped out all the pages
between the main part and the continued part to-
gether with the advertisments on either side, and
presented the article to him stripped of its em-
bellishments, much to his amusement.
Professor Cooley has one hobby and that is the
collecting of oriental rugs. He has a most excellent
collection of all kinds and descriptions, and delights
in trying to distinguish between the different tribal
pieces and in pointing out their characteristics.
Xot long ago while visiting the store of a prominent
rug dealer in Chicago, he made friends with a little
eleven-year-old girl whom the rug dealer had

As a Promising Young Cadet
adopted. In her admiration for the professor she
wove an exquisite little prayer rug for him which
took her a month to complete and which the Dean
considers one of his choicest.
Lately the Dean has been experimenting with

poetry, no doubt in an effort to prove that an engi-
neer may and should be both practical and poetical.
"When the sap runs", the results might very well
be mistakn for a product of the Literary College
rather than from "my friend Cooley of the Tin
Shop", as Professor Wenley sometimes calls him.
Not long ago an article appeared in the newspaper
to the effect that the noted scientist Camille Flam-
marion, claimed to have proof of messages from the
dead. The article inspired Dean Cooley as follows:
An Apostrophe
Wild flying fragments from afar,
Stray fledgeling from the parent star,
How wondrous is thy flaming flight!
What message dost thou bring tonight?
Art witness from the spirit realm,
Our doubts with proofs to overwhelm?
Hast knowledge which we seek in vain
Of happenings in that other reign,
That kingdom after this on earth,
The heaven told about from birth
Which comforts and brings peace in age?
When Charon at the landing stage
Is faintly seen with dimming eyes,
When mortal man as mortal dies?
O flying fragment from afar,
Dost message bring of gates ajar?
Of.pearly gates and streets of gold
Which entered meaneth peace untold?
Or bringest word of clanging bell
That opens wide the gates to hell?
O shooting star.
The Dean considers the above to be his best Mid-
Victorian specimen.
Then below, as Dean Cooley explains, is "one of
those pattern things that Amy Lowell delights in",
A Sunbeam, a Moth, and a Peacock
A sunbeam.
A prismatic beam shot through a crack
In the wall; a seam
Between two boards that were a wrack.
The sun was low
And on its way
At the end of the day.
And in the glow
Of the beam I saw
A moth.
A jeweled moth was flying slow.
It fluttered and turned
This way and that way.
In wondering awe
I watched the moth
Playing with the sunbeam,
And matching colors.
A peacock.
A pompous peacock spread his tail
And strutted; strutted
In the sun's ray.
The moth took slight
And flew away.
The sun set.
It was night.
To prove that he is still a practical engineer,
despite the foregoing, it may be said that Dean
Cooley was one of only five engineering professors
on the campus in 1881, while today he is Dean of
the flourishing School of Engineering and Archi-
tecture, with a teaching staff of more than one

hundred and sixty professors, assistant professors,
and instructors.
Way back in 1884 the Engineering Laboratory at
Michigan was a diminutive structure 24x36 feet,
built of wooden studs with bricks placed edgewise
and nailed to the studding. It cost the huge sum
of $1,500. Prof. Charles K. Adams, professor of
history, later president of Cornell University and
the University of Wisconsin, used to stop often on
the diagonal walk and speak to Prof. Cooley, when
he was in front of the little old laboratory and say:
"Well, Lieutenant, how is the scientific blacksmith
shop getting on this morning?" The same pro-
fessor used to remark that he thought it a "most
peculiar thing to have a blacksmith shop on the
campus of a classical university." The maligned
little building, after having bravely stood its ground
long enough to prove the practicability of erecting
the present Engineering Shops (which are being re-
placed by a still larger edifice) finally was moved
from the campus and placed alongside the cemetery,
but, as Dean Cooley characteristically adds, "not
yet in it."

smithing, Machine Shop, and Pattern Making turn-

The people of the
United States are today
confronted with their des-
tiny, and that destiny lies
in great measure on the
sea.
The young man of am-
bition has a different pic-
ture presented to him as
he goes out into the world
than had his father or his
grandfather before him.
For three-quarters of
a century the most attractive careers for each
rising generation lay at home. Ours was a coun-
try of boundless natural resources, of noble oppor-
tunities. There was no limit, other than a man's
ability, to what could be accomplished at home.
Our relations, both political and economic, with the
world abroad were extremely simple. There was
no economic demand that our people should go
down to the sea in ships, and hence we have had
no merchant marine worthy of the name. Having
no merchant marine to support and secure, our
Navy waned to a nominal force, largely composed
of old and obsolete ships. It was natural that this
should be so. There were no political or economic
reasons for maintaining a greater force.
As the country discovered and developed its
great natural resources and grew rich and prosper-
ous, men of vision here and there, all over the coun-
try, foresaw the need of securing our prosperity.
A start was made toward the creation of our
modern Navy. Men preached the need of develop-
ing merchant shipping to transport our products
throughout the world.
Progress was necessarily slow. Opportunity to
live comfortably ashore abounded, and men were
slow to earn their bread at sea.
The Spanish-American war, with its aftermath
of new interests and responsibilities, pushed on our
naval development. The manifest need of secur-
ing the Monroe Doctrine from the selfish assaults
of foreign powers continued the expansion of our
Navy.
The application of the Monroe Doctrine has suc-
cesfully safeguarded, for one hundred years, the

Its Past and Possibilities
By Warren M. Wells
TV/T USCLE SHOALS, the Niagara of the South,
■»*»-*- is on the Tennessee River near the city of
Florence in the northwestern corner of Alabama.
The Shoals (Little and Big Muscle Shoals) are
at a point where the Tennessee varies from about
one mile to one and one half miles in width, and
there is a fall of 135 feet in 35 miles, of which 100
feet is in 17 miles, with a curent of 15 to 20 milts
per hour.
The original work on Muscle Shoals was started
as a navigation problem in 1820-27 and additional
work, building and enlarging canals and locks, was
done in 1871 and again in 1895. This work was
never planned with enough vision of the future to
take care of the growth in river traffic of any long
period and there has, consequently, been almost a
continuous race to keep the canals and locks large
enough for the river boats, which were built to
handle the increasing traffic.
Developed for Production of Nitrates
In 1917 due to the price and possible difficulties
of obtaining Chile nitrate or nitrate of soda, (the
base of nitric acid and all modern explosives), it was
decided to build plants to obtain nitrates from the
air by processes which had been used in Germany
and Sweden for some years.
The latest process, The Haber Synthetic, was tried
out in Plant I, built by the General Chemical Co.,
on a 1,700-acre tract just west of Sheffield. This
plant cost $12,000,000, and, though chemically suc-
cessful, it was not a commercial success due to the
lack of proper material for the catalyzer ducts. It
was known that the Germans were passing air at
3,000 lbs. pressure through the catalyzer arcs giv-
ing a temperature of about 4,000-5,000 degrees in
the ducts, but the builders were unable to get
materials which would' stand this pressure and
temperature, and could use only 1,500 lbs. pressure
with a corresponding reduction in efficiency and
percentage of nitrogen obtained.
Plant 2 costing about $80,000,000 complete was
built by the Air Nitrates Corporation on a 2,200-
acre track just east of Sheffield. This plant used
the nitrogen fixation or cyanimid process which had
been used in this country by the American Cyan-
imid Co. for about 10 years. The American Cyan-
imid Co., however, had only used the process in the
Manufacture of "Ammo Phos", a trade-marked
fertilizer combination of ammonia and phosphoric
acid, and the process of producing nitric acid from
ammonia by the catalyzer arc and absorption tower
method was worked out while Plant 2 was under
construction.
This plant is about one-half mile wide and one
and one-half miles long and contains a liquid air
plant five times as large as any in the world. The
nitric tower group alone cost $7,000,000 and all of
the other plant buildings, about 70 in all, are on the
same gigantic scale. The plant has a rated capacity
of 40,000 tons of nitrogen or 110,000 tons of am-
monium nitrate per year and was in production in
nine months and twenty-six days from the start
of construction.
Recent news items have carried the information
that Germany is now independent of the world in
nitrate supplies, due to the 150,000-ton and 300,000-
ton Haber process nitrate plants built during the
war, and it is estimated that Plant 2 alone would
save the American farmer $50,000,000 to $75,000,000
yearly on his fertilizer bills if put' in operation.
The Development of Power Resources
Power for construction and operation of both
plants 1 and 2 was furnished by the Alabama Power
Co. from their 30,000 K. W. steam power plant at
Gorgas, Alabama, 88 miles from the Shoals. This
steam plant was increased to 60,000 K. W. by a
government owned addition, and a high voltage
transmission line was also built by the Government.
A $12,000,000 steam power plant of 135,000 boiler
horsepower capacity was built on the Tennessee
River in the No. 2 reservation, and this plant is
equipped with the largest turbo generator in the
world, of 60,000 K. W. capacity with ample room
for setting another similar generator which was
built for the government and is now in storage.
In connection with Plant No. 2, the Government
owns Waco Quarry, costing $1,400,000, located near
Russelville, Alabama, 35 miles from Plant No. 2.
Work.on Dam No. 2, or Wilson Dam, just east of
Florence and Plant No. 2, was started January 2,
1919, and up to date about $17,000,000 have been
spent and an appropriation of $7,500,000 is available
able for further work, which is progressing rapidly.
This Dam is 4,426 feet long, 135 feet above bed

rock, from 20 to 80 feet below bed rock, and 95
feet above low water. The river at this points runs
between limestone cliffs, 140 to 175 feet high, and,
although the dam will form a lake 16 miles long,
the flooded area will cost only $1,500,000.
The base of Wilson Dam is about 165 feet thick
and the superstructure will carry Wilson Dam
Highway, 45 feet wide. The dam will contain
enough concrete to build a two-foot sidewalk around
the world and is the largest mass of reinforced
concrete in the world.

Muscle Shoals Liquid Air Plant
As this is a "run of stream" dam with height or
head only equal to the river fall, there will be no
storage capacity and the rated capacity in horse-
power is quoted as 100,000 primary or year round,
250,000 for six to eight months, and 550,000 maxi-
mum. Electrical equipment will consist of four-
30,000 K. W. generators and fourteen 36,000 K. W.
generators.
Three locks in the canal around this dam will
have a total lift of 95 feet and will have lock space
35 feet wide by 300 feet long, which will allow for
ample increase in size of river boats.
Dam No. 1 at the foot of Pattons Island will cost
only $1,500,000 and is for navigation only, having a
15-foot raise lock.
Dam No. 3, on which work has not yet been start-
ed will be located 17 miles east of No. 2, and will be
6,665 Ieet long and about 50 feet high. It will flood
back 75 miles and the floodage rights cost will be
about $3,000,000 to $4,000,000. It will be a "storage"
dam in that its height takes care of more than
the 35-foot fall available, and besides being equipped
with 400,000 horsepower electrical equipment, it
will by storage increase the "primary" or year
around power at Dam No. 2 from 100,000 horse-
power to about 250,000 horsepower, and combined
with No. 2 will give about 950,000 maximum horse-
power.
The construction of additional dams for power
and storage purposes on the upper reaches of the
Tennessee will, by the storage of flood waters, in-
crease the "primary" or year around power available
at Dams No. 2 and No. 3, and, if equipped with
hydro electric power houses, will of course add their
bit to the grand maximum possible which is now
estimated at about 1,500,000 horsepower.
Muscle Shoals Is Ideally Located
The Tennessee Valley in the Muscle Shoals dis-
trict is probably the only place in the world where
iron ore, limestone for flux or fertilizer, bauxite for
aluminum, phosphate rock for fertilizer, asphalt
rock for road making, Georgia shale for potash,
dolomite for magnesium carbonate, coal, cotton,
and numerus other raw materials are closely
grouped with hydro electric power and with river
and railroad transportation available for handling
and distributing both raw materials and finished
products.
The saving to the farmer alone in freight bills
for shipping ordinary 12 and 14% fertilizer with
86-88% inert material or silica base goods will
amount to about $14,000,000, as the fertilizer which
can be made under the conditions obtaining at
Muscle Shoals will contain 45 to 75% plant food
to be reduced to ordinary strength by the addition
of base gods from each farmer's private sand pile.
To sum up the possibilities of the Niagara of the
South, Muscle Shoals, it is only necessary to call
your attention to the fact that, in this district with
1,000,000 cheap hydro-electric horsepower available,
with an employment possibility of one man per
horsepower, with virgin fields of raw materials for
a numbr of manufacturing lines, and river and rail-
road transportation well laid out, though at present
inadequate, we have as a basic housing equipment,
homes for only 20,000 people, the normal population
of the Tri-Cities.
This is the history and tfhe hopes of the $120,000,-
000 Muscle Shoals Project, which two years ago the
U. S. Congress decided to scrap as a "useless war-
time experiment" only to discover by the assistance
of Henry Ford's now famous bid, made July 8, 1921
that the United States Government possesses at
Muscle Shoals, a wealth of raw material and power
which will increase the wealth not only of the South,
but of the whole United States, giving employment
to 1,000,000 men and reducing the cost of food
throughout the United States by the manufacture
of fertilizers at a price which will induce increased
use and a resultant increased production per acre.


This Michigan Central Giant Brings Forth Many New
Features in Locomotive Design
A N EXTRAORDINARY locomotive, "No.
-*** 8000," which is expected to prove a most
important contribution to motive power progress,
has just been put in service on the Michigan Central
Railroad of the New York Central Lines.
Attracting widespread attention from the public
press, it has been popularly described as "the mys-
tery engine," because it was built in secret at the
Lima Locomotive Works at Lima, Ohio, and was
known to but a handful of men directly concerned
of proved worth, brought to the last degree of re-
finement for economy and efficiency. The engine
is of Mikado type, but contains numerous features
never before incorporated in any locomotive.
Locomotive 8000, in its preliminary tests and sub-
sequent daily service hauling heavy trains between
Detroit and Toledo, has performed in a way highly
satisfactory to the New York Central officials and
the Lima builders.
In its initial road test, it hauled 100 heavily laden

Engine 8000, the Most Powerful Locomotive for Its Size in the World
until it made its appearance ready for heavy freight
duty at Detroit a short time ago.
The new locomotive in general appearance pre-
sents striking departures from the familiar features
of the ordinary locomotive, and in numerous details
of its design and construction it is just as different
from any predecessor as its looks indicate.
The new locomotive was planned and constructed
under the personal direction of President A. H.
Smith of the New York Central Lines, who specified
the several most important main accomplishments
to be sought by the new design and made provi-
sion for the use of every up-to-date improvement

coal cars and later easily pulled a train of 140 cars
containing more than 9,000 tons of coal, indicating
a capacity of more than 150 cars and load in excess
of 12,000 tons.
A great stir was caused at Detroit when one
locomotive hauled thirteen box cars loaded with
stoves upon the opening of the Michigan Central
Belt Line, October 3, 1888, the contrast with the
performance of "8000" indicating the great strides
in motive power in the past thirty-four years.
Summed up, Locomotive 8000 is considered the
last word in efficiency and economy (in freight
motive power. These are its three principal merit
marks:

(1) For its weight, it will deliver more power
than an)- locomotive in the world.
(2) It will exert more tractive effort per ton of
coal consumed than any locomotive ever built.
(3) It will prove a locomotive easier to operate
and repair than its predecessors, this making for
quick turn-arounds and safety.
Locomotive 8000 was designed and built to ex-
pediate the movement of heavy fast freight trains,
such as refrigerator trains entrusted with perish-
ables. With an increase in weight of less than two
per cent as compared with the heaviest Mikados in
service on the Michigan Central, No. 8000 has an
increase of nearly eight per cent in tractive power
derived from the forward cylinders and an increase
of over 26 per cent when its locomotive "booster"
is cut in. The "booster" has the effect of turning
the trailer wheels into driving wheels.
New Type of Superheater Used
The designers of this locomotive in addition to
securing the greatest possible tractive effort with
a minimum weight at which strength would not be
sacrificed, incorporated the best known practices
and devices for securing economy in the use of fuel
and water. A superheater of new development has
been applied which produces a higher temperature

A Close-up View of "Booster"
of steam than the type of superheaters in gen-
eral use.
Until the invention of the "booster," the engine
trailer wheels have merely carried the weight of
the back end of the engine. The "booster" is an
auxiliary engine geared to the trailer axle and is
cut in and cut out either automatically or by the
engineer as the occasion requires. On Locomotive
8000 a tractive effort of 74,500 pounds is obtainable.
Of this figure 11,000 pounds are delivered by the
booster. The remaining 63,500 are obtained from
the forward cylinders.
Refinements in design and the use of alloy of
steel and hollow axles and crank pins have made
it possible to eliminate a great amount of weight
ordinarily necessary. The weight of the locomo-
tive, exclusive of tender, is 334,000 pounds. The
tender, which has a capacity of 10,000 gallons of
water and sixteen tons of coal, weighs 199,700
pounds. The boiler carries 200 pounds of steam.
The main cylinders are 28 inches in diameter, with
30 inch stroke. The diameter of the driving wheels
wheels is 63 inches.
For the first time in the history of American rail-
roading superheated steam is used to operate the
air pump, feed-water pump, booster engine and
headlight turbo-generator. Instead of the custom-
ary injector a feed-water pump takes the water
from the tender and forces it through a heater into
the boiler, the heat for the heater being obtained
from the exhaust steam, the condensate of which
is returned to the tender through a filter, which
eliminates any oil which may have been carried
over from the cylinders into the exhaust steam.
The feed-water heater is located at the front of
the engine, above the headlight and near the top
of the boiler, on a level above the top of the tank,
so as to give the condensate pipe line plenty of
fall to return the condensed water to the filter on
the rear of the tender. The feed-water pump is
mouned just back of the left side of the smoke-box
on the boiler.
Another important departure from standard
railway practice is the feature of superheating the
steam before it reaches the main throttle. In Loco-
motive 8000 the steam from the boiler passes
through the steam dome into the dry pipe and
thence to the superheater units, the dry pipe which
is outside of th boiler being connected at the
forward end direct to the superheater.
Before the steam leaves the dome it is passed
through a separator which collects any water that
may be carried in the steam, the water being auto-
matically returned to the boiler, which, together
with the taking of steam from the highest possible
point of boiler, insures absolutely dry steam of un-
usually high temperature. From the superheated
steam passages in the header, the superheated
steam is conveyed to the throttle, the location of
which is in what might be trmed a throttle box.
which is on top of the smoke-box and just forward
of the smoke stack, another unusual departure from
existing designs and practice and calculated to get
the steam to the cylinders from the throttle in the
most direct way possible.
Careful attention has been given to the applica-

tion of devices to facilitate handling the locomotive
by engine-men, the special equipment consisting
of power reverse gear, automatic stoker and an
automatic grate-shaking device which shortens the
time the engine must spend over ash pits. The
interior arrangement of the cab is such that the
engineer and fireman perform the necessary duties
in conection with the operation of the engine with
minimum of movement from their positions on
cither side of the cab, the physical effort of each
being practically nil. Even the blowing of the
whistle is pneumatically operated, an air valve
being located near the side of the cab and immedi-
ately in front of the engineer.
As is customary on the Michigan Central, the
engine is equipped with water scoop, which elim-
inates stops and consequent delays for taking water.
Locomotive 8000 has more than lived up to ex-
pectations in the short time it has been in service.
When it has been service a sufficient length of time
dynamometer tests will be taken and results very
definitely determined.

Our own governmental agencies are not so lily-
white in their incorruptibility as to warrant any
hurling of stones at our South American neighbors,
even where the naive methods of the latter make
our local gentry seem Machiavellian by comparison.
Yet no description of construction work in any for-
eign country is complete without some touch of
local color. For the engineer operating on the west
coast of South America the outstanding recollection
carried back to the States is the susceptibility of
the native official to proper encouragement. No
"awakened public conscience" holds him to the
paths of rectitude. Governmental sanction must
grace all the engineer's actions and whether it be
a concession for a tank site or the mere moving of
a buoy, there is a stipulated price to be paid the
Government. Then ensues heartbreaking delay,
while awaiting the official papers. It is not the duty
nor indeed the custom for construction engineers
to question too closely the demands made by local
authorities, whether these be made as officials or
as private citizens. Enough to say, the delay is not
infrequently terminated by a laconic entry in the
engineer's expense account, such as: "To the Port
Captain for reconsidering his previous decision to
move our mooring buoys into water too shallow
for our vessels, 6,000 pesos."

Dean Cooley is an authority in the appraisal of

felt in national engineering circles. Three years

highest honor which can be conferred upon an

By Prof. Arthur H. Blanchard
Professor of Highway Engineering and Highway
Transport, University of Michigan.
A N intimate relationship exists between the
&gt;**« elimination of traffic hazards and the efficient
design, construction and maintenance of highways.
A momentous responsibility rests on Federal, state,
county and municipal highway engineers constantly
to realize the public duty which is imposed upon
them to safeguard to the maximum extent the life
and property of persons using the highways.
In the field of municipal highway improvement,
more attention should be concentrated to relieve
congestion of traffic on city streets. The construc-
tion of ample widths of roadways, arterial diagonal
streets and circumferential streets will materially
assist in the relief of congestion of main traffic and
business streets in many cities. State and municipal
highway officials should cooperate in the routing of
through traffic around the business sections of large
cities and even outside the limits of small municipal-
ities. Marked relief from traffic congestion has re-
sulted wherever this fundamental principle of city
and town planning has been adopted. A detail of
street construction, often overlooked in many muni-
cipalities, which materially aids in the safe use of
streets is the construction of curb corners with the
longest radius practicable. With properly designed
curb corners, the tendency of motor vehicles, in
turning right-hand corners, to encroach upon the
left hand side of the roadway is materially reduced.
Accidents Due to Narrowness of Roads
Roadways should be constructed of widths that
will allow the safe passage of all classes of vehicles
utilizing a given highway. For a two-lane state
trunk highway, the paved width should not be less
than eighteen or twenty feet, depending upon the
traffic to which the highway will be subjected. Ser-
ious congestion is resulting on many trunk highways
due to the temporary parking of motor vehicles un-
dergoing repairs or stopping for brief intervals.
These obstructions on the roadway may be obviated
by the construction of five-foot shoulders of suffi-
cient strength to carry standing vehicles. Cases
have been noted where five vehicles within a dis-
tance of one mile on a highway outside of a muni-
cipality have been parked on the roadway under-
going repairs. This practice at night, especially in
the case of a vehicle without a tail light, constitutes
a serious source of danger. On narrow roadways,
fourteen to seventeen feet in width, the safety of
the traveling public may be increased by the mark-
ing of a center line on the pavement surface. Where
traffic demands a greater width than a two-lane
highway, the construction of a four-lane highway
thirty-six to forty feet in width is recommended.
Traffic hazards on curves may be materially re-
duced by constructing the curves with a long radius,
banking the roadway of the curves, constructing
an extra width of the pavement on the inside of
the curves, marking a center line on the pavements
and eliminating obstructions to view on the inside
of the curves. Right angle corners within distances
of each other of less than five hundred feet exist in
many localities. These may be classified as ultra-
dangerous traffic hazards and should be eliminated
by the construction of a long double reverse curve
in place of the two sharp curves and the intervening
short straight stretch of roadway.
In many cases, hill crests on highways consti-
tute as serious traffic hazards as sharp curves on
level stretches of highways. The tendency of many
motorists to travel in the center of the roadway
when no approaching traffic is observed has caused
many accidents at crests. A center line marked on
the pavement over the crest materially reduces this
traffic hazard.
Grade Crossings Need Much Consideration
Much can be done by proper design to reduce
traffic hazards in the case of railroads crossing high-
ways at grades. A clear sight of the railroad cross-
ing for five hundred feet on each side should be pro-
vided and a clear sight of the railroad for a thou-
sand feet on each of the highway is desirable. The
width of all roadways crossing railroads should be
at least twenty feet. For a distance of one hundred
feet on each side of the railroad, the grade of the
highway should be level or not over two feet rise
or fall in one hundred feet.
The field of highway maintenance provides many'
opportunities for reducing traffic hazards. Methods
should be employed which will reduce obstructions
to traffic to a minimum. Only one specific type of
roadway will be mentioned in connection with main-
tenance. Gravel roads abound in the middle west
and the excessive use of loose gravel has been the
cause of many accidents. These, together with the
dust nuisance, may be materially reduced by proper
maintenance.

Secretarv-Manager, American Wood-Preserving Association

One of the fun-
damental principles
underlying the prac-
tice of engineering
is a thorough under-
standing of the rela-
tive values of struc-
tural material. The
broad guaged, suc-
cessful engineer is
one who has no pre-
judices so far as ma-
terials, practices, or professional details are con-
cerned, but who extracts the best from all and ap-
plies it in a manner which will be most productive
under the conditions existing at the time of his
decision, and particularly as they may develop in
the future.
Timber was naturally the first material em-
ployed by man for construction purposes, and it
is today the most important and widely used of all
materials for this purpose. Wood has been and still
continues to be one of the greatest factors in the
advance and spread of civilization, and even the
engineer often does not realize the extent to which
it is used. Navigation, railroad construction, and
the development and use of the telephone and tele-
graph, electrical power, and many other important
industries of today have been and will continue to
be dependent to a large extent upon a regular
supply of high-grade timbers in various forms.
We are now cutting about 50 billion feet of tim-
ber annually in this country, of which over 40
billion are used for construction purposes. Light
weight, durability, strength, adaptability, and low
cost combine to make wood the ideal material for
construction. While all wood is not durable, it
can be made so by the proper use of a good wood
preservative, and there is a preservative and a
method of applying it suitable for practically every
need.
The preservative treatment of wood is almost
universally practiced in European countries, but in
America it has until recently been very greatly
neglected. Proofs are plentiful that the ancients
took special expedients to preserve their timbers
from decay. They had by observation and exper-
ience acquired practical knowledge of antiseptic
substances which made timber more durable. The
Greeks and Romans recognized the antiseptic value
I of essential oils for
preserving the wood
they used in build-
ings; the Britons
used to preserve the
wood in their war-
ships against decay;
and the Dutch early
learned the advan-
Itage of preserving
the timbers used in
the construction of
their dykes and marine structures.
Decay Caused by the Action of Fungi. .
Decay is the result of the action of certain low
forms of plant life called fungi consisting of very
fine, thread-like filaments which penetrate the wood
in all directions. Certain substances in the wood
constitute the food of the fungi, and as these sub-
stances are dissolved the structure is broken down
until the wood reaches the condition commonly
known as rotten.
The "seeds" of the fungi are so small that they
are able to float long distances in the air, and when
one drops into a crack or crevice in a piece of wood,
and conditions are favorable, it germinates and the
fungus begins its destructive action. Another way
in which decay spreads is by the fungi growing
from one piece of wood to another.
The four requirements for the growth of fungi,
or the decay of wood, are air, moisture, a favorable
temperature, and food. The wood itself supplies
the food. To prevent decay it is necessary to de-
prive the fungus of one or more of these four re-
quirements. It is out of the question in ordinary
situations to deprive it of air and warmth, and
though moisture can sometimes be eliminated to
a certain extent, this cannot be done when the wood
is exposed to the weather. In general, therefore, the
most effective method of preventing decay is to
poison the food supply; and upon this principle is
based the successful use of wood preservatives.
The preservation of wood has been practical
for centuries, but it was not until the early part of
the eighteenth century that the preservation of
wood by the injection of chemicals became scientific
in principle. Many materials have been used and
many methods tried to make wood resist decay,
insects, and marine borers, and out of the wealth
of experience, by the law of the survival of the

fittest, two preservatives have come to be consid-
ered as standard, while the majority have fallen by
the wayside.
Two Standard Preservatives Are Used
A good preservative must be toxic to wood-de-
stroying fungi. It must be of a uniform composition
suitable for penetrating the wood to the required
depth and of such a nature that it will stay in the
wood. It should in no way weaken the timber and
for apparent reasons a good preservative must be
available in large quantities and must be cheap.

Large Pressure Treating Cylinders
Coal-tar creosote and zinc chloride are the pre-
servatives most widely and successfully used.
Zinc chloride is a metallic salt, and coal-tar
creosote is an oil produced by the distillation of
coal tar. In order to establish trade standards and
to prevent adulteration, standard specifications have
been adopted, and the specifications of the Amer-
ican Wood-Preservers' Association, which are sim-
ilar to those of the American Railway Engineering
Association, and others, are consiered standard.
In 1856 the Vermont Central Railroad company
erected a plant to treat ties and bridge timbeis
with zinc chloride. About the same time the Rock
Island, Boston &amp; Albany and Erie railroad com-
panies erected similar plants. These met with but
partial success, principally because of the then
abundant timber supply and inexperience in treat-
ing timbers.
Modern timber preservation may be considered
as beginning in 1875, when a creosote plant was
erected at West Pascagoula, Miss., for the treat-
ment of timbers used by the Louisville &amp; Nashville
Railroad. About the same time a plant was built
at Slidell, La., by the New Orleans &amp; Northeastern
Railroad Company. All the timber used in the con-
struction of the bridge which spans Lake Pont-
chartrain was creosoted at this plant and is still in
sound condition after 40 years' service.
It is interesting to note that the first real at-
tempts in timber preservation were made not on
account of the security of timber, but because of
the high cost of replacing it. If the timbers in
the Lake Pontchartrain bridge had not been well
preserved it would have been necessary to remove
and replace them every few years, the expense of
which would have been prohibitive. Treated tim-
ber is the most economical material for a permanent
structure.
The demand for durable timbers greatly in-
creased, and the growth of wood preservation in
the United States since 1875 has been extra-
ordinary. In 1904 there were thirty-three Pressure
treating plants in operation, and about one-fourth
billion board feet of timber of various forms were
treated. In 1921 there were 122 plants in operation,
and over 2,400,000,000 board feet of timber were
treated.
Plant Equipment
A wood-preserving plant consists principally ot
one or more treating cylinders or retorts, six to
eight feet in diameter, about 120 to 150 feet long,
and capable of withstanding a working pressure
of 125 to 200 pounds per square inch. Inside the
cylinder is a track for the tram cars which carry
the wood to be treated. These cars, loaded with
timbeis to be treated, are handled in trains and
are run into the retort by small locomotives. The
cylinder door is then closed and after treatment the
cars with the treated timbers are removed and the
material is loaded for shipment. The treating cylin-
der is provided with heating coils to heat the pre-
servative, which penetrates the wood more readily
when hot.
In addition to the treating cylinder, there are
storage and measuring tanks for the preservative,
the necessary pressure and vacuum pumps, and
facilities for steaming the timber when necessary.
These plants treat with the standard preserva-
tives, which are, as has been mentioned above,
coal-tar creosote and zinc chloride. Creosote is
successfully and economically used for the treat-
ment of timber for all types of construction. Zinc
chloride is used for the treatment of timbers not
placed in extremely wet locations (such as marine
piling), for ties, mine timbers, and lumber for pur-
poses which usually is to be painted, or where the
odor or color of creosoted wood is objectionable
To be effective, the preservative must penetrate
the wood, and the commercial treatment of wood
is accomplished by the use of pressure. Impregna-

tion under pressure is the most satisfactory means
of injecting preservatives into wood, and while the
various pressure processes differ in details, the gen-
eral principle is the same in all cases. The essen-
tial feature of these processes is the use of pressure
to force the preservative into the wood. By this
means the penetration of the preservative is sub-
ject to control so that the amount of the preserva-
tive and the penetration may be varied to suit the
different requirements, and thus result in an econ-
omical use of preservatives.
The amount of coal-tar creosote injected ranges
from probably 5 or 6 to 22 or 24 pounds per cubic
foot, depending upon the kind of timber, the pro-
cess employed, and the proposed use of the timber.
In treating with zinc chloride the standard prac-
tice is to inject one-half pound of dry zinc chloride
per cubic foot of timber.
The pressure processes for the treatment of
wood are grouped into two classes: (1) Full-cell
process, the object of which is to fill the inter-
cellular spaces of the wood as completely as pos-
sible with the preservative, and (2) Empty-cell
process, the object of which is to secure as thorough
and deep a penetration as possible with the use of a
minimum quantity of preservative.
The Full-Cell Process
When the preservative used is creosote, the full-
cell treatment is known as the Bethell process;
when zinc chloride is used, as the Burnett process;
and when a mixture of zinc chloride and creosote is
used, as the Card process. In all these processes
the methods used are very much the same.
In the Bethell process the seasoned timber is
placed in the retort, a vacuum drawn, and without
first breaking the vacuum, the cylinder is com-
pletely filled with the preservative fluid. The
vacuum not only accelerates the entrance of the
preservative into the retort but also makes it pos-
sible to force the preservative into the timber more
quickly and with less pressure than is the case
when the preservative must displace or compress
the air in the wood. After the retort is filled,
additional preservative is forced into the cylinder
by means of pressure pumps, the pressure beinp;
gradually raised to, and maintained at, 125 to 17"
pounds per square inch at a temperature of about
180 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit until the required
amount of creosote has been forced into the wood.
The pressure is then released and the preservative
drawn from the cylinder.
With the full-cell or Bethel process, about 10
to 16 pounds of creosote oil per cubic foot of wood
treated is considered standard practice. For pro-
tection from marine borers, however, the oil is not
spared and frequently the wood is forced to take
all it will hold, or in some species of timber approx-
imately 18 to 24 pounds per cubic foot.
In the Burnett process the seasoned timber is
subjected to live steam at a pressure not over
twenty pounds per square inch for from one to
two hours. After steaming is completed, the con-
densed steam is drained and a vacuum of at least
22 inches is maintained until the wood is as dry and
as free from air as practicable. The zinc chloride
in the form of a two to three per cent solution is
run into the cylinder without first breaking the
vacuum until the cylinder is filled. Additional pre-
servative is forced into the cylinder and timber by
means of pressure pumps. The pressure is grad-
ually raised to a minimum of 125 pounds per square
inch at a temperature of from 130^degrees to about
180 degrees Fahrenheit until the required preserva-
tive is forced into the timber. After the cylinder
is emptied of the preserving solution a vacuum is
maintained until the material can be removed from
the cylinder free from dripping preservative. With
the Burnett process one-half pound of dry zinc
chloride per cubic foot of timber is considered stan-
dard practice.
In the Card process, the treatment is carried
on as in the Burnett process. The preservative is
a mixture of creosote and zinc chloride usually of
such proportion that the timbers receive an ab-
sorption of one-half pound of zinc chloride and

Treated Piling ox Cars After Removal from Treating
Cylinders
three pounds of creosote per cubic foot. The mix-
ture is made up of from 15 to 20 per cent of creo-
sote and the remainder a 3 to 6 per cent solution
of zinc chloride. During the treatment the temper-
ature of the preserving fluid is between 170 and

200 degrees Fahrenheit, with an average of at least
180 degrees, and the preservative is kept in a
mechanical mixture by the use of a centrifugal
pump attached to the treating cylinder.
The Empty-Cell Process
The Lowry and the Rueping are the standard
empty-cell processes. In these processes the creo-
sote is injected under pressure until refusal, or at

least until a deep and uniform penetration is ob-
tained, and then a portion of the free oil in the
wood cells is removed, leaving a final retention of
Lowry process a preliminary vacuum is not applied.
The creosote is pumped in and the pressure in-
creased until sufficient oil has been injected. The
pressure is then released, the oil drained from the
cylinder, and a quick final vacuum drawn. The air
naturally existing in the wood with the help of this
final vacuum forces out the excess oil after the
pressure period.
In the Rueping process a vacuum is not drawn
preliminary to admitting the oil, but, on the con-
trary, air is pumped into the cylinder and thus
into the wood under considerable pressure; then
while this air pressure is maintained, creosote oil
is pumped into the bottom of the cylinder. As the
oil enters, the air is gradually released from the
cylinder, but without allowing the pressure to drop.
In this way the cylinder is filled with oil but a
considerable quantity of air is entrapped in the
wood. More oil is now pumped in and the pressure
increased. This compresses the air within the wood
and forces the oil in on top of it. After sufficient
oil has been injected, pressure is released, the oil
drained from the cylinder, and a final vacuum
applied. This reduction in pressure allows the air
entrapped in the wood to expand and force some of
the oil out of the wood.
The above descriptions refer to air-seasoned
wood only. If air-seasoned material is not available
the timber is then seasoned in the treating cylinder
by steaming for the proper period, followed by a
vacuum. Only sound wood should be treated, and
while complete penetration of the wood is not neces-
sary, a deep, uniform penetration is desirable.
In most species of timber the heartwood is con-
siderably more durable than the sapwood, so if dur-
ability is desired and the timber used untreated,
pieces with little or no sapwood should be selected.
If the timber is to be treated, however, sapwood
limitations are not advisable, since the sapwood
takes the preservative treatment much more readily
than the heartwood. In southern pine especially
it is common practice to specify "85 per cent heart"
for timber to be used untreated. This is because
of the greater durability of the heartwood and not
because of any greater strength, as is frequently
erroneously supposed.
Treated Wood Is Economical
Wood preservative has added a new quality to
lumber which enhances its value and makes it ;i
real competitor, at a reasonable price, of those other
materials with which we have come to associate
the idea of permanence.
Well-treated wood can be regarded as a per-
manent material, and actual records of service
show that the life of well-treated timber can be
expected to be from at least twice to many times
the life of untreated timber, depending on its use.
Ties, when well treated, have an average life of
about twenty years under heavy traffic in the United
States, and generally fail because of wear rather
than decay; mine timbers treated with zinc chlor-
ide or with creosote are sound after fourteen years'
service in places where the average life of untreated
timbers is two years; creosoted piling is in good
condition in marine waters after 20 years' service,
where marine borers destroy untreated piling in
one to two years; treated poles and posts are in
good condition after 30 or 40 years' service; treated
timber highway bridges are free from decay and
in good condition after 20 or more years' service.
The economy of using treated wood block bridge
and factory floors and paving, when properly laid,
has been demonstrated after many years' use, and
entirely satisfactory results have been economically
obtained by the use of well-treated timbers for the
construction of bulkheads, docks, mills, warehouses,
factories, and other structures.
An official of one of the most important rail-
way systems, in a recent address, stated that 60
per cent of the ties used were treated sap pine and


Page 27

that a life of 20 years is being obtained—an increase
of from two years to twenty years—by proper treat-
ment. The economy of using treated wood, com-
pared with untreated material, is apparent to any-
one familiar with the results obtained by treatment,
but not all engineers appreciate the economy of
using well-treated wood when compared with other
materials generally regarded as permanent.
Treated timber structures, including bridges,
culverts, wharves, and buildings of various kinds,
are usually built in much shorter time and at ap-
proximately half the cost of structures of other
permanent materials, thereby effecting a consider-
able saving because of earlier use.
Treated Material Insures Long Service
Obsolescence as applied to bridges, wharven,
and other structures emphasizes one particular
value of treated timber which is of industrial im-
portance. Who can say what loads our highway
structures will have to bear and what widths will
be necessary in 15 or 20 years? The same question
applies to docks, terminals, and other structures.
With constantly changing traffic, shipping, and
other conditions, we cannot maintain the highest
efficiency by the use of structures which have beer,
rendered entirely inadequate by such changes. If
built of treated material they can readily be wid-
ened, lengthened, and strengthened at will, and if
necessary we can well afford to tear them down
and rebuild, since creosoted material has a decided
reclamation value, while if we have built of other
permanent material, which has cost twice as much
and which has no reclamation value, we cannot
afford to make the changes necesary to meet exist-
ing conditions, and proper development is likely to
be retarded.
The use of well-treated wood for structures of
various types insures long service with little or
no cost for maintenance, and because of its economy
treated timber is widely used as a construction
material.
COPPER
(Continued from Page 12)
of sliding around the drum, can be arranged to ac-
commodate a complete set of any desired shape of
mould. Each arm suports the trunnions of two
moulds. The complete casting wheel therefore com-
prises a central drum about 15 feet in diameter with
arms reaching out about 12 feet and carrying a ser-
ies of copper moulds, each of which has trunnions
on each end and a lug by means of which they are
supported in a horizontal position. The moulds
used in the casting-house under discussion are made
to mould a cake about 12 inches wide by 48 inches
long and 3 inches thick. The operator rotates the
casting wheel, bringing one mould after another
under the lip of the pouring ladle, tilts the ladle un-
til the mould is filled, and then brings the next
mould under the lip, casting a cake in about 45 sec-
onds. As the wheel revolves slowly the copper cools
and when half-way around the mould is automatical-
ly turned over onto a chain conveyor which carries
it up an incline into the rolling mill. As soon as the
cake has dropped from the mould, guides force the
mould back into its original position to receive a
new charge of copper. Another operator is sta-
tioned about three-quarters of the way around the
wheel and sprays the hot empty mould with a solu-
tion of bone ash and water. This bone ash has been
found most efficient in preventing the hot copper
from sticking to the mould.
Anod Rolling Mill
When the cakes of hot copper reach the top of the
incline conveyor they are inspected for heat and if
found hot enough for rolling are let run down an in-
cline roller conveyor into the first of four sets of
rolls. These rolls are about 15 inches in diameter
and of double 12 inch length. It might be well to
mention here that it is desired to roll these cakes in-
to sheets 12 inches wide by J4 inch thick, and finally
shear them into small sheets 12 x 20 x Vi inches. The
first two sets of rolls are driven by a 500 h. p. elec-
tric motor through the medium of a rope drive com-
prising a 48 inch rope spool on the motor shaft and
a 20 foot rope drive pulley on one of the roll shafts.
These ropes are about 1% inches in diameter and
are arranged on the English system where each rope
is independent. The third and fourth sets of rolls
are driven by a 500 h. p. Corliss engine through the
medium likewise of ropes. In passing through these
four sets of rolls the large cake of copper is reduced
to a strip 12 inches wide by some 30 to 40 feet long.
This sheet of copper is delivered by means of a me-
chanical conveyor into a bosh or trough of water in
which there are live rollers that carry the sheet of
copper to the first shear. The operator of this shear
cuts the long sheet into strips of about 8 feet in
length, piling them up until he has a pile about 24
inches high. Once the pile has reached the resired
height, it is taken to a gang shear where each sheet
is cut by one stroke of the shear into five or six
20-inch lengths. These 20-inch lengths are then de-
livered to a drop-hammer where four or five at a
time they are hammered reasonably flat and ready
to be prepared for the refinery.
The original method employed in arranging these
final sheets for the refinery involved hand labor en-
tirely. More recently a machine has been made

which eliminates a large number of the men former-
ly required. It is desired to place two of these
sheets one above the other with their long edges
horizontal and two long edges adjoined. To accom-
plish this strips of yellow pine 1 inch by J4 inch by
30 inches, with % inch grooves in one side, are em-
ployed as frames, one strip being placed on each
side, and since the groove runs only to within 6
inches of one end the resulting frame shows two
plates of copper, one above the other, with the top
of the wood strips flush with the edge of one of the
sheets and 6-inch legs extending beyond the edge
of the other sheet. These frames are stacked on
narrow-gauge flat cars about 3 feet by 8 feet long
and are ready to be transferred to the refinery.
Series Refinery
The series refinery comprises a number of groups
of tanks, each group being approximately 12 by 30
feet and divided into tanks 12 feet by 22 inches wide.
The tanks are made of heavy wood planking and
lined with a composition of asbestos and asphalt.
The partitions which divide the groups into small
tanks are made of brick and covered with the com-
position of asbestos and asphalt. This composition,
even at temperatures of 1200 which is maintained in
the electrolyte, resists the acid rather successfully.
It is necessary to spray these tanks with asphalt
paint frequently when the charges have been re-
moved and the tanks washed.
The frames of copper brought from the anode mill
are stacked in these tanks, one frame against an-
other, until the tank is full. When filled we find
a series of vertical frames, each containing two
sheets of copper 12x20x^4 inches and about one inch
apart. As soon as the tank is charged dilute sul-
phuric acid at a temperature of about 1200 is intro-
duced and the electric current turned on. The direct
electric current is introduced at one end and passes
through the electrolyte and successive sheets and
leaves at the other end. The copper is dissolved in
the electrolyte and caried in the direction of the cur-
rent from one sheet to the next; thus copper is dis-
solved from sheet number one and carried to the
near face of sheet number two, and so on from one
frame to the next in succession to the end. The dis-
solved copper that is carried from one sheet to the
next has lost practically all of the impurities that
have been listed and the deposit of copper that is
gradually built up is approximately 99.99% pure.
In about 14 days the line of demarkation between
the pure and impure copper has passed entirely
through each plate and the tank of copper has been
refined, except perhaps the small portions of the
plates protected by the wood strips on the ends. As
the copper is dissolved and re-deposited on the next
sheet, the impurities either go into solution in the
electrolyte or drop to the bottom of the tank in the
form of a slimy mud. The impurities which com-
monly go into solution are nickel, iron, arsenic, se-
lenium, telurium and sulphur. The other impurities
are included in the "slime."
The Electrolyte Must Circulate
It is necessary to keep the electrolyte circulating
continually to prevent polarization in the tanks, and
one finds the electrolyte pouring into the large group
tanks continually and overflowing into a lead-lined
trough which conveys it to lead-lined tanks where
it is heated to 120 or 1250 and again pumped back
into the system.
As soon as the line of demarkation between the re-
fined and unrefined copper has passed entirely
through the one-quarter inch sheet, the electrolyte
is drained from the tanks, the sheets flushed down
by a spray, and the frames removed by hand. These
are taken off as the frame is removed and ordinarily
may be used three or four times before they become
so brittle from immersion in the hot acid that they
will no longer stand handling. Yellow pine has been
found the best wood for this purpose as it will resist
the effect of acid longest. The copper of these sheets
as taken from the refinery is crystalline in structure
and therefore not malleable or ductile and cannot
be rolled into sheets or drawn into wire. It is taken
from the series refinery into the refined casting-
house where it meets the copper coming likewise
from the multiple refinery, and on being given spe-
cial treatment comes out as malleable and ductile
copper. A description of this treatment will be re-
served until the multiple process of refining has
been described.

Our Alaskan Resources
The greatest National interests at stake in Alas-
ka today are her timber and water power. Sooner
or later these resources will support a large paper
industry. Trade conditions since the war have
brought them into demand and given them com-
mercial value. It is within the power of the peo-
ple of the United States to create in Alaska a paper
industry as enduring as that of Norway or Sweden,
an industry which can furnish a million and a half
tons of paper yearly for all times to come, or a third
of the country's present consumption. For the first
time in our history we have an opportunity in
Alaska to develop the vast forests of a new region
as a permanent rather than a disappearing resource,
because the Nation owns them. However arid by
whomever Alaskan affairs are managed, that op-
portunity must not be lost.



The Engineering Laboratories
Progress on the construction of the new Engi-
neering Laboratories continues rapidly. The evap-
orator well which extends from the basement thru
the first floor in the north wing shows some inter-
esting features which can be observed during con-
struction. The well provides space for at least five
or six evaporators. Two balconies, to be used as
working platforms, are now in place. These are
constructed of six-inch I-beams on which will rest
subway gratings to provide walking space. This
will be built around the evaporators. A set of
rails for an overhead crane is also provided.
On the second floor of the north wing, provision
is made for placing of such apparatus as towers,
fractionating columns, and so forth, which will re-
quire more than the space between the two stories.
Above this section a portion of the third floor is
to be removable. Five 18-foot I-beams support a
brick floor which can be taken up and cut through
as desired. Whenever a still or column is built
which will be found to project through the third
floor, the section of floor immediately above can
be cut out and the apparatus run through. This
is now in the process of construction and presents
a unique idea which students will do well to in-
spect.
Physics Building
The construction of the first unit of the new
Physical Laboratory is now under way. The ex-
cavations were begun in the middle of the summer
and are now nearly complete. Those persons who
have watched the digging progress, have observed
with some wonder that the excavations were being
carried to an extraordinary depth. In fact the con-
crete footings of the building are being placed forty
feet below the ground level. It has not been neces-
sary to go to this depth to obtain a solid foundation.
The level of hard sand was reached some fifteen or
twenty feet below ground. The additional depth
is desirable because of the special needs of a phy-
sical laboratory. The low level of this unit is to
be carried to a depth of nearly forty feet. It is
hoped in this manner to obtain numerous rooms
in which the temperature will remain constant, and
rooms which will be free from noise and vibration
of walls and floors.
There are to be four stories above the ground,
and a basement, sub-basement, and second sub-
basement, or three stories, below the ground. The
building is to be of concrete and hollow tile and
have a brick facing.
The unit of the laboratory now under construc-
tion constitutes half of the laboratory which it is
hoped will be entirely complete within five years.
There are provisions of space, and plans made in
outline, for an eventual further extension should
this ever become a need.
The present unit is the unit which is to be de-
voted primarily to graduate courses and research.
Among the special features which it is to contain
is an X-ray room, and a sound room. In the sub-
basements are to be housed the engine for the ruling
of diffraction gratings, and various types of spectro-
scopes.
The New Field House
Our new athletic field house will be the greatest
single athletic building of the kind in the country,
and is ahead of everything of its type in construc-
tion, seating capacity, and general usefulness. It
is the paramount of all athletic buildings.
The new field house will be 342 feet long by 165
feet wide, and is being built on the east end of Ferry
Field, just south of the old field house. There will
be a possible seating capacity of 15,000. The seat-
ing will be distributed between four balconies, two
running down each side of the main room and stands
on the ground floor. The first balcony will seat
4,500 and the second, 3,500 persons. The remaining
(29)

seats will be supplied by movable stands on the main
floor. These stands must be movable because they
run out from the sides, leaving a space in the center
large enough for a basketball court, but covering
the floor so that there could be no indoor football
practice.
The main activities room will be 160 feet wide
and 300 feet long, which is just the size of a football
gridiron. Around the outer edge of this room is
an eighth-mile track twelve feet wide, and in the
center is room for a 75-yard straightaway. By open
sliding doors at the south end of the building, the
sprinters can have more space to finish longer
dashes. No decision has been made yet as to the
construction of the main floor, or how it will be
converted from a basketball court to a football grid-
iron. The room is clear of obstruction to the height
of 63 feet and the roof will be a great inverted V,
and a strip of glass 30 feet wide will run the length
of the roof on either side.
On the northern end of the building is a two-
story section. The first floor houses the offices, the
Varsity and visitors' lockers, and the main lobbies,
with a place to display all trophies. On the second
floor will be the storage, the laundry, drying, and
repair rooms, and a locker room with i,6oo lockers
and space for many more. Two other floors will
be built if needed. The completion of this building
will give ample facilities for all intercollegiate and
intramural athletics. This will allow Waterman
Gymnasium to be used entirely for physical educa-
tion.
This building will put Michigan in a position
to entertain other schools and colleges at large in-
door track meets, and will be an ideal place to hold
the Conference indoor track meet.
The New Educational Building
The new four-story Educational Building is
located on East University just south of South Uni-
versity avenue. At present the construction has
reached the second floor. The entire building will
not be put up at once, only the model high school
section is being built. The remaining section, which
will give more offices, class and laboratory rooms
to the University, will be added later.
The architecture of the building is of Gothic
type. The finish will be of grey stone and dull red
brick, such as used on the Library and the Martha
Cook Dormitory. The school fronts one hundred
seventy-three feet on East University and runs from
this street through to Haven. Most of the front of
the structure will be taken up by the library. This
room is two stories high with long and very fancy
windows running the height of the the two stories.
The school will accomodate five hundred pupils and
is equipped with a gymnasium, printing shop, ex-
ercize room, swimming tank, music room and lunch
room. Outside of high school rooms, a psycholog-
ical laboratory with seven adjacent examination
rooms is located on the fourth floor.
The Model High School is being built to teach
teachers, and at the same time it will give the
pupils the benefit of the very best educational facili-
ties.
New Infantry Officer Added to Staff of R.O.T.C.
Capt. Louisell graduated in 1915 from Alabama
Polytechnic Institute with a degree of A. B. While
there he was very prominent in all the major sports.
During the War he served as a second lieuten-
ant in the A. E. F. in France, with the 13th Machine
Gun Battalion of the 3rd U. S. Infantry, from Aug-
ust, 1917, until February of 1918. Later he was
transferred to the Tank Corps where he served until
February of 1919, taking part in the St. Michiel
offensive from September 9th to 17th. He was
wounded near Landras St. Georges while operating
a "tank" with the 2nd Division. From February,
1919, until September of that year Lieutenant
Louisell served with the Army of Occupation. He
graduated from the Infantry School at Camp Ben-
ning this year, coming to Michigan in September.
He received his captain's commission in July, 1920.
Under his supervision, the sophomores and juniors
will be given instruction in sketching and orders
and commands.
R.O.T.C. News
The R. O. T. C. units at Michigan will receive
this year a commutation from the government
sufficient to purchase uniforms of a distinctive type
for all men in the advanced courses. Last year the
commutation for the Sixth Corps area was given
to Wisconsin and this year Michigan is the recip-
ient.
The uniform consists of a blouse, trousers and
regulation cap. The blouse is cut similar to that
of the British army officer's. The color is a forest
green. It is hoped that the R. O. T. C. will now be
able to make a presentable appearance in parades
and ceremonies.
New Power House Equipment
In accordance with its custom of keeping up to
the minute on boiler room equipment the Univer-
sity slightly revised the furnaces in the Power


Page 31

House this fall. The sprung arches over the fire-
boxes of the Murphy Stoker-Wickes boiler settings
were due to come out and before starting to re-
build them bids were received from the various
companies manufacturing patented flat stoker
arcbes.
After some consideration the type known as the
Detrick Flat Suspended Arch was decided upon.
This arch consists of fire-clay tile which have in-
verted T-shaped grooves in the top so that they can
be hung from cast iron hangers. These cast iron
hangers are in turn suspended from structural steel
beams which rest on the side walls of the furnace.

A View of the New Murphy Stoker
With Murphy Stokers, such as those in the power
house, a side construction consisting of four or five
rows of tile, also hung by castings from the steel
beams, protect the coal magazines from the fire.
The entire arch is free to expand or contract and
does not produce the outward thrust exerted by a
sprung arch on the side walls. This saves the
trouble of tieing in the side walls with skew-backs
and tie-rods.
The big advantage claimed by the designers of
this arch is the ease with which it can be repaired.
It is extremely difficult to repair a sprung arch
because the arch cannot stand up with one brick
out. If a sprung arch is very badly burned it must
be entirely taken out and replaced by a new arch,
which can be built only by experienced brick-layers.
However, with the Detrick arch, the tile which are
badly burned, usually those toward the rear of the
furnace, can be removed and replaced with new
tile without disturbing the rest of the fire-arch.
As this can be done by boiler room labor, time and
cost of shut-down can be lessened.
Honor
An engineer is extremely jealous of his honor.
No matter how fortune treats or mistreats him, his
honor is his dearest possession. In his academic
training, honor is stressed above all other things.
At Michigan a system known as the honor system
of examination has been in vogue for some years.
The popularity of the system is testimonial to its
success. Under it the student engineer is considered
as a man of honor and not as a slinking crook. Are
the Michigan Engineers willing to uphold their re-
putation in years to come?
A Railroad Wreck
Probably due to the inefficiency of the track
walkers, a cracked rail went unnoticed and the
sturdy little locomotive U. of M. jumped its track.
It was on the morning of October 5th that the
University's own engine, hauling the University's
own coal on the University's own tracks, ran amuck
on this weakened rail, causing a damage of more
than five dollars. (Our friend Mr. Menefee would
have laid it to the fact that the load was too great
for the ultimate shearing stress). It leaped from the
rails and tore up approximately three feet of the
"Hand that feeds it," better known as the third rail.
For the benefit of those wdio arc not acquainted
with the U. of M. railroad, we might state that the
equipment of the railroad includes more than a mile
of track in addition to the electrically driven loco-
motive. The engine is an exact enlargement of the
"electric train" a certain Santa Claus brought us
some time ago. Its chief function is to convey
coal from the Michigan Central tracks to the power
house, and this is a very important function since
the B. T. U.'s it brings to the power house are the
very B. T. U.'s that keep us warm in our class-
rooms.
Survey of Michigan Clays
The department of Chemical Engineering is con-
ducting a study of the clays of Michigan, for the
State Geological Survey, to determine the economic
value of the known clay deposits thru out the state.
Fifteen or twenty years ago, there was a boom in
the clay products industries similar to the recent
boom in oil. However, due to unfavorable business
conditions, the boom fell thru and the State was
out-distanced by competitors in other states.
Recently the manufacturers in Michigan have re-
quested the State Geological Survey to make a study
of the known clay deposits for the purpose of
determining those available for industrial use.
The work in the Ch. E. Dept. is under the super-


November, 1922

TECHNIC

vision of G. G. Brown. The clays are sampled and
sent to the Dept. where they are tested, analyzed,
and burned to brick. The data found gives type
of clay best suited for various uses of brick. Some
types are found to be suitable for Portland cement
manufacture.
The work will take several years to complete, as
there are a very large number of clay deposits avail-
able.
The Engineering Society
The first general meeting of the Engineering So-
ciety was held October 17, at the Michigan Union.
Chairman C. A. Campbell of the Honor Committee
outlined the policies of the committee. Following
him, Prof. Anderson talked informally on the honor
system from the standpoint of the faculty. Richard
Krause, '24E, was elected vice-president of the So-
ciety to fill a vacancy in this office. Entertainment
was provided at various times during the evening
by the Social Committee.
Wanted—Engineer-Executives
"We desire the names of a few graduating
engineers of high standing. It is our intention to
fit them for executive positions in our firm."
Every year the Engineering Department receives
bids for its graduates, and through this means
places the greater part of the senior class in posi-
tions upon graduation. Among the letters recently
received was a novel one—from a large department
store firm in Milwaukee. Professor Anderson of
the Mechanical department looked into the matter.
The following facts, which show a new and growing
viewpoint of the value of an engineering training,
were brought to light.
Some five years ago the Sinister Stores of Mil-
waukee, a firm employing over seventeen hundred
employees, came to the conclusion that the desired
efficiency was not being obtained. They decided
to establish a department, the scope of which was
to be the treatmnt of problems of department
organization, turnover, and the like. For this
strictly non-technical work, they hired a mechanical
engineer of ten years experience, W. G. Retzloff,
who graduated from the University of Michigan
with a BaccaTatrecate Degree. They had decided
that a man with an analytic mind was what they
needed for the executive of this department; the
fact that he knew nothing of the department store
business was no impediment. This department was
built up, additional engineers were added to the
staff, and it soon grew into one of the most import-
ant departmetns of the firm. A present, a great
part of the important executive business of the firm
is done by engineers. The firm has found by its
experience that in most cases the man whose train-
ing has taught him merely the theory and details of
a business, is worth much less than the man who
has been taught to think and who has only to
master the details to become an excellent executive.
New Slow Setting Cement
A new method for the production of a cement
which is claimed to have substantial advantages
oven the forms of cement now in general use is re-
ported to the Department of Commerce by Consul
H. C. Clarbourne at Havre. The new process is
stated to have been invented in 1908 by the Societe
Anonyme des Chaux et Ciments de Lafarge et du
Teil. The product is claimed to be basically alum-
inous and is obtained by the melting down of a spe-
cific mixture of silex, alumina, iron and lime. It is
said that after much experimentation the Societe
has developed it beyond the experimental stage, and
in conjunction with the Societe Electro-Chemie et
Electro-Metallurgie has succeeded in the melting
of cement by an electric oven process, and that
these two companies are at present erecting, in the
province of Savany, a factory for the manufacture
of cement under the new formula.
It is stated that the cement by the new process
hardens very quickly, and that within twenty-four
hours it becomes harder than artificial cement with-
in a period of a month. Nevertheless, the fact that
it begins to set at the end of two hours and obtains
remarkable initial hardness at the end of four or
five hours, permits its classification as a slow-set-
ting body. A further advantage is stated to be its
immunity from decomposition on contact with sea
waters or sulphated waters. Likewise, the new ce-
ment, which is known as 'ciment fondu" (molten
cement), should be especially valuable in reinforced
concrete construction, by the reason of its high ini-

facturers claim that it will be very serviceable in
the manufacture of blocks of all kinds, more partic-
ularly of sea coast work carried on between tides,
as well as for interlinking and sealing places be-
tween disconnected bits of construction.

ALFRED NOBLE
1844-1914.
On March 15, 1922, the American Institute of
Consulting Engineers unveiled, in the main hall of
the United States Engineering Society's Building,
New York City, a memorial tablet to its Past Presi-
dent, Alfred Noble. This is the first instance of the
presentation of such a memorial by an engineering
society to one of its members.
This tablet was designed by the eminent sculp-
tor, Mr. Willard D. Paddock, of New York City.
It is cast in bronze, twenty-six inches wide and
forty inches high. The upper portion of the tablet
is inscribed as follows:
Alfred Noble
1844 to 1914
An upright man
A good citizen
An eminent engineer, whose life and
labors contributed greatly to the high
honor of his profession and to the suc-
cess of many important public works.
Below is shown, in relief, a bridge spanning a
river and, in the foreground, two structural workers.
On either side of the inscription are decorative pan-
els referring to the more important engineering
achievements in the life of Mr. Noble.
Following is a brief account of Mr. Noble's
prominent and useful career.
Alfred Noble was born in August, 1844, at
Lavonia, Wayne County, Michigan. At that time
Michigan had been a state only eight years, and
the country was but a sparsely settled region, in-
habited by pioneers. Sprung from the loins of such
a parentage, educated from the age of four in a dis-
trict school, from which, in due course, he passed
into and through a graded school at Plymouth in
the same state, possessed of the great advantage of
a good mother's watchful care (to which he acrcd-
ited much of his success), he passed his boyhood
days in the normal, practical, if exacting, routine
of farm life.
Volunteering his services in the Union Army,
upon his eighteenth birthday, and fighting with the
24th Regiment of his state through the heat of many
battles—not the least of which was Gettysburg, in
which three hundred of the four hundred and fifty
of his regiment were killed—Alfred Noble returned
to his father's farm in 1865, having seen something
of the world, and having satisfied his patrotism by
the gift of his services to his country.
Although respecting his farm work, he realized
that he had other duties to perform, and undertook
work in the War Department at Washington for
about a year. With money thus earned he entered
the sophomore class of the University of Michigan
and graduated three years later, having maintained
himself in college by work on the Great Lakes sur-
veys during vacations.
From 1870, for nine years, he gave his undivided
attention to the improvement of the Ste. Mary's
River and the creation of the lock at Sault St. Marie;
a great work. The details of the emptying culverts,
located under the floor of the lock, the gate hang-
ings, and the hydraulic operating machinery were
all new features. These have been in constant use
since 1881, and have worked satisfactorily. This
was his post-graduate course, completed in the hard
school of practical experience and conferring a dip-
loma recognized by the profession and the public.
From then on, Alfred Noble was sought by col-
league and by laymen.
We find him going to work on a bridge over the
Red River at Shreveport in 1882, and there quickly
followed the demand by the Northern Pacific Rail-
road for his services on its bridges.
In 1866 he built the bridge at Cairo, 11l., and in
1889, the great bridge at Memphis, over the Father
of Waters. All the time he kept in touch with the
work at the Sault Ste. Marie, and for the rest of
his life guided the development of the power re-
sources in the St. Mary's River. This knowledge
of hydraulics brought a demand for his services on
the Chicago Main Drainage Channel, and, in 1895,
Grover Cleveland called upon him for help in solv-
ing the problem of passage through the Isthmus
of Panama. Later McKinley, and then Roosevelt,
realizing the value of the advice to be given by this
well prepared and experienced man, placed their
faith in his judgment, which finally resulted in
bringing about a lock, instead of a sea level canal—

this in minority against many eminent European
and American engineers.
His country called upon him again—this time
to go to Hawaii on the Pearl Harbor Dock project,
The Canadian Government sought his aid for the
building of the Welland Canal; New York Statvi,
for counsel on the Barge Canal and New York City,
for advice on her water supply and transit; all as
Consulting Engineer of the Public Service of the
First District.
The Pennsylvania Railroad asked him to design
and supervise the tunnels under New York City
and the East River—and, in the midst of his activi-
ties, at the age of seventy years, Alfred Noble died.
Through all this activity, from school days,
through hardships of war and difficulties of the
assistant engineer, to the final problems oft he con-
sulting counsellor, there was the same modesty, in-
tegrity, honesty, love of fellow-men, keen sense of
responsibility, and ever present willingness to give
of his time, his knowledge and his money to those
who sought his aid.
AN ALUMNUS' ACCOUNT OF THE BURNING
OF THE S. S. CITY OF HONOLULU
Ralph R. Tinkham, '05E, a former editor of the
Technic, was among the passengers of the ill-fated
City of Honolulu, which burned last month on the
Pacific. He relates his unusual experience in the
following letter:
"Replying to your inquiry relative to my ex-
perience at the burning at sea of the S. S. City of
Honolulu, I am free to admit that the episode has
considerably more serious and interesting features
in retrospect than was the case at the time. The
"City of Honolulu" was a splendid ship of 17,000
tons, equipped well above the average of Pacific
shipping, for the convenience and comfort of passen-
gers, and providing excellent service. These facts
only add to the shock of realization that this fine
vessel has become another contribution to Davy
Jones' locker.
It was an hour before daylight when we were
driven from our quarters by the dense smoke of the
conflagration, which started in the stern of the ves-
sel, on one of the lower decks. For three hours we
watched on the upper decks confidently expecting
control and ultimate smothering of the fire, until
towards the last it became evident that the blaze
was creeping forward below decks and that the crew
and officers, who could not penetrate below the
main deck because of the smoke, were unable to
cope with the situation.
During this period tons of water had been poured
into the ship by the fire pumps, until finally she took
a sudden heavy list to port from this cause, and
proximity of the broken ports near the water line
threatened to flood the vessel with additional water,
as she rolled in the sea. Fortunately only a moderate
ground swell was running and ultimate capsizing
of the vessel from this cause was averted. The
pumps had stopped, however, and it was immedi-
ately imperative to abandon the ship. This was
accomplished in about three-quarters of an hour,
some difficulty being experienced in filling the life
boats on the port side, which, because of the heavy
list, had to be lowered into the surge of the sea
and entered by means of freely swinging rope lad-
ders hanging thirty-five feet from the rail. The
boats on the starboard side were filled at the rail and
lowered down the side of the ship. No casualties
resulted, although one officer and three of the crew
had been overcome with smoke and were revived
by a physician passenger who, himself, had escaped
in his pajamas through the port hole in his room.
One passenger fell from a broken rope ladder but
was not seriously injured. Some of the crew fell
overboard and were picked up.
We were eight hours in the life boats before
sighting the welcome smoke of the "West Faralon,"
a freighter, which came up unexpectedly. We had
expected to be in the boats until the following morn-
ing at least, when the army transport "Thomas"
was expected to arrive, as she did, eventually to
land us in San Pedro.
A great many of the crew and passengers suf-
fered from seasickness while in the small boats, but
otherwise there was little suffering aside from dis-
comfort, because of scanty clothing, close quarters,
and lack of drinking water. The spirit of all was
fine and, with few exceptions, there was little excite-
ment, the exceptions being among the men. Few
saved anything except here and there a little cloth-
ing, and mail, including registered pouches, was lost.
From the life boats, drifting with sea anchors,
we watched until three in the afternoon, an awe-
some spectacle as gradually the great ship receded
into black billows of smoke and sheets of roaring
flames, when we were picked up by the rescue
ship. The entire vessel was on fire as far as the
forepeak. Familiar as I am with the sea and with
ships, no part of the proceedings after the first un-
comfortable experience in the choking smoke while
reaching the decks, impressed me at the time as
unusually difficult or hazardous, fortified as we were
with the knowledge that assistance had been sum-
moned by radio. The excitement when taking to
the boats was suppressed by efforts in assisting
others less able, and it was only during the night
following, when endeavoring to snatch a few winks

curled up on the deck of the "Faralon," that relaxa-
tion and the "kick" of numerous bowls of black
coffee filled the minds of many of us with specula-
tions on what might have been. Fortunately the sea
was "smooth" for the ocean. A long easy swell was
running, which accounted for the epidemic of sea-
sickness, and only toward afternoon did it become
choppy from a rising breeze. What might have de-
veloped had we drifted in small boats all night is
only conjecture—probably nothing more serious
than extreme discomfort for women and children,
but good fortune attended us, and we all subscribed
to thanksgiving that we had reached hard ground
still able to breathe naturally and to navigate
on our feet."

THE NAVY'S RELATION TO
INDUSTRY
(Continued from Page 16)
pete for the business of the world, they must be
served by American ships. If they are served by
the ships of other nations, our competitors, they
must pay a toll to those foreign ships. If for a time,
in spite of that, they are successful, we cannot com-
plain if other nations who control the sea trans-
portation of the world meet our success by taking
advantage of such control to prevent our goods
from moving about the world with the necessary
precision as regards time, amount and place. We
must develop our own merchant marine. We can
and will develop our own merchant marine.
The history of the world can be analyzed and
resolved into a few fundamental principles. His-
tory invariably has repeated itself and will again.
No nation has ever built up a seaborne trade and
commerce unless the ships that served that trade
were supported and secured by an adequate naval
force.
Admiral Mahan, in his two great books entitled,
"The Influence of Seapower on History" and "The
Influence of Seapower on the French Revolution
and Empire," traces with matchless clarity the
political and commercial development of the Europe
we know today. Their contents are being applied
by the statesmen of Europe. The history of the
Japanese Empire in the past twenty-five years has
been substantially guided and influenced by their
existence. The principles adduced and analyzed
are particularly applicable to our own country, a
country that seeks wealth, prosperity and conse-
quent happiness, not by the sword, but rather by
honest, industrious labor.
We in the United States have been accustomed
to give little thought to our need for a merchant
marine, or, if we have considered it at all, only as
something seen dimly, in the distance. We have
been accustomed to think of our Navy as our strong
right arm, as our bulwark in time of war, but as
something in time of peace that was necessary, we
supposed, but still required a heavy expenditure of
the public funds that might be spent elsewhere to
more apparent and immediate advantage.
We must revise our ideas; we must renew our
perspective. The economic need for seapower is
upon us, and by seapower I mean a fleet of Ameri-
can owned, American manned ships, running from
great commercial ports to the ends of the world
and back, supported and secured by a Navy trained
to the razor edge of efficiency and second in power
to none other on earth.

RADIO PHONE RECEIVING
By Erich Hausmann, Sc D. 17 Ch., 178 pages.
D. Van Nostrand, $1.50.
This work is a practical, non-technical outline
of the essentials of radio receiving. The book is of
interest to the layman and student alike, in that
is it a skillfull blending of the romance of radio
development and the matter of fact and somewhat
prosaic subject of electricity.
Each of the chapters is written by a man of
eminence and note in the scientific world. The treat-
ment of the different subjects is lucid to the extreme
and manages to convey to the reader the idea of
practical application of the context without neces-
sitating the study or a thorough understanding of
the underlying principle.
To the more advanced enthusiast, the book con-
tains much of value, and can be utilized as a hand-
book or text on the subject of radio receiving.
MECHANICAL LABORATORY METHODS OF
TESTING MACHINES AND INSTRUMENTS.
By J. C. Smallwood, Associate Professor of
Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University.
Third edition, revised. D. Van Nostrand Co., New
York, 1922. Semi-flexible cloth 5 by jl/2 in., 423
pages, illustrations and diagrams, $3.50.
The purpose of this book is to bring before the
student the best methods of testing mechanical in-
struments and machines as studied in M. E. 7 and
M. E. 8. The book is divided into three sections,
the testing of instruments, the analysis of combus-
tion, and the testing of power plant units. The sec-
tion on combustion has been entirely rewritten in
the hope of making easier this difficult subject.
The volume also contains two excellent appendices,
the first of which is comprised of tables of logar-
ithms, steam tables, properties of ammonia, etc. The
second contains the A. S. M. E. code on definitions
and values.
AMERICAN MADE DRAWING
INSTRUMENTS
The C. F. Pease Company, 813 N. Franklin
Street, Chicago, Illinois, has just printed a drawing
instrument catalog which completely illustrates and
describes their line of American Made drawing in-
struments which are manufactured by them in their
Chicago factory.
The manufacture of American made drawing in-
struments developed, as a matter of necessity, in
this country during the war, and with the resump-

DAYLIGHT ILLUMINATION.
The angle of refraction being equal to the angle
of incident, it is a simple matter to determine the
correct angles to use in manufacturing glass whicj
will give good illumination. But for prspcr in-
dustrial plant illumination, there is more to be
considered than mere deflection of light. The
direct beam cf light must be eliminated in order
to prevent sun glare, which is objectionable on ac-
count of its causinj heavy shadows and strong
contrasts which decrease the efficiency of em-
ployees and necessitate the use of shades which
in turn reduce the light to such an extent that
daylight illumination any distance from the light
source is not sufficient. Therefore, in order to
produce a glass which when used in the window?
of industrial plants will produce as near to ideal
illumination as possible, we must first eliminate
the direct rays of the sun by deflecting the light
to the ceiling and side walls which re-deflect it
back to a distance 25 to 50 faet from the window
throughout the entire working area. To accom-
plish this we have scientifically designed a type
of glass which is named "Factrolite."
Factrolite consists of 30 ribs to the inch, run-
ning at right angles, forming 930 pyramidical
prisms or 3,600 light deflecting surfaces whic'i
completely disintegrate the direct beam of light
from the sun. Furthermore, the depressions in
the surface of Factrolite are so slight that the
accumulation of dirt and dust is minimized and
can be perfectly cleaned with an ordinary dry
scrubbing brush. Incidentally, the cleaning of
windows is most important for keeping up pro-
duction and increasing the efficiency of any in-
dustrial plant and should be given more considera-
tion in plant management.

through Factrolite, we will send you a copy e*

The First Article Published on Recently Invented Sea-Sounding Instruments Which Will
Mark a New Epoch in Safeguarding Ships at Sea
William Herbert Hobbs
Professor of Geology, University of Michigan
THE sea-sounding devices recently invented by Dr.
H. C. Hayes, the physicist of the United States
Navy Department, are likely to mark an epoch both
in the safeguarding of ships at sea and
m the advance of our knowledge of the earth. These
devices make use of the reflection of sound from the
sea-floor, a refined modification- of the hydrophone—
the so-called M. Y. hydrophone—being used to register
the sounds and their echoes.
Two distinct methods have been devised; the one
to determine relatively shallow depths of less than 100
fathoms, and the other capable of application to depths
from 80 fathoms up to and beyond the greatest known,
which are a little over six miles. These two devices
are somewhat different in principle. The simpler ap-
paratus, which is used in relatively shallow water, has
the sound which is to be registered sent out from a
point a measured distance away from the receiving
hydrophone, the noise being usually that of the pro-
peller received on a hydrophone located in the bow of
the vessel. The depth of water is here measured in
terms of the angle which the emergent sound ray
makes with the surface of the sea. The depth of water
is obtained by multiplying one-half the distance which
separates the propeller from the hydrophone by the
tangent of the angle of emergence of the sound ray,
to which must be added the draft of the vessel, since
the propeller and the hydrophone are near the level
of the keel (see fig. i).
It has been found in practice that reliable soundings
can be taken up to depths equal to about three times
the length of the vessel, and that the method gives re-
sults in depths up to 100 fathoms with an error of
about i fathom. If desired, the operator can keep the
propeller sounds centered continuously and thus have
a continuous sounding record, though this is not ne-
cessary since a sounding can be taken whenever de-
sired in about 10 seconds. The faster the vessel is
running, the easier it is to take a sounding by reason of
the louder propeller sounds, and reliable soundings have
been made on a destroyer running at a speed of 36
knots. The hills and valleys of the sea-bottom, readily
detected while proceeding at full speed, show many
bottom features which can be utilized to determine the
progress of a vessel or its position when traveling along
well-chartered routes. Rock ledges, precipitous coasts,
and icebergs all reflect the submarine sounds, and as a
result their direction and distance are ascertained by
sending out high-pitched submarine sound signals and
determining the direction of the echo and the time in-
terval between signal and echo. To a range of several
miles such 'location has been possible, though this is
hardly sufficient to safeguard the vessel against iceberg
dangers.
Vessels at Full Speed Detect Submarines
If a signal from a submarine sound beacon and a
radio signal at the same beacon are sent simultane-

ously, the range of the beacon can be determined by
measuring the time interval between the receipts of the
two signals. The direction of the beacon is at the
same time determined with great accuracy and such
signals can be picked up at great range.
The protection afforded to vessels by such an equip-
ment of sound appartus, makes it possible for them
to proceed with safety at full speed at all times, and
they can readily approach light vessels and harbors if
these are provided with submarine sound beacons. The
cost of equipping a vessel with such apparatus as is ne-

cessary, is moderate and more than offset by the sav-
ing of time it will effect.
For the deep seas the method of sounding is upon
a different principle. Here the sound is sent out from
the neighborhood of the receiver and the reflected ray
from the bottom returns close to the path of the inci-
dent one. In this case it is the time required for the
sound transit, and not the angle of emergence, which
is measured, and for this an extremely refined timing
device is required if accurate results are to be secured.
The principle of the method is, however, simple enough.
Sound travels in sea water at the rate of about 4,800
feet per second and the depth determined is one-half
the time in seconds multiplied by 4,800 feet. The dif-
ficulties of measuring the time interval with sufficient
precision and accuracy have all been met, so that the
error from this source is now reduced to about one-
tenth of one per cent, or 32 feet in case of the extreme
known depth. The deep-sea soundings, as well as those
in shallow seas may be carried out while the vessel is
in motion, for a sounding at extreme depth is made in
about 12 seconds, and for this time the forward motion
motion of the vessel does not introduce a sensible er-
ror.
In order to appreciate the advance which the in-
troduction of these methods is destined to make in our
knowledge of the sea-bottom, we must remember that
when, in the early '70's of the last century, the British
"Challenger'' carried out its famous series of deep-sea
soundings within the areas of the Atlantic, Pacific, and
southern oceans, about six hours was required for each
observation, and that a mass of metal weighing several
hundred pounds had to be left on the bottom each time
a sounding was made. Even with the improved sound-
ing device made by our own Admiral Sigsbee, in which
fine piano wire was employed in place of fibre, about
two hours were consumed in making the observation
and a weight of 50 pounds deposited upon the bottom.
Moreover, because of the drift of the vessel while car-
rying out the operation and the consequent inclination
and unknown sag of the sounding line, a large error
was always introduced.
Because of the expense in both time and money, the
topography of the ocean bottoms, save within a few
limited areas, has even to the present remained largely
unknown. This is notably true of the floor of the
Pacific, Indian, and southern oceans—a veritable terra
incognita. Now for the first time in history the prac-
ticability of securing a map of this vast unknown area
is assured, with promise of such a wealth of scientific
data of prime importance as to make the inventions of
Dr. Hayes rank very high among those which have ad-
vanced our science.
The new M. V. hydrophone being an essential part
of each of the sounding methods, will be described,
after which will follow an outline description of the
deep-sea method of sounding. All these description?
are based upon a series of articles by Dr. Hayes which
have appeared in the Marine Review, to which journal
we are indebted for permission to reproduce figure;
here used as illustrations.*
Description of the M. V. Hydrophone
The M. V. hydrophone is a multiple hydrophone
device consisting of two separate series of units which
are disposed systematically and parallel to the ship's
keel, as well as close to its level. These groups must
also be as far forward in the vessel as possible and
connected up to the water outside by a continuous wall
made up of liquid and solid materials, for any gaseous
layer would cushion the sounds. These receivers may
be mounted within the forward peak-tank of the vessel,
in a chamber of the double bottom if this is filled with
liquid, or outside the metal skin on the hull, where it
is necessary to protect them by stream-line blisters of
metal. In case they are set up within the vessel, the
two series of receivers are each enclosed in wooden
tubes as shown in figure 2 and an efficient sound screen

must separate the starboard from the port series. Such
a screen is usually made from thin felt or asbestos en-
closed within a water-tight metal covering. If the re-
ceivers are mounted outside the hull, its interior af-
fords sufficient insulation. From each group of receiv-
ers the electric leads go to the listening station, which
is generally located in the chart-house.
The construction of the M. Y. hydrophone is based
upon the binaural sense of perception, and for its pre-
cision and accuracy it depends upon the fact that with-
out special training the average person can detect a
difference of time in the arrival of the same sound at
his two ears to a hundred thousandth of a second. A
trained listener is able to determine this difference to a
five millionth of a second. When listening an animal
places the line joining the two ears at right angles to
the rays of sound.
How the M. V. hydrophone makes use of this "bin-
aural principle-' will now be explained. For the reason
that the time only, and not the intensity, of the sound
is here involved, a person partially deaf in one ear is
able to determine the direction of sound almost as
well as one with normal hearing. The precision of the
binaural sense is proportional to the distance which
separates the ears, a principle made use of in the M.
Y. hydrophone. If one does not turn his head to meet
a sound which comes from the right, his brain regis-
ters a sound in the right ear before it does the left.
If the ears are conceived to be movable, the one for-
ward or backward as the same rate that the other is
moved backward or forward, such a movement could
be adjusted so as to meet the sound at right angles and
synchronously at the two ears without the necessity of
turning the head. Such an adjustment as applied to
the M. V. hydrophone is referred to as compensation,
and that part of the instrument which makes the ad-
justment is known as the compensator When the
compensator has been adjusted in this manner all
sounds except those coming fiom its adjusted front r.re
largely focused out, and if the human head were pro-
vided with such a compensator in the movement of the
ears, one might easily converse without interference at
a great reception.
For each ear the M. V. hydrophone adds a battery
of individual hydrophones synchronized to phase and
magnifying by the number of hydrophones in the bat-
tery those particular sounds which are selected from
the existing sound complex.
In the M. V. hydrophone the battery of six receiv-
ers at the left, which are numbered from 1 to 6, are
all connected up to the left ear of the telephone head-
piece of the listener; the corresponding battery to the
right, which is numbered from 7 to 12, being in similar
manner connected up to the right ear of the head-piece.
All twelve receivers are connected up in parallel to a
battery and switch, and each receiver in the circuit
contains the primary coil of a small transformer, which
prevents the direct current from the battery from pass-
ing through to the telephone receivers.
The compensator of the hydrophone consists of a
series of extended coils each provided with an adjust-
able take-off for the induced current, and these take-
offs are also adjustable in such a manner that the lags
brought about in the receivers of one receiver battery
and the accelerations upon those of the other, shall be
made to correspond to any desired wave-front of the
incident sound selected. When the compensator has
been so adjusted, a sound is received by the two ears
in unison, just as though in the case of no compensa-
tion the waves were parallel to the front line of the
receivers. All undesired sounds are thus very largely
"focussed out", and the intensity of the sound desired
is magnified six times by the battery of receivers.
The compensator case has openings in the form of
windows, through which movable scales permit of read-
ing directly the bearing of the sound ray either to star-

tions of port and starboard receiver lines and intervening

board or to port, as the case may be; and another scale
permits of reading directly the depth of water as de-
termined from the angle of emergence of the sound
ray which has been reflected from the bottom.
Deep-Sea Sounding Requires Great Accuracy
For deep-sea sounding, in which the time of sound
transit to the bottom and back is the basis of the depth
determined, a special timing device of great precision is
a necessary part of the sonic depth-finder. A stop-
watch is here of no value, for one-fifth of a second of
error in determining the time corresponds to an error

How the Explosive Used in Blasting Caps and
Electric Blasting Caps is Manufactured
FULMINATE of mercury is a
gray or white powder, very
line and usually stored and handled
under water on account of its ex-
tremely explosive nature. It was
discovered in 1799 by Howard but
considerable time passed before any
investigation of its properties or
composition was made. This was
tempted to realize queer theories
and fantastical hypotheses. Howard
allowed nitric acid to act upon red
oxide of mercury mixed with alco-
hol and in place of the compound he
expected to attain, he found a white,
crystalline salt which detonated
with great violence. The first prac-
tical test of this compound in the

due to the highly explosive nature
of the compound. The first actual
determination of its composition
was made by Liebig, in Gay Lus-
sac, and additional work was done
by Wohler and Berzelius, but the
ultimate analysis was made by Ke-
kule.
Like very many important dis-
coveries which have marked epochs
in science, the discovery of fulmin-
ate of mercury was a fortunate ac-
cident. Its discovery arose from a
series of experiments which at-
explosive industry was made by an
English gunsmith in 1815, when he
utilized its extremely sensitive na-
ture for the manufacture of percus-
sion caps for guns. These caps were
used to ignite the black powder m
the gun in place of the old flint locks
used up to this time. The actual
invention of these percussion caps
is apparently due to Joseph Egg.
The sensitiveness of fulminate of
mercury makes accidents in its use
comparatively frequent and conse-
quently many attempts have been
made to replace it with some other
compound, but, nevertheless, it is
the most widely used material of
this nature in practice at the pres-
ent time.
By far the greatest consumption
of fulminate of mercury is in the
preparation of blasting caps, both
common caps and electrical caps,
used for exploding commercial
dynamite.

rels, is first siphoned by a hose into a

Charging thk Crocks
The cans arc placed as rapidly as possible on the rim of the crocks, the alco-
hol runs in, and the reaction starts immediately.
The Prescott Plant of the Her-
cules Powder Company, where ful-
minate of mercury is made, is lo-
cated on the outskirts of the town
of Prescott, Ontaria, Canada, on
the St. Lawrence River, directly
opposite Ogdensburg, N. Y. It
was built about 1885, and was
owned successively by several dif-
ferent explosive firms, but it was
always under the supervision of the
late F. K. Brewster. When the
Aetna Explosives Co., Inc., was ab-
sorbed by the Hercules Company
last year, this plant passed into con-
trol of that company.
The Prescott Plant manufactures
nothing but fulminate of mercury
for shipment to the blasting cap and
electric blasting cap plant at Port
Kwcn, \T. Y. Since the Prescott
Plant is able to supply the needs of
the Port Ewen plant by operating
only three or four months each
year, operation is confined to the
most suitable months as far as
weather is concerned.
The plant consists of a number
of warehouses for storing the raw
material and an open yard for the
actual manufacture. This yard is
equipped with a narrow-gauge
tram-track and contains one hun-
dred small handcars, on each of
which are placed twenty glazed
earthen-ware crocks.
Only three ingredients are requir-
ed for the manufacture of fulmin-
ate of mercury, namely: water-

The complete cycle of operations
is as follows: The empty crocks
on the small cars are first taken to
the acid stand where men with glass
measuring pitchers dip one gal-
lon of acid from the large storage
tanks and pour it into each crock.
The cars then proceed to the next
stand where a man pours about
three-quarters of a pourd of mer-
cury into each crock, the mercury
having been previously measured
into graduated glasses from the
seventy-five-pound flasks in which
it is received. The cars are then
pushed out into the open yard and
allowed to stand for two hours,
■vhich is a sufficient length of time
for the mercury to be dissolved by
the nitric acid. At this point the
alcohol, which has been previously
put into the cans, is poured into the
crocks, a sufficient number of men
being utilized in this operation so
that the entire operation of handl-
ing the two thousand cans of

the contents of each can to run
out.
About five minutes after the al-
cohol has been put into the crocks
chemical action starts and within
another five minutes a considerable
crude fulminate and waste acid runs
into cloth-lined filter boxes which,
when full, are placed on a filter
stand, and clear, cold water is run
through them until all traces of
the acid have been eliminated.

quantity of fume is being given off.
This fuming continues violcnily for
about fgrfy-five minutes and dis-
appears at the end of an hour and
a half. After another half hour
the fulminate of mercury precip-
itates to the bottom of each crock
and the waste acids above are suf-
ficiently cooled.
On account of the poise-nous na-
ture of the fumes, this operation,
as stated above, is conducted in the
open and during the period of fum-
ing all operators move off to a suit-
able distance. This is why a large
force of men and rapid operation
are necessary in filling each crock
with alcohol as near the same time
as possible. The men do not have
to work in the fumes from some
crocks while filling others.
The cars are then pushed to the
wash-stand and the crocks inverted
over rubber-lined boxes so that
they can be washed out with an or-
dinary hose. From these boxes the
ed to become dry, since fulminate
when dry is far more sensitive to
rough treatment than when wet;
the danger of explosion is conse-
quently very much reduced.
The plant has a capacity of about
five thousand pounds of fulminate
of mercury per day.
Fulminate of mercurv is mixed
with chlorate of potash at the Port
Ewen cap plant to form the mix-
ture used for blasting caps. This
mixture is more efficient in detonat-
ing commercial explosives than is
fulminate of mercury alone. It is
forced into copper capsules by a
press, forming either common blast-
ing caps, or, if a bridge wire of plat-
inum alloy is inserted, electric
blasting caps.

Armstrong College, New-Castle-
on-Tyne, has been equipped with a
new testing machine for bending

Washing Fulminate Free frum Acid
The fulminate of mercury in these cloth-lined filters is washed with a spray
of cold water until the very last traces of acid are removed.
When the fulminate is neutraliz-
ed, is it packed wet in double cloth
bags, which in turn are packed in
sawdust and water in wooden bar-
rels. At no time during the process
is the fulminate of mercurv allow-

with a maximum width of 4 feet,
can be handled in this machine. In
previous testing machines the width
of the member that could be ac-
commodated was but a few inches.

MANY theories have been advanced to account
for the formation of asbestos but geologists
in general concur in believing that the origin is vol-
canic and took place during the prehistoric cooling
of the earth's surface and that either water or steam is
responsible for the breaking apart of the original rock
formation and its rebuilding under pressure into its
present fibrous state.
While the ancients are said to have used asbestos
as shrouds for the cremation of their kings and as
wicks to keep the oil filled lamps of their sanctuaries
burning with practically no attention, for centuries,
asbestos was mainly a curiosity. A solid rock, yet com-
posed of thread-like fibres so rugged in themselves that
the millions of years of earth cooling, hardening and
cracking did not break the slender threads.
To look upon a bunch of asbestos fibres one would
think it would blaze up at the touch of a lighted
match or dissolve when brought in contact with acids
yet it resists highest temperatures and practically all
commercial acids, the wear and tear of friction and
the elements. While the rock itself is heavy yet these
yarns can be woven into cloth weighing less than 16
ounces to the square yard. The length of the fibres
themselves range from a fraction of an inch to four
and one-half inches.
The word asbestos is derived from the Greek mean-
ing unquenchable which may be stretched to mean in-
consumable or incombustible. The two principal var-
ieties of the mineral are known as Chrysotile and Am-
phibole asbestos and vary in color from pure white to
yellow, pink, green, blue, brown and many intermediate
and mottled shades. The chief constituents of these
two types are silica, magnesia, alumina and ferrous
oxide and their specific gravities vary from 2.5 to 3.02.
The essential difference between the Amphibole and
Chrysotile asbestos is the amount and condition of
the water present. The former contains about five per
cent of chemically combined water and is good for re-
sisting high temperatures, thus its exceedingly brittle
fibres prohibit its use for weaving or spinning purposes.
This type is usually ground up and formed into a paste
and used in connection with heat insulating materials
and heat resisting compounds. The latter is what is
known as the fibre of commerce and contains from 12
to 15 per cent of water in combination with other con-
stituents.
American asbestos is found in 16 different states
and the greater part comes from Arizona, California
and Maryland. The finding of valuable deposits of
asbestos in the Province of Quebec, Canada, greatly en-
hanced the asbestos industry and has brought it to
where it is today. Canadian fibre is of the Crysotile
variety and is now recognized as one of the most es-
sential commodities in the industrial market of the
world, an industry, however, which by no means has
yet reached the height of its development for new ap-
plications of asbestos are being sought and found con-
stantly.
Canada Furnishes Large Part of Supply
More than three-fourths of the world's supply of
Asbestos is derived from Canada where it occurs in a
relatively narrow zone extending from about 40 miles
south of Quebec to a short distance across the United
States border. Its commercial extraction in this zone
is only possible at certain localities among which the
principal ones are Thetford, Black Lake, East Brough-
ton and Danville.
The largest mine in the Danville District is that of
Johns-Mansville, Inc., which covers about 500 acres.
The outcropping of Asbestos Rock so far developed at
this mine covers about 100 acres and the main quarry
is 1500 ft. long, 600 ft. wide and 200 ft. deep. As prac-
tically the whole mass of rock has to be mined the
operations arc carried on in open pits or quarries. In
view of this fact it will be readily understood what dif-
ficulties are encountered during the winter months.
Due to the severe weather conditions there is very little
production during the months of December, January
and February.
These mines are operated practically in the same
way as stone quarries, the operations being carred on
by a series of steps or benches which enable the miners
to dislodge large quantities of rock at each blast. The
rock is so hard that it is necessary for it all to be drilled
and blasted. The operation is mammoth and practic-
ally assumes the proportions of the moving of a large
mountain.
Asbestos today is an industrial, architectural and
domestic necessity in the strictest interpretation of that
word. There is no substitute.for it. No other known
material possesses the inherent fire resistance, dur-
ability and adaptability of asbestos. It can be woven,
spun, pressed, matted, molded, in fact made up in al-
most any form either alone or in combination with
other materials to produce the desired results. What
is very important it readily combines with almost any

material because it offers no chemical or physical
reaction.
One of the most important results of the develop-
ment of asbestos has been the saving of heat through
insulation, insultations that retard the escape of heat
from boilers, furnaces, pipes, flues and other flat sur-
faces.
In addition to the saving of heat units in boilers,
pipe lines, etc., asbestos is indispensable in the factory
and power plant in the form of packing for all kinds of
rods, pistons, plungers, air brake cylinders and flanges
packing against steam, water, air, brine, ammonia, oil.
gasoline, acids and alkalies. It is invaluable as con-
veyor belts for handling hot slag cinders and other

materials requiring fireproof fabric. In this connec-
tion, it finds employment in helmets, aprons, coats, leg-
gings and other wearing apparel for the protection of
workmen, in foundries, steel mills and glass works
where molten metals and glass are a constant source of
danger to life. Asbestos is made into a tape as thin as
.025 inch thick and also made up into braided tubing to
use as a protective fireproof covering for conductor
wires, cables, armature windings, field coils, etc., to
prevent the spread of flame in case of short circuit.
It is made up into cord, twines, yarns, rope, paper and
mill board for conditions where metal or organic mate-
rials would be quickly destroyed by the attacks of heat
or acids. It is used extensively as a filter and as lin-
ings in stoves.
In the automobile field we find a very wide adap-
tion for asbestos. In addition to the conditions al-
readv enumerated it is used in wood form or insu-
lation form for the construction of enameling ovens
and in places requiring strong fire and acid proof mate-
rials. In automobiles it is used as a gasketing mate-
rial for cylinder heads and intake and exhaust mani-
folds; as spark plug packing, for clutch facings and
protective tubing for electric wiring and in some cases
in the manufacture of tire fabric but its greatest use
in the operation of automobiles is as brake band lin-
ing, the production of which is approximately 50 mil-
lion feet per year. The longest fibres are required for
brake band lining and textiles, and on account of its
high coefficient of friction and resistance to heat and
wear it is also chosen for brake drums on hoisting
engine cranes and like apparatus.
Asbestos gets into the home in the form of insula-
tion for furnaces, steam and hot water pipes, hot air
ducts and stove lining, as table covers, table mats, flat
iron holders, rests and fibre for gas logs, fireproof
material for ceilings, walls, partitions, baseboards and
as stucco or roofing for the outside. In fact, there is
no end to the uses of asbestos in the home. Asbestos
lumber for fireproofing and asbestos shingles for roof-
ing has made for the architect and engineer safer and
better construction in buildings.
Asbestos in combination with Portland cement
forms several of the lines of manufacture. The fibre
and Portland cement form insulating materials when
mixed with water and pasted to surface or flange, etc.
When mixed with water in a mass and hydraulicallv
compressed under great pressure it is made into as-
bestos lumber and asbestos shingles.
Asbestos is Used Extensively in Theatres
Even in the theatre asbestos is absolutely essential.
Jn the curtain it serves as an armor against tire and the
danger of backdraft. Scenery is made from asbestos
and the lights both in the theatre and home are ener-
gized from distant generators through a system safe-
guarded by this same material. In the moving picture
theatre, which today is a recognized part of our
social life, the patrons arc protected from the spread
of fire from the inflammable film by an asbestos wood
projecting booth. At the warehouses of the film dis-
tributors these highly inflammable films are stored in
racks and cabinets made of asbestos wood.
Very recently at Signal Hill, Southern California's
newest oil field, broke into the daily news by having
the only well in the world that ever blew out its cement
plug and the only well ablaze ever attacked by men
wearing asbestos suits, carrying asbestos wrapped
dynamite to its flaming brink. Incidentally these men
were able to extinguish the flaming well, which would
have been impossible but for the use of asbestos.
Thus we find that the mysterious rock of the an-
cients which was supposed to have been made from
the skin of a salamander is today doing service sav-
ing many thousands of dollars in various ways.


Relating to the Evolution of Air Craft, Their Proven Value in War and Great
Commercial Possibilities

|_j' OR 1S00 years man used horse travel as his meas-
■*&gt; ure of rapid transit for land distance and the sail-
ing ship with which to calibrate speed on water routes.
Except for an infinitesimal extension of improved
roads, no substantial betterment was made in the time

poleon could not have reached Rome any more quickly
than Caesar could bave journeyed to Paris. From gen-
eration to generation these same standards were hand-
Just one hundred years have passed since then and

less demonstrations of its practicability that have caus-
ed the people of all civilized countries to accept it as an
essential and necessary part of their scheme of life.
Improvements in equipment have brought increases in

ed down until they must have assumed in the public
mind the permanent character of time itself. They
were the twelve inch rules of rapid transit.
And then about 1823 Stephenson built "The Rock-
et" and shocked the world's intelligence by presenting a
new travel yardstick that turned the four to six miles
of the horse into eight to twelve miles of the locomo-
tive. History gives abundant evidence of the resistance
to this new mode of travel in the earlier stages of its
development, but when its real usefulness and safety
had been proven, however, the flood of sentiment in
its favor was so overwhelming as to earn the title of
"railway mania" for the extensive programs of con-
struction in the leading countries.
earned its right to permanently supplant the horse as
the measure of rapid travel along its own right of way.
All railways, whether they be steam, electric or
cable, possess the same limitation of immobility. Their
sphere of action is determined by their right of way.
They are dependent upon the business that is created
adjacent to their lines, or that is brought to them. In
this respect they may be likened to an animal tethered
in a pasture. It has a certain area to feed and roam
over at will that is limited by the length of it's rope.
The contents of any other area are beyond its reach
unless brought to it by outside means.

make its first serious bid for public attention. Re-

garded initially as a rich man's plaything and as largely
impractical in countries of wide climatic variations and
where hub-deep mud prevailed for months at a time,
it nevertheless intrigued the imagination. If it could
be made reliable and cheap, and if there could be good
roads to run on—then would it, in effect, give every
man a private railroad from his own door to that of
every other man. Slowly, at the start, but with in-
creasing momentum as its advantages to the individual
became more generally known, the motor vehicle has
in a single generation lifted the individuals of our
country bodily into another new and still further im-
proved relationship. Isolation has been taken from
the farm and city alike, and the privileges of each made
available to the other. One hour's distance from the
doctor, school, market, railroad, grocery, church or
neighbor's dinner table, that used to mean four to six
miles by the yardstick of horse travel, has been in-
creased to twenty-five or thirty miles by the automobile.
For centuries the average human being has had a
rope of limitation in common with the tethered animal.
Transportation by horse set a definite and inescapable
limit upon his sphere of action. The hour of travel
yielded so little in distance that his points of business
contact, his opportunities, and consequently his accom-
plishments, were in large measure determined by the
standard of his horse transportation.
There is a direct relation betwen the standards of

transportation of any country and the degree of ad-
vance in its intellectual development. Higher educa-
tion demands improved facilities, while more ready
means of travel and communication greatly increases
the opportunities of the individual for the enjoyment
of all that is worth while in life. It is interesting to
note that every form of transportation that was ever
devised exists somewhere—even down to the ox-cart
and to man as a common carrier. No one form has
displaced all other forms, nor is it likely that one ever
will until the whole human race has attained a uni-
form civilization.
Orville Wright, in a biplane designed and construct-
ed by his brother Wilbur and himself, equipped with
a 16 h. p. motor, also of their design and construction,
made the first successful flight in a motor driven fly-
ing craft on December 17, 1903—12 sec., at 30 to 35
miles an hour.
Thus was started another era in rapid transit and
the first successful conquest of the air. Eighteen years
later, during 1921, nearly a quarter of a million peo-
ple in the United States tested this new measure of
distance that air travel affords.
The World War gave to aviation the first sub-
stantial recognition of its importance. It went in as an
unimportant non-combatant observer. It emerged not
only as the eye of army and navy, and essential to all
surface operations, but also as an entirely new force
for offense and defense with power to augment or
nullify surface actions.
The most spectacular and far reaching of the milit-
ary and naval uses of aircraft took place one hundred
miles at sea, off the Virginia Capes, in June, 1921.
Four of the surrendered German ships were sunk by
aircraft bombs—the U-Boat in sixteen minutes—the
Destroyer in nineteen minutes—the Cruiser in twenty-
five minutes and the dreadnought "Ostfriesland,"
christianed by the Kaiser in 1916 as the unsinkable
ship, in twenty-one and one-half minutes.
The effect of the sinking of the "Ostfriesland" was
to establish definitely in the public mind (which means
in the mind of Congress) the conviction that aircraft,
representing a total investment, including armament, of
a quarter of a million dollars, could destroy the hith-
erto unconquerable dreadnought costing $40,000,000.
It carried the conviction that the nation controlling the
air, commanded also the water beneath.
A Joint Board representing the Army and the Navy
was appointed to review the results of the tests. The
Board, on August 19, officially reported:
"The aviation and ordnance experiments con-
ducted with the ex-German vessels as targets have
proved that it has become imperative as a matter
of national defense to provide for the maximum
possible development of aviation in both the Army
and Navy. They have proved also the necessity for
aircraft carriers of the maximum size and speed to
supply our fleet with the offensive and defensive
power which aircraft provide, within their radius
of action, as an effective adjunct of the fleet. It i=
likewise essential that effective anti-aircraft arm-
ament be developed."
These tests gave to the world a new conception of
aircraft as mammoth artillery—flying cannon of great-
er caliber than anything hitherto dreamed of, possess-
ing infinite mobility, and with a range and degree of ac-
curacy that upset all past standards. Nothing but a Dis-
armament Conference and a ten year naval holiday
could give the great powers relief from their tremend-

ous expenditures for types of ships made obsolete by
these tests, and a breathing spell in which to recover
from the shock of this astounding revelation and to re-
adjust their opinions and policies for future national
defense.
Commercial Aviation Developing Slowly
Military and Naval aviation, to be of the maximum
aid to our country in an emergency, must have a sub-
stantial background of commercial aviation in peace
times. Commercial aviation in America can not, how-
ever, receive any great impetus until Congress has laid

Fig. 3.—A Flying Boat Above the Capital
(Official Photograph—U. S. Navy)
a proper legislative foundation. There must be created
a i'ureau of Aeronautics in the Department of Com-
merce to inspect, license and regulate airdromes, air-
planes and pilots before the safety of the service will
justify any considerable investment of captial or re-
ceive substantial public patronage. The initial stages
of this commercial development would be greatly quick-
ened if there could also be provided financial encour-
agement by the Government to operating companies
during the period when the new venture was using
obsolete war material to carry on with while developing
new types suitable for commercial use.
Aviation will probably develop first and fastest
along the same lines as our railroads. That is—com-
panies will be formed to transport passengers and
freight between remote points. That air travel can be
made safe and dependable on these long routes is borne
out by the following statement of Colonel Henderson,
Assistant Postmaster General.
''The Air Mail Service is limited by law to one
Transcontinential route from New York to San
Francisco. This route is 2,680 miles in length, mak-
ing a round trip of 5,360 miles. This round trip is
covered each day, except Sundays and holidays, of
the year. This necessitates an annual schedule fly-
ing on the part of our force of approximately I,-
800,000 miles.
"From July 6, 1921, until September 7, 1922,
we flew approximately 2,000,000 miles without a
fatal accident. During the fiscal year ending June
30, 1922, we maintained an efficiency of 94.39 per
cent. This means that out of every 100 trips sched-
uled, 94.39 were finished on schedule time. Our
records show that two-thirds of our trips were made
in clear weather; one-third were made in foggy,
cloudy or stormy weather.
"On September 16th, we finished 10 consecutive
weeks of flying the entire Transcontinental route
with 100 per cent efficiency; that is to say, during
these weeks each of our scheduled trips was started
and finished exactly on schedule time. It should
be remembered that our daily route includes the
crossing of three mountain ranges—the Alleghenv
mountains, the Rockies and the Sierras.
"It is obvious that in order to get from the air-
plane all that it may offer in the shape of postal
service, it will be necessary to fly at night. With
this thought in mind, we have for the past four
months conducted an intensive series of experi-
ments on this subject. Our experiments and study
have reached the stage where it is, I think, safe to
conclude that is is entirely possible to fly at night.
We expect within a few weeks to light, as an xper-
iment, our Chicago field, and I am personally op-
timistic enough to predict that within six er eight
months we will be able to fly from Chicago to Chey-
enne at night.
"If we are successful in this, it will mean that
we will be able to make a transcontinental flight
from New York to San Francisco in one continu-
ous movement—flying from New York to Chicago
in the daytime, Chicago to Cheyenne at night, and
from Cheyenne to Frisco during the early part of
the second day. We should be able to establish and
maintain a schedule of from twenty-eight to thirty
hours between New York and San Francisco, if
this night flying experiment proves out."
The records that are being established by the Post
Office on the Coast to Coast route can be duplicated
over a system of airways to connect all our large
centers of population. Such a service would shrink
the United States to one-third of its present size, as
measured by former standards of transportation. For
instance: New Orleans would be come ten hours
from Detroit instead of thirty-three hours; Omaha,
seven instead of twenty-one; Montreal, five instead of
sixteen; and Jacksonville, ten instead of thirty-eight.
These new measures of distance have been taken
from the speeds made regularly in the New York to
San Francisco Mail rianes.
These are a few of the possibilities over land. Let
us consider the water.
Look at a map and think of what is offered by our

eleven thousand miles of coastline, including the Great
Lakes, and our enormous inland river development.
All our large cities, from Portland to Galveston, from
Seattle to San Diego and from Buffalo to New Orleans,
are located upon it. And in nearly every case a flying
boat can land almost at the very heart of the business
district without a cent of expenditure for real estate.
Seaplane landing fields are literally unlimited, both in
number and extent. The business man, or the tour-
ist, or the case of goods, can be landed right at the
foot of "main street;" and what is highly important,
the fact of the line's existence is thereby constantly
held before the eye of the public. The flying boat be-
comes, not a vague object, far up in the sky that one
looks at casually and forgets, but something tangible—
something that one sees departing and arriving at
stated times, and that is worth going down to see, as
much as "train time" draws forth a crowd at any small
town railway depot.
This last aspect is very essential. It is conceded
that the American public must be "sold" on the idea
of commercial air transportation. And it is an axiom
that in order to "sell" any product to the public, that
product must be brought to their attention constantly

in depth determination of about eighty fathoms (480
feet). Dr. Hayes has made use of the principle of the
well-known Michelson interferometer by sending out
successive signals at regular short intervals, which in-
tervals can be controlled by a key for a rather wide
range. The operator's 2-receiver head-set is so con-
nected that one phone is made to register the signals
sent out, and the other the echoes from the sea-bottom.
The signal interval, which is designated p, can be so
adjusted that the signals and echoes are synchronized
binaurally. This happens when the echo of the first
signal is synchronized with the second signal, with the
third signal, and so forth in succession. In any case
the equation holds that t=n p, where t is the time of
the double journey of the sound to the bottom, p the
signal interval, and n a whole number. Since, how-
ever, 2 D=Vt, D=^2 V n p, where D is the depth of
Water and V is the velocity of sound in water (4800
feet). In order to determine n and p, a modification of
a gramophone disc is driven at constant speed with a
small wheel carried upon its friction surface and cap-
able of being moved backward and forward along a
radial scale. The measured radial distance of this
small wheel from the center of the disc being under
control of the operator, cam wheels carrying one or
more projections are adjusted so as to b2 engaged by
the friction wheel traveling on the disc, and the cam
projections as they are engaged, open and close the
and by actual demonstrations. To the average man in
the street, an airplane is yet a frail, insecure thing.
However, mistaken though that impression may be,
he has it. Aviation fields are usually distant from town
and not much frequented, except by enthusiasts. The
seaplane, on the other hand, reminds one of a boat.
Its very lines, the luxurious equipment and roominess
of the cabin inspires a feeling of safety and comfort.
Moreover, it can be inspected at any time, for it lies
moored down the street at the waterfront. Between
July 17th and September 17th, 1922, flying boats car-
ried 1,839 passengers between Detroit and Cleveland.
During the recent National Air Races at Detr?:t
a ground speed of 248 miles per hour was made. If
we cut this in half, as a fair measure for average rapid
transit by air, then man's radius of action in one hour
has been increased from four to six miles by horse,
twenty-five to thirty miles by automobile, and thirty-five
to forty-five miles by train, to one hundred to one
hundred twenty miles by plane. Expressed in another
way—man's one hour unit of transportation has been
doubled by the horse, increased ten times by the motor
car, fifteen times by the train and forty times by the

The above equation for determining the depth becomes
transformed into the following

where P is the constant period of rotation of the disc

ings for two consecutive adjustments of the friction
wheel for coincidence between signals and echoes. Us-

outline of the bottom was minuately recorded and
shown to consist of mountains and table lands, some
of which rose about 4,000 feet above the general level.
The destroyers Hull and Corry are now about to run
7,000 miles of continuous soundings between San
Francisco and Point Descanso, Mexico. Especial at-
tention is being given to a small area of very rugged

to have been subject to changes of level at the time of
earthquakes.


Water Will Make Fertile Great Tracts of Arid Land and Furnish a Cheap Source of Power
By R. C. Starr, '07E
THE FUTURE growth of California is largely
dependent upon the economic use of her great-
est natural resource, the use of her water in irrigation
and power development.
Looking back over the history of California, we
find the first major step in her growth was due to
the mining industry. As this great industry developed,
centers of population grew
up which required that
careful attention be given
to raising of farm products
and consequently we find
that California's second
step ahead was due to her
agricultural growth. The
third step, in which we are
now particularly interested,
is dependant upon the com-
bined growth of the agri-
cultural and manufacturing
industries, which in turn
depend chiefly upon the ec-
onomic use of our storage
waters, primarily for ir-
rigation purposes and sec-
ondly for power develop-
ment. When it is realized that California has an
agricultural area much greater than that of the entire
islands of Japan, where 55,000,000 people live primar-
ily by agricultural pursuits, one can easily believe that
the statements of some of our most prominent citizens
that California.will some day support 30,000,000 peo-
ple, is not a dream. The great valleys of the San
Joaquin and the Sacramento, backed by the snow-fed
streams from the Sierra Nevada, make the future
agricultural development of California an economic
certainty.
The economic use of the waters of these streams
can only be made possible by the storing of the flood
runoffs in mountain reservoirs which will regulate the
flow of the streams and make it possible to carry
water to the valley irrigation districts at the time
when irrigation is needed. The average annual run-
off of our California streams is something over 30,-
000,000 acre feet and there are easily 20,000,000 acres
of land susceptible to intensive cultivation. Our great-
est irrigation engineers have stated that there is ample
water from the Sierra Nevada streams to irrigate suc-
cessfully all of the irrigable lands of the State. Those
familiar with the growth of the valley sections of
California realize that the placing of 20,000,000 acres
of land under cultivation means increased population
and investment. Statistics show that in irrigated
areas, for every individual living on a farm there are
two more individuals living in towns nearby, and it
is further shown that the average expenditure by the
average farmer on a piece
of land means an average
annual investment of over
$10,000. It is evident,
therefore, that primarily
the future growth of Cali-
fornia is dependent upon
bringing in new agricultural
settlers and the most im-
portant factor necessary to
accomplish this will be the
economic development of
our streams for irrigation
purposes.
EDITOR'S NOTE:—Mr. R. C. Starr, of the firm
of Thcbo, Starr &amp; Anderson of San Francisco, is the
chief engineer of the Merced Irrigation Project whicli
provides irrigation for 180,000 acres of land in the State
of California. This development includes the construc-
tion of the highest arch dam in the world, which will
rise 310 feet above the river bed, and will be 830 feet'
long on the crest and 136 feet thick at the base.
Mr. Walter Graham, of the Highway Magazine,
describes the new method used in working out the de-
sign for this dam as being a mixture of a few pounds
of plaster of paris and a still smaller quantity of highly
concentrated gray matter. This method consisted of
building exact plaster models of the dams which might
have been used at several locations in the river canyon
and choosing the one having the least volume. This re-
sulted in the saving of 30,000 cubic yards of concrete.
The accompanying illustration shows the model of the
Merced Irrigation District Dam, with penstocks and
powerhouse and a model of the old Call Building in San
Francisco to show the relative size.
Use of Power Diminishes
Irrigation Cost
It is well understood by
those familiar with the sources of water supply in Cal-
ifornia that it is not only possible to store our tor-
rential streams for irrigation purposes, but it is also
possible in most cases to develop power from the same
sources. This makes the cost of water for irrigation
very much less than it would be if this fortunate
condition did not prevail. It is, therefore, essential
that both agricultural and power development, where
possible, go hand in hand. The use of our storage
water must be regulated for irrigation purposes pri-
marily. However, it so happens in California that the
maximum power demands are somewhat parallel to
the water requirements for irrigation and for this
reason the power output from the storage reservoirs
will in the future help to maintain the cheap cost of
power in California.
Western initiative and aggressiveness in power de-
velopment, together with a basic understanding of this
highly specialized branch of engineering, has led to
employing the most economic methods possible in the
design and construction of our western projects, and
due to minimum costs and the greater abundance of
available water power has resulted in a per capita

development that is much greater than that of the
Eastern States. Owing to the vast number of water
power sites capable of economical development, the
future growth per unit of population will be far in
excess of any other section of our nation.
At the present time, comparing the cost of power in
California with power in other parts of the United
States, we find that the average cost of power in Cali-
fornia per K.W.H. generated is 1.42 cents, compared
with 2.17 cents in the United States as a whole.
Industries of practically every kind are first attracted
by cheap power, this being one of the fundamental
requisites of any manufacturing enterprise, and with
shown by the fact that over 50 per cent of total stock
and almost 50 per cent of total bonds of our hydro-
electric companies are held by the people of Cali-
fornia.
Manufacturing is Rapidly Increasing
Statistics show an interesting comparison of the
growth of basic industries using electric energy in
California, as measured by the value of manufacturing,
agricultural and mining products. From 1880 to 1900
a more or less constant ratio prevailed, but in the next
tcn years we note that manufactured products have
taken a decidedly upward trend in value and in 1920

an abundance of power to be developed, if it be de-
veloped economically, it should not be difficult for a
layman and much less for an economist to understand
why California is destined to become the greatest
state in the Union. In addition to an abundance of
cheap power, California is fortunately possessed
with practically an unlimited supply of raw materials
to which easy access may be had and combining with
this situation the item of a plentiful and efficient labor
market, we have the three principal factors which de-
termine the cost of manufactured articles. The ques-
tion of freight rates at the present time and future
problems to be encountered in their adjustment has
made it necessary that many eastern manufactures
take into serious consideration the extremely favor-
able condition which California has to offer for the
establishment of permanent industries. Western cap-
ital is gradually seeing the benefits to be derived from
the investments in western enterprises and although
we have depended to a large extent upon eastern cap-
ital in the past, this is not so much the case now, as is
out of a total value of $2,649,000,000 for these three
basic industries, we find that the value of manufactures
alone amounted to $1,900,000,000. In other words,
over 70 per cent of the total value of our three prin-
cipal industries is attributed directly to manufactur-
ing enterprises. This clearly shows that California is
fast becoming a manufacturing State and due in a
large measure to the cheap power available, and if the
future can be judged by the past and present, it would
indicate that California's greatest growth will be in
manufacturing and if any one cause can be assigned
to permit this growth to continue, it could be none
other than the further development of our power re-
sources.
Through the benefits which are being derived from
our unequalled hydro-electric resources, California
has been able to show the fastest rate of growth, dur-
ing the last decade. The possibilities for individual
achievements can not be found elsewhere in Amer-
ica, and California is proving a very great attraction

has emerged as the principal raw material for our
present newsprint, wrapping and a large part of our
bond and writing papers. It may be interesting to
consider briefly the manufacture of paper from
wood with some of the problems which it presents.
The manufacturing principles involved in the manu-
facture of paper are very simple. The carrying out of
the ideas however, in an efficient and economical way is
iiuich more difficult. Briefly the principle involved
consists simply in taking a thin slurry of wood or other
libers in water. These libers should not be longer than
a few milemeters. By filtering this slurry of fibers on
a screen of some sort a mat of felted fibers will be ob-
tained. This when pressed and dried would give a
paper similar in character to blotting paper. In order
to impart strength to the paper and to give it the char-
acteristics necessary for writing or printing upon, it is
necessary to incorporate some binding or sizing mater-
ial and some fdler in order to lower its porosity.
With this brief discussion as to what paper is, we
shall divide our discussion of paper manufacture into
two parts:
1. The production of the fibers themselves from
which the paper is manufactured. This part
of the process is known as pulp manufacture.
2. The manufacture of paper from pulp.
There are several ways in which we may obtain the
fibers from the wood in the manufacture of pulp. They
may be classified as mechanical or ground wood pulp,
and Pulp obtained by one of several chemical pro-
cesses, namely, sulphite pulp, soda pulp, and kraft pulp.
The simplest form of pulp is ground wood,
made almost exclusively from spruce. The wood
must be sawed into suitable lengths and carefully
barked as any bark or dirt will make black specks
in the pulp which will go through into the paper.
The most common form of barker is the drum,
which consists of a cylindrical steel cage about 10
feet in diameter and 40 feet long, on the inside of
which are set angle irons on edge running length-
wise of the drum. As these are revolved the wood
tumbles around hitting the sharp edges of the iron
and knocking off the bark. The chief objection to
the drum is that it "brooms up" the ends of the
wood badly and these ends make slivers in the pulp
but the total loss of wood in a drum barker is less
than by any other means.
Grinding Process is of Great Importance
The stone on which the wood is ground is of
coarse texture and is usually about 5 feet in dia-
meter and 2 feet thick. The wood is held against
this by hydraulic pressure,, the length of the wood
being equal to the thickness of the stone. A stream of
water keeps down excessive heat and washes down
the ground wood pulp which comes out in a con-
tinuous stream. Most grinders have three or four
pockets in which the wood is placed and the quan-
tity and quality of wood ground is dependent on
the pressure exerted against the stone, the tempera-
ture of grinding, the speed of the stone, and its
sharpness. The stones are sharpened by running a
hardened steel burr across them which imprints a
pattern suitable to the grade of pulp it is desired to
make. The average speed of the stone is about 250
revolutions per minute. One manufacturer is mak-
ing a magazine grinder which will handle four foot
wood and which can be charged with enough wood
to last an hour but as yet there are only a few in-
stallations of this type.
Ground wood pulp contains all of the ingredients
which were present in the original wood with the
exception of a very small percentage which may be
water soluble. With good practice about 1950 lbs. of
pulp will be obtained per cord of spruce and the
yield will vary slightly if other woods are used. It
takes about 100 HP for 24 hours to grind one ton
of pulp. The pulp has very little strength and is
used as a filler in the cheaper grades of paper, news-
print containing about 8oc/o of it. It discolors badly
on being exposed to light and so cannot be used
for any paper which is intended to be permanent.
Statistics for the year 1918 show that more than
one-third of the total pulp manufactured in the United
States was ground wood pulp but it has already been
pointed out that for many kinds of paper ground wood
pulp is not suitable. For the manufacture of more
durable papers it is necessary to use fibers which have
been obtained from the wood by one of the chemical
processes previously mentioned. The chemical pro-
cesses are based upon the fact that wood primarily is a
compound cellulose, the so called ligno-cellulose. By

subjecting the wood to one of the several chemical pro-
cesses previously mentioned the lignin binding material
*s~\ in the wood is split away from
I\J the cellulose leaving the fi-
*~cv»odn kers m tne1r natural length as
t * j^_x they occurred originally in the
wood whereas the mechanical
process splits these fibers into
smaller lengths than they were
originally.
Sulphite pulp is made by
cooking wood chips under
pressure with a solution of
calcium bisulphite and sul-
phuric acid. The woods used
are spruce, hemlock, balsam
and sometimes a few others.
The cooking acid dissolves out
the lignin binding material in
the wood and leaves the cellu-
lose fibres very little attacked.
There are two types of acid
making systems in general use.
5 The older type is the milk of
5 lime in which the sulphur di-
oxide gas from a sulphur
j burner is run through a milk
of lime solution. There are
} several forms of this type,
some using tanks for the lime
( water and others using a
tower with the lime water
trickling down and the gas as-
cending against it. The oth-
5 er type uses a tower filled with
lime stone with a stream of
water running down and the
sulphur dioxide gas ascending.
There are many complications
arising in the making of the
cooking acid which we have
not room to discuss here.
Use of Quick Cook Process
The digestors in which the
cooking is conducted are made
of boiler plate and hold from
3 to 15 tons of pulp. They are
lined with acid proof brick set
in a cement of litharge and
glycerine and with a grouting
of at least 3 inches between
the brick and the shell. All of
the fittings must be made of
acid-resisting bronze. In practice the digestors are
filled with chips and with acid made in either of the
types of systems described above. Direct steam is ad-
mitted through the bottom and the pressure is
brought up gradually to 75 lbs. The cooking process
usually takes about 8 hours and a large valve at
the bottom of the digestor is then opened and the
pulp allowed to blow out into a large pit with a per-
forated bottom where the spent acid is drained off
and fresh water turned on. This is known as the Rit-
ter-Kellner or quick cook process. Some sulphite pulp
is made by the Mitscherlick process in which the steam-
ing is indirect and the cooking time is considerably
longer, but the most of the sulphite in this country is
made by the quick cook method. After washing the
pulp is either run out into laps or is run through a
thickener and direct to the paper machines.
Sulphite pulp has considerable strength and is
largely used in a variety of papers. It is used with-
out bleaching in newsprint and wrapping papers and is
bleached for finer grades. The yield from hemlock is
about 950 lbs, per cord of rossed wood and a trifle
more from spruce.
Some kinds of wood are cooked with a solution
of caustic soda by the so-called soda process. The di-
gestors are similar to those used for sulphite except
that they have no lining and generally have a false bot-
tom about 4 feet up, and piping so arranged that the
cooking liquor can be circulated by an outside pump
during the cooking process. Indirect steam is also
used in the soda process. All of the fittings can be of
iron. The soda is recovered by evaporating the waste
liquor to a solid, "black ash", and then burning this
in an incinerating furnace, the heat from the wood
products which have been extracted from the chips
of the previous cook furnishing the heat for com-
bustion of the ash and for evaporation of the incom-
ing liquor. The loss is replaced by adding soda
ash. The sodium carbonate resulting from the in-
cineration is causticized with lime and after settling
and decanting is ready to be used again.
Soda pulp is quite generally made from poplar
but almost any wood can be pulped by this process.
The pulp is generally bleached and is used as a fill-
er in book and magazine papers as it has not much
strength but makes a soft feeling sheet.
A modification of the soda process is the sulphate
or kraft process. The only difference between the
two is that the loss of soda is made up by adding salt
cake or sodium sulphate. On incineration this burns
to the sulphide which has a much milder action on
the fibres than the caustic. Kraft Pulp has unusual
strength but is very difficult to bleach and is used
mostly for strong wrapping paper where a brown-
ish color is not objectionable.
We have gone over very briefly the making of
the different kinds of pulp and the next step is to
convert it into paper. The pulp is put into a Hol-

An Article on the Present-Day Methods and Problems of This Invaluable but Obscure Profession
By Russell Watson
Assistant Professor of Forestry
IN MONTANA, the United States has reserved
about 16,000,000 acres as National Forests, this be-
ing about 18 per cent of the area of the state. This
is quite a sizable chunk, in fact about as large as the
combined areas of New Hampshire, Vermont and
Massachusetts. Congress has spent about $15,000,000
in the past ten years taking care of these Forests, and
they have done a business, in grazing fees, timber sales,
home-site privileges and other forest uses, of about
$5,000,000. The entire National Forest area of the
West is about 155,000,000 acres. However, in order
that the children might know just what these National
Forests are, the school board of Montana formulated
the following definition:
"National Forests are large areas of mountainous
land, administered by forest rangers who lead a care-
less, carefree life in the deep, wild woods."
General Idea of Foresters' Life Incorrect
The foresters in charge, most of whom are college
graduates, lead rather a simple work-a-day life, much
of the time in an office in a small town. They note
the absurdity of the "careless, carefree life" part of
the definition, grin, and let it go at that.
Just last spring a bright eyed little old lady said to
me: "Are you a forester? If you are," the old lady
continued, "I wish that you would tell me what in the
world is the matter with my grape-vines." I might
have been funny, I suppose, and referred her to Mr.
Volstead, but instead, I did go out and look at her vines,
made a few suggestions, and I hope that they recov-
ered from their indisposition.
Not many years ago a certain western politician
who disliked the foresters because they wanted to
handle our forest resources in a sensible manner and
thus prevent them from further unbridled exploitation,
orated about as follows:
"Can you not see the deft and doughty forester, .
with a pea'-green plume stuck in his hat (thank good-
ness he didn't girdle us with a red sash like an ac-
cordian player from Bohemia), with text books of
theory in his hands, dreaming strange dreams far away
from the busy bustling throbbing world where real
men are at work producing substantial results."
The foresters themselves, in their more jocular
hours around a camp-fire, in the field, when not too
tired from the days work, or when they do not have
too many reports and maps to complete, or a telephone
connection to get through or some other prosaic per-
formance, sing to the tune of Johnnie and Frankie a
song about a forester who rescued a fair maiden from
a "great big grizz-a-ly bear," and then of course,
"You've saved muh li-ife, I'll be you're wi-ife," and
try to give the impression that saving damsels who are
in dire distress in the mountains is all part of the
days work and to be accomplished with a nonchalance
cntrancinsr to behold.

BcrxKu Fohi-st in Idaho
And for a topper, one student last year defined a
forester's work as follows: "A forester tries to be a
woodsman, and sometimes actually goes into the
woods."
I do not know if the word actually implies daring
or the essence of foolishness.
The truth of the matter is that foresters do go into
the woods. It is there that forestry is practiced, as
the banker practices banking in a bank, or a lawyer
practices in court, or the farmer on a farm. Not that
they are in the woods all of the time, in fact, they
consider themselves lucky if they can get away from
the office three or four months in the year.
Whatever misconceptions other folks may have of
the forester's work, to him it is apparent. Forestry is

the business of raising timber as a crop. It involves
starting the forest, caring for the forest, and harvest-
ing the forest.
Nation's Wood Supply Decreasing Rapidly
The forester's task in the United Stales is four-fold.
First, it is to supply this nation of 110,000,000 people
with wood that they need in their industries, farms,
homes, and in all walks of life. When it is understood
that there is more tonnage of wood used each year
than of any other material (slightly more than of coal,
and about 19 times as much as steel), and that 95 per
cent of the wood is used for the necessities of life
(housing, construction, fuel, furniture, paper, etc.),
an idea of the task before the forester is obtained.
It is his task to supply the people of the nation with
their wood necessities as it is the task of the farmer to
supply us with food, and clothing materials, and as it
is the task of the coal miners to supply the nation with
coal. But the forester's task is different from that
of the miners in this regard: Whereas the miner can-
not conserve his available supplies in any way except-
ing efficient mining, the forester can so handle his for-
est that the supplies will never be exhausted. His mine
never peters out, but continues to produce indefinitely
and at no cost excepting of sun, air and moisture, and
each of these, as the forest uses them, is an inexhausti-
ble resource. The gasoline that is burned in Ring
Eardner's "costly motor car," is lost and gone for-
ever, and all the king's horses, and all the king's men,
can't make us more oil. But the wood that is burned
can be replenished by a new growth. The 1,600,000
men who gain livelihoods by working in manufacturing
and mechanical industries which are primarily wood-
using in character (such as furniture makers, carpent-
ers, lumbermen, pulp and paper makers, etc.), may rest
assured that if the forester has his way, their jobs
will ever continue as they are at present. And it may
be said here, solemnly, that if the forester does not
have his way, these men will find themselves within a
few years out of work. Our forests are fast going.
This is the major task before the forester of the
United States.
Forests Tend to Prevent Floods
A second task before the forester is to grow for-
ests on the hillside at the headwaters of streams, in
order that the water supplies of cities may be kept
clean and that floods may be inhibited. Cold clean
water is essential to a healthy city, and plenty of it
at times of great need (as city conflagrations), is a
necessity. Dirty reservoirs, half silted up, and partially
clogged pipes, are costly and undesirable. The flood
damage at Pittsburgh averages $2,000,000 a year,
and in the Ohio Valley from Pittsburg to Cairo where
the Ohio runs into the Mississippi, it averages from
$50,000,000 to $100,000,000 a year.
Engineers should not get the notion that the forest
in some magical manner can completely check any and
all floods that happen in the vicinity. Reforestation of
a few hundred acres at the headwaters of Mad River
will not prevent a repetition of the Dayton floods.
The forest does its best as a sponge, as a mechanical
interference, and as a preventive of rapid melting
snows in the spring, but a small patch of woods at the
head of a creek tributory to a river running through
a farming country cannot prevent a torrent in the
river. The stream that flows through the woods, how-
ever, is nearly always clear and clean, and the forested
hillside does not erode.
People understand this as a matter of course, and
our first efforts in forestry, not only in the United
States but nearly everywhere in the world (and par-
ticularly now in China) came on account of this prop-
erty of the forest.
Recreational Grounds Must be Provided
A third task before the forester of the United
States, although to some scientific foresters the task-
is looked upon as sort of a necessary evil concomit-
ant with our work, is to supply the major part of the

Forest Plantation at Higgin's Lake,
State Forest, Michigan
good recreation grounds for our people. As the moun-
tains in neatly alliterative fashion are said to be the
'most mighty manifestations of mere matter," and as
such have an allure to pleasure seekers that is deep,
so the forest is the greatest beautifier of Nature and
lias an appeal to everyone. The forest shelters from
storms, hides campers from the inquisitive, and is
friendly.
As a nation of urban dwellers, we need ample adn
good recreational facilities. They have a place in


Page 23

our national economy, and the increasing importance
which all large cities and states place upon this factor
of development of their social fabric is proof of it.
This part of our work has become so large that some
forest schools now offer courses called Recreational
Engineering. It is estimated that the National For-
ests have a recreational value of something like $10,-
000,000 a year. This past season approximately 5,000,-
000 people spent about 12,000,000 vacation days, free
of charge, in these forests. Taking the United States
as a whole, it is probable that the forest afforded a
beautiful recreation ground for perhaps 15,000,000
people.
Rehabilitation of Devastated Lands
A fourth task before the forester, and here he as-
sumes the role of land economist, is to make a good
economic use of poor, non-agricultural lands, and of
worn out abandoned farms. It is surprising to know
that there is in the United States an area of land,
about equal in size to Michigan, Indiana and Ohio
combined, which has been so devastated by lumbering,
forest fires, or poor farming as to leave it now a
waste, idle and unproductive. This area of about
100,000,000 acres is at present as definitely out of the
production of our essential needs of clothing, fuel,
housing and food, as if it were cut out of the nation
with a scroll saw, or flooded as a lifeless inland sea.
This man-made desert, swept by 20,000 forest fires a
year, is a menace to those who live in or adjacent to
it, it pays but little in taxes (in fact, much of it comes
up for sheriff's sale repeatedly because of non-payment
of taxes), and has many bankrupt communities within
it. Michigan alone has something like 12,000,000 acres
of this idle property, a drag upon the state, in fact as
it stands, worse than useless, a certain menace to the
prosperity of the state. All of this land at one time
was well forested and a good deal of it has been farm-
ed and abandoned, all of it has been prospected time
and again by farmers and land sharks for its possible
value for farming. Yet it lies idle.
To a forester, acres of such land are like a million
soldiers to a general in time of war, who are idle be-
cause of some political friction. As the officer would
like to put these men to work without delay in the busi-
ness of routing the enemy, so the forester wants to see
trees growing on these idle acres in order to insure a
permanent and cheap supply of timber to our people
and our industries. It seems to us that the forester
alone can make best use of these poor lands. Trees
grow well on land that is lean beyond all agricultural
possibilities; stony ground and steep mountain slopes;
frosts and swamps bother them but little. The aband-
oned farm is a paradise for the pine and the spruce.
The heaviest pine forests of all the world, those in
central Michigan, grew on land so sandy and lean
that, it has been said, if we could only ship it in at
little cost, we would use the soil from worn out abond-
oned New England hill farms as a fertilizer for our
forest plantations in Michigan.
On the devastated lands the forester practices re-
forestation, i.e., planting large numbers of trees, two
or three years old and six or eight inches tall. We use
the term reforestation to indicate a reconstruction of
a forest which has been so completely destroyed that
the desirable trees, such as pines, spruces and firs, are
nearly extinct and are not capable of reseeding the
ground naturally.
The area of devastated lands in the United States
is increasing about 3,000,000 acres yearly. The job of
rehabilitating these devastated lands, and the job of
checking the senseless destruction of the forest (which
means putting a stop to making more area of such
lands), is far and away, the most urgent job that we
as foresters have to do. The task is largely political
and educational. Certainly there can be no more
noble or worth while task before any citizen of the
country he loves, than the task of properly using, re-
newing, and extending the natural resources of that
country. It is interesting to note that it was the
forester who, viewing the destruction of the forest,
first called to the attention of the people, the most
vital matter of conservation of our natural resources.
It has been men who are or were either foresters bv
trade or by instinct, as Gifford Pinchot, Theodore
Roosevelt, Dr. Fernow and John Muir who led all of
us to demand a proper usage and an equal share of
such resources as wild life, natural scenery, oil, and
water power.
Trees Should be Raised as a Crop
In order that these four major tasks may be accom-
plished, trees must be raised in the forest much as
wheat or corn is raised on a farm. The virgin,
nature-given supplies which we have drawn upon in
the past, and are drawing upon today, are in a true
sense, a reservoir which we are draining. Reliable
studies by the United States Forest Service and by
lumbermen's organizations show that we are drawing
wood from this resrvoir about four times as fast as
it is being replenished by growth. Something like 25
billion cubic feet of wood is cut from the forest yearly,
and only about 6 billion cubic feet is being added
through growth. Obviously, sooner or later, the res-
ervoir will be emptied; and the evidence shows that it
will be practically emptied in about 50 years. After
1972, we can rest assured, the United States will draw
the major part of her wood supplies from abroad, un-
less most herculean steps are taken immediately to
remedy the situation. To relieve this approaching
timber famine and the resultant high prices, we must
handle wisely our remaining forests and also reforest
and take care of our devastated lands.
Subsidies can't make trees grow faster than their

wont. As a nation, our supplies of timber will be
exhausted in 50 years. It takes a hundred years to
grow a tree. It is time we got busy.
Contrary to general opinion, the forester takes as
one of the fundamentals of his business, that he shall
obtain a yearly crop from his forest. It may take a
hundred years to grow a tree, but if you have a hun-
dred trees, you can cut one each year for a hundred
years. If you plant a tree each time that you cut one
down, then evidently, at the end of a hundred years
you have cut a hundred trees and have planted a
hundred trees—and you have exactly as many trees
at the end as when you started. The operation may
be kept up indefinitely, for the forest under this treat-
ment never wears out. This process is what we call
a sustained annual yield and is at the bottom of all
forest working plans. By means of such a system,
only the amount that grows each year is cut each
year.
Apply the same plan to 100,000 acres—which is a
fair sized forest property.' If it takes 100 years for the
trees to become sizeable and be ready for the axe, then
each year we cut i/ioo of 100,000, or 1,000 acres.
Proper measures are taken to reforest the cut-over
land, and after cutting for 100 years the forest will
be entirely cut over and yet will support as heavy a
growth as it did in the beginning. We reset each piece
after cutting and let it grow.
This is a common-sense method of handling a vital
resource, for the forest is -not destroyed. It is right
here that forester differs from the lumberman. In-
stead of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, the
forester keeps her in good health, protects her and
cares for her. Instead of mining the forest, working
it out and abandoning it, he takes it easier, perpetu-
ates the forest and gives timber to the nation.
The ways and means that are used in startiiig and
caring for the forest, and harvesting the crop from
it, make up the bulk of the forester's studies. He must
be a scientist of parts, for it is he of all botanists and
zoologists who must not alone know theory but who
must also put the acid test to the theories—he tries
'em out in the woods. The validity of his judgment
in their use, the expertness of his skill in applying
them may make or break his enterprise. He is, further-
more, a business man in charge of a property com-
monly worth from $1,000,000 to $10,000,000. A good
administrative ability together with a certain tact which
enables him to handle and meet men, are necessary
qualifications for the successful pursuit of his work.
The forest that is a success as a business, as any
other big business, is the result of well thought out
working plans, faithfully followed through the years.
The utmost discernment in science, economics and busi-
ness, are frequently needed. The attacks of insects,
fungi and fire must be overcome; future values of
land and timber must be anticipated as far as possi-
ble; development projects, highways, towns and rail-
roads, are layed out. We dip into the future as far
as we can see in attempts to envisage the future as far
peoples, trades and politics, for we are building for the
future as well as the present. Our imaginative, far
reaching plans, are entrancing to that young man who
sees visions and dreams dreams; our practical every-
day life makes us build our dreams on sound mate-
rial, and he with common sense and good judgment
wins.
But basically our job is simple: We are raising the
timber for the nation.

lo conservative people who are planning for the future.
At the present rate of increase it is estimated that
California will have in 1950 a population of 10,000,000
people. This is a conservative possibility and as in the
case of our manufacturing, so with our population—
hydro-electric energy will be the greatest power to
bring about this accomplishment.
8,250,000 Available H. P. Undeveloped
It is estimated that the total available horse power
from hydro-electric sources in California amounts to
about 10,000,000; of this amount approximately
1,750,000 has been developed. Those who make a
study of the many problems which affect our develop-
ment realize that it is absolutely impossible to take ad-
vantage of the wonderful possibilities, particularly in
manufacturing, which the future offers, without first
making certain that we are always to have available
an ample supply of cheap power. It is with this par-
ticular object in view that we are constatntly making
studies and investigations of various sources of water
and power supply in order that we may be prepared
to solve this basic problem which so vitally affects the
interest, in one form or another, of every individual in
California. It should be constantly borne in mind that
such a development can not proceed economically if
private enterprise is hampered or handicapped in any
way, due to politics or party control.
We point with pride to California's accomplish-
ments in hydro-electric development. Our enviable
record as a State, pioneering in this line of
endeavor, has attracted attention from all parts
of the world. This has been made possible on
a large measure through the initiative and individual
effort of our public utility companies operating under
proper regulation. This policy, which has been so suc-
cessful in the past, if continued in the future, will in
itself be a guarantee that California will always rank
first in the production of cheap power, which mean?
that her future position as a manufacturing state will
be second to none in the Union.

The Illinois and Michigan Canal has 15 locks 16 feet wide by
ino feet long, with a capacity of 140 tons per lock, about equal tn
the average train load in 1880. It competed successfully with the
railroads no to 1882.

TN 1908 the people of
-*- the State of Illinois
voted to bond themselves
to the amount of $20,-
000,000.00 to construct
the Illinois Waterway,
which is officially known
as the improvement of
the Des Plaines and Il-
linois Rivers between
Lockport and Starved
Rock near Utica, Illinios,
to provide navigable wat-
ers and water power.
Three plans of im-
provement were propos-
ed and considered. The
first plan contemplated
the construction of a ship
channel from Chicago to
the Gulf of dimensions
adequate for ocean go-
ing vessels. This plan
would be excessive in
cost, and out of propor-
tion to the prospective
benefit to be received.
The second plan contemplated the construction of
moderate depth channels, with small sized locks, 55X
?50 feet. This limited the barges to too small sizes
for economical haul. Neither plan met with the ap-
proval of the Federal Government.
In 1917, the writer was employed to review the sit-
uation, report on the various plans submitted, and
recommend a plan that would fulfill the wishes of the
people and meet the approval of the War Department.
After reviewing all the data available, it was recom-
mended that both plans heretofore considered should
be rejected and a third one hereinafter described ad-
opted. The following were the physical and commercial
conditions found:
The rivers of the Mississippi Valley are in their
natural state broad, shallow, relatively of low velocity,
and, excepting the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers,
do not carry a large amount of silt in suspension. The
Illinois River traverses an alluvial valley having low
banks and a much more stable regimen than is found
on the Mississippi River. The slope in the stream from
Utica to the mouth is very flat, averaging only .13
feet per mile. In most instances the curves are of

EQUAL TO 300 CARLOADS
The Illinois Waterway will have 5 locks no feet wide by 600
feel lung, whose capacity will be 9,000 tons per lock, which is equal
to 13 average trains loads of 1920. The- cost of haul by water is
about one-third the railroad freight rate of IQ2I.
long radius and the
stream is, in its natural
condition, well adapted
to carry an enormous
commerce. A hasty sur-
vey of the commerce
available revealed that
there was large tonnage
of raw products such as
coal, sand, gravel, grain
and lumber immediately
adjacent to the river
banks awaiting a cheap
means of transportation
to a proper consumptive
demand. This freight
was supplemented by
large tonnage of manu-
factured articles that
would seek transporta-
tion between Chicago
and St. Louis and points
southward to the sea.
Computed on the basis
of the average tonnage
per capita in the United
States, the commerce of
Chicago alone amounted to upwards of 60,000,000
tons annually. Actually its tonnage exceeds this
amount. Much of this freight is north and south
bound in domestic and foreign commerce. The man-
ufacturers of Chicago alone exceed one-third of the
foreign commerce of the United States.
Experience in transportation on highways, rail-
ways and waterways has shown that the cost of trans-
portation varies inversely to the load transported.
The construction of waterways the world over has
shown that they have been built too small or at least
the business attracted to waterways has outgrown
their accommodations. Federal engineers have real-
ised this in planning for the improvement of the Ohio
River in which stream they have designed locks 11o
feet wide and 600 feet usable length.
With the conditions above enumerated there seem-
ed to be but one answer to the problem. To be de-
signed along economic lines, the waterway should be
broad and of medium draft to meet the natural condi-
tions of the streams to be utilized and the locks should

be so designed as to accommodate fleets of large ton-
nage. To meet these conditions, it was recommended
that the channel should have a bottom width of at
least 200 feet and the locks should have horizontal
dimensions of 110 feet by 600 feet and capable of pas-
sage of cargoes of from 7000 to 9000 tons in one lock-
age. The channel depth should be at least 8 feet and
the locks so designed that in the future when business
has increased and money is available the channel could
be deepened to 14 feet
Various Lock Sites Determined
About this time, Congress was trying to pass a
Federal Water Power Act, looking to intelligent de-
velopment and utilization of the water power on the
navigable streams of the United States. The bill
finally became law and required that in the improve-
ment of navigable streams consideration should be
given to full utilization of the stream lor both power
and navigation purposes so as to best conserve the
natural resources of the streams of the United States.
In early studies for the development of navigation on
the Illinois River by the Federal engineers, little at-
tention was given to power possibilities. This was
excusable from the fact that at that time water power
was of little value and the transmission of electric
power over long distances was unknown. With the
demand for power increased and the art of transmis-
sion perfected as it is today, radical changes in design
for the waterway were necessary. The Sanitary Dis-
trict of Chicago has completed a sanitary and ship
canal from Chicago southwestward to Lockport, about
35 miles distant, at which point it has constructed a
small lock and a power plant. This is the site for the
first lock in the improvement of the Desplaines and
Illinois Rivers. At this site a lock will be constructed
of the dimensions heretofore outlined and will have
a lift of 41 feet connecting the Sanitary District chan-
nel with the Des Plaines River. Joliet lies a short
distance below this point and its existence presents
quite complicated engineering study for a waterway
through the city. Several plans have been considered,
among them one utilizing the present stream with
either one or two locks and another plan utilizing the
old I. &amp; M. Canal widened and having either one lock
or two locks. Studies were made of all these plans
and it was found that, considering the cost and utility,
the best plan would be to carry the water through
the city at the lower Lockport level and construct a
lock at the southerly limits of the city, which would
be known as the Brandon Road lock, having a lift at
low water of about 32 feet. The construction of this
lock will require high gravity concrete retaining walls
on either bank of the river to protect the city from the
new elevation of water in the Des plaines River. The
construction of this lock would also flood the mouths
of all the sewers emptying into the Des Plaines River,
necessitating intercepting sewers along both banks.
These sewers are to be contained in the gravity re-
taining walls and in addition to serving their purpose
as intercepting sewers will act as cut-off channels for
any seepage from the river, thus preventing damage
to basements.
Two miles below the junction a suitable location
for the next lock was found at a point where the rock
begins to disappear below what will be the improved
channel of the Illinois River. This site was developed
by core drill borings and after comparative estimates
were made the site was adopted for the following
reasons:
1. The cost for the complete waterway would be
much less than by the adpotion of a site above the
mouth of the Kankakee River,
2. It would result in a much better navigable
channel.
3. It would extend navigation five miles up the
Kankakee River, which stream may later be improved
for navigation purposes.
4. It best met the Federal Government's require-
ments as outlined in the Water Power Act.
This lock will be known as the Dresden Island lock.
From this point down stream, the Illinois River
can be utilized for several miles in its natural condition.
At Marseilles private interests constructed a dam
across the river pursuant to a legislative act dated
1865. This dam backs the water upstream several
miles. Water power was created by this dam and
several water power and manufacturing interests have
grown up at that point, a consideration of which com-
plicated waterway designs. Had these interests not
been developed, the natural place for the forth lock
and dam in the series would have been about 13,000
feet further down stream where a dam should have
been constructed with a crest about 5 feet above the
crest of the present dam, which would have backed
the water up nearly to the site of the Dresden Island
lock. In order not to disturb vested interests, it was
deemed advisable to either raise the crest of the pres-
ent dam or construct another one a few hundred feet
upstream from it with a crest about 5 feet above the
crest of the old dam, and to construct a diversion can-
al 13,000 feet long with a lock at its lower end having
a lift of 21 feet and connecting with the river near
the upper end of Bell's Island.
Flood-Areas Cause Much Trouble
Between this point and Utica, the river contains
several large tillable islands and in many places banks
are low and are annually inundated, though usually
much of the land is available for crops and pasture.
To add to the difficulties some of the parks, school
grounds, and sewer outlets at Ottawa are low and are
annually inundated and would be permanently flooded
by any great raise in the elevation of the water from

dams downstream. Engineers have suggested various
plans for the improvement of this reach of the stream.
Before the enactment of the water power law, Fed-
eral engineers suggested two dams of about 8 foot
lift each, one located above Ottawa and the other one
at or near Utica. These dams would not flood much
of the uplands and would not seriously interfere with
the improvements at Ottawa. Another plan has been
to construct a 16 foot lift lock and dam at Utica,
which would flood all of the islands. The low lands
on either bank of the stream were to be protected by
long dikes or trailing walls built above flood heights.
Present estimates show the cost of these walls exceeds
the value of the lands to be protected; also the pres-
ence of these walls would introduce drainage problems
difficult of solution. Taking all these matters into con-
sideration, it has been thought wise to construct one
lock and dam at the lower end of the reach; that is
near Utica and flood all the islands and low lands.
flans as outlined for various locks meet the re-
quiremnts of the Federal Water Power Act and
create large deep water pools well adapted for slack
water navigation. Throughout the entire reach of the
Des Plaines and Illinois Rivers to be improved the
banks are low and adjacent lands are available for
agricultural purposes. If dams were to be built with
fixed crests, large tracts of land would be flooded
during high water periods that heretofore have been
above the flood plain. In order to preserve these
lands dams have all been provided with movable
crests so designed that they can be raised during flood
periods and the high waters resulting will not mate-
rially exceed those prevailing before the improvements.
The Illinois River is formed by the confluence of
the Des Plaines and Kankakee Rivers. The former
has a low water flow of less than 100 second feet and
a maximum discharge of over 13,000 second feet.
The Kankakee River has a mean low discharge of
from 200 to 400 second feet and a maximum of possi-
bly 40,000 second feet. At Ottawa the Fox River
empties into the Illinois and below their junction the
maximum discharge may exceed 80,000 second feet.
The water for the summit level of this waterway is
obtained from I^ake Michigan through the Chicago
Sanitary District Canal. The mean flow in the San-
itary District Canal now probably exceeds 8,000 sec-
ond feet, and this, together with the natural flow in
the streams amply supplies all the water necessary for
navigation purposes and leaves a good surplus for
power development. If the Diversion from Lake
Michigan were limited to the amount necessary for
navigation purposes only, the cost of constructing
the Illinois Waterway would be increased at least two
million dollars.
Bad flood conditions prevail along the Des Plaines
and Illinois Rivers during the winter season. In ex-
treme cold weather ice forms on these streams and
is met by warmer water from Lake Michigan and
Chicago sewage which carries great quantities of
floating ice down the stream. This ice finds lodgment
on the shallow places, islands and projecting points
on the shore lines, causing ice gorges that frequently
do much damage to adjacent property. It is hoped that
the construction of the locks and the resultant deep-
ening of the channel will lessen the danger from these
ice gorges, if in fact, they are not entirely eliminated.
All the structures to be built along this waterway
are founded on rock and the lock walls will be of the
gravity type of concrete built in accordance with usual
specifications for such work. So far as the writer
knows, miter walls have always been designed to re-
ceive considerable pressure from the lock gate. While
the miter walls for this waterway are strong enough
to receive such pressure, the gates have been designed
so that no pressure of consequence can be transmitted
from them to the miter walls. A metal spring has
been introduced between the gate and the miter sill
which spring receives only the pressure from the wat-
er directly against it and forms the seal between the
gate and the sill, the gate thus bearing at its miter
and heel posts only. The lock gates are of the miter-
ing type and do not differ materially from the design
in use on other waterways.
New Improvements on Filling Systems
The filling and emptying system is made up of two
12 foot longitudinal culverts in the lock walls with
valves at either end and communicating with the lock
chamber through a system of ports or small openings
distributed along the foot of the lock walls. Exper-
ience has shown that in shallow draft canals less dis-
turbance from the flow of water under head is creat-
ed by this system than by the system of vertical open-
ings through the floor adopted at the Panama Canal,
Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Keokuk. The flow
of water through the large culvert at high velocities
creates a greater discharge at that end, the boats nec-
essarily surging on their lines and in some instances
ramming the upper gates. This phenomenon is quite
marked in high lift locks. The writer has observed in
some of the high life locks on the New York State
Barge Canal that in the first stages of filling the lock
the water is drawn into the upper ports much as water
is forced into a boiler by an injector. In order to
lessen the surging in the lock chamber, these ports
have been arranged at varying spaces at either end
of the lock, leaving a space in the center with no
ports.
Probably without exception engineers have de-
signed the valves in the filling and emptying culverts
of equal or greater cross sectional area than the cul-
vert itself. Clemmons Herschel showed many years
ago that this was unnecessary. A negligible loss of
head will result if this valve is decreased in cross sec-

tion with the culvert leading to and from it given flar-
ing sides, having an angle of about three degrees with
the sides of the culvert. The Venturi action is thus'
obtained and only a small loss of head results. To
take advantage of this condition cheapens the cost of
the culvert and permits us to use smaller and lighter
operating machinery. The valves adopted are the
vertical moving truck type similar to those used on the
New York State Barge Canal, except that improve-
ments have been made in the truck wheels. These
have been provided with helical roller bearings believed
to possess all the advantages of live rollers and to
eliminate many of the objections to such a design.
The lock gates arc operated from a spar attached at
the upper end of the gates. This spar is actuated
by a bull wheel placed in the masonry after the type
designed and patented by Edward Schildhauer for
the Panama Canal. The machinery for all the locks
will be operated electrically. Current can be obtained
from local transmission lines or will be available from
the power to be developed at the lock sites. At each
end of the locks powerful towing wenches, electrically
operated and designed to tow vessels into and out of
the locks will be installed.
Gates Operated Electrically or by Hand
As indicated above the dams are all provided with
movable crests so as to prevent excessive high waters
and great damage to adjacent property. The Taintor
gate design has been adopted for the main portions of
the dams. The only new features in this design arc
that the hammer head type of design has been adopted
instead of the usual truss or built up members at each
end of the gate. The old design introduces redundant
members whose stresses are unknown and consequent-
ly more material is used than is necessary for economi-
cal design. The other novel feature, if it can be call-
ed novel, is that the gates used at Starved Rock are
larger than any other design yet built. These gates
will have a clear opening of 60 feet and are designed
to withstand a head of 19 feet. These gates can be
counterweighted accurately so that the only force
required to raise and lower them is that due to friction
on the journals. The gates will be operated by hand
or can be operated electrically if desired. Supple-
menting these Taintor gates the dams at Brandon
Road, Dresden Island and Starved Rock will be pro-
vided with a shorter span of movable crest to be used
as an ice chute. The design will be similar to the
Taintor gate except that instead of raising out of
the water the gate will be depressed allowing the
water and ice to run over its decked surface. Its
movement will be manipulated by a system of valves
and pipes leading to the upper and lower pools.
In all canals having important summit levels it is
customary to install an emergency dam to prevent
opening up the summit level in case of accident to the
gates of the summit lock. The lock at Lockport has
been provided with an emergency gate. This gate
consists of a butterfly type of shutter normally laying
in the bottom of the canal above the upper guard gate.
Its under surface communicates with a drum sector
in the concrete which in turn communicates with the
upper and lower pools through a system of pipes and
valves. In case the lock gates are wrecked the pipes
leading to the emergency dam arc opened to the
lower pool and closed to the upper pool so that the
gate is drawn into its inclined position shutting off a
sufficient flow through the locks so that the remaining
lock gate can be closed.

A Description of the Multiple Process of Refining Copper and the Recovery of Valuable Impurities,
Continued from November, 1922
Col. H. W. Miller
Department of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing
THE BLISTER copper from the converters at the
blast furnaces is delivered to the casting-house
of the multiple system and melted in furnaces identical
with those already described. In this case, however,
each furnace is provided with its own casting wheel,
not necessarily because a single casting wheel could
not be made to serve more than one furnace, but be-
cause it may be desired to cast from more than one
furnace at the same time and it is more efficient to pro-
vide each furnace with its own casting wheel than to
attempt to make one wheel serve too many units. The
casting wheel is the same in principle and in construc-
tion as that already described. In this case, however,
the copper moulds instead of being long and narrow
are almost square and are so shaped as to cast a cake
or anode about 30 inches square by 2 inches thick with
two heavy ears extending about 6 inches from the sides
at the top. These ears are provided for the purpose
of suspending the cake in a tank, one ear resting on a
copper bar on each side of the tank. As the casting
wheel in this house revolves, the cakes are lifted out
as soon as the copper sets and immersed in water to
hasten cooling. They are then conveyed by narrow
guage cars to the multiple tank house, which is fitted
with tanks not unlike those already described for the
series casting-house. These tanks are larger, how-
ever, in that they are to receive cakes 30 inches wide
by 30 inches high. The anodes or heavy cakes are
picked up from the cars in this house by means of a
traveling crane and placed in the small tanks, one-
half charge at a time. There are copper rails on the
sides of each of the small tanks on which the ears of
the cakes rest. The cakes are placed about two inches
apart throughout the length of the tank. Since this
process is on the parallel system, copper is not dis-
solved from one cake and deposited on another unre-
fined cake as in the series system just described, but is
dissolved from each impure cake and deposited on thin
sheets of pure copper placed between. These thin
sheets of copper are produced by the electrolytic pro-
cess in separate tanks which are charged with large
cakes or anodes of the kind just described. Between
these cakes are placed smooth-surfaced rolled sheets
of copper about one-eighth of on inch thick and 30
inches square. The surface of these sheets has been
oiled to prevent the copper from sticking, and in some
cases a rubber strip is inserted around the edge to
separate the film of copper on the two sides of the
sheet.
Copper is permitted to build up on these oiled sheets
for one day, when they are removed and the film
stripped off to be used as the starting cathode in the
refining tanks. These films are of course refined cop-
per and therefore can be used as starting sheets. The
peeling off of these films of copper is a very messy and
strenuous process. It is done by loosening the film
with steel blades and stripping with wood clubs. When
the films are removed they are piled up and straighten-
ed and then have attached to them on one edge two
loops of flat copper through which a copper bar one-
half by two inches may be passed.
The above cathode films are placed between the an-
odes which, as already described, have been arranged
in the tank about two inches apart. It is not always
possible to prevent these thin cathodes from touching
the anodes, and one or two men are constantly em-
ployed in the refinery to detect short circuits and re-
move and straighten the sheets. The copper bars which
support the cathode sheets rest on a copper "lead out"
bar on the side of the tank opposite the "lead in" bar
on which anodes rest. The current then enters through
the "lead in" on one side of the tank, passes through
the anode of impure copper, thence with the dissolving
copper to the cathode sheets where the copper, is de-
posited, then into the "lead out" on the other side of
the tank and out of the refinery. In this procedure the
same impurities that were mentioned before go into
solution and the remainder drop to the bottom of the
tanks as a slime. In about 13 days the anode sheets
have been built up from a thickness of about one-
thirty-scond of an inch to about one-half of an inch
and are removed. New cathode films or "starting
sheets" are inserted and at the end of another 13 or 14
days these have been built up to full size and the or-
iginal anode is practically all dissolved. The remain-
der of the anode is then removed and sent back to
the anode casting house, and the cathodes are washed
and taken to the refinery casting house.
Refined Casting
The copper has now passed from the blister stage
through the multiple and series refineries and has ar-
rived at the refined casting house either in sheets 30
by 30 by Vi to Y\ of an inch or 12 by 20 by ji inch.

Scrap copper likewise from the rolling mills, wire mills,
and tube mills, etc., is returned to this casting house
and all is charged into furnaces practically identical in
construction with the furnaces already described for
the anode casting. These furnaces are likewise fired
with oil at similar pressures and temperatures and with
the same equipment as that already described. Ap-
proximately the same amount of oil is required for
melting down the charge, but slightly additional oil is
required for the additional work that is needed to
render the copper fit for the market. As soon as the
charge of copper—which, by the way, is 99-99 per
cent pure—has been brought fiat, iron pipes are intro-
duced through holes on the sides of the furnace op-
posite the charging doors and air at a pressure of
from 8 to 10 pounds blown in for several hours until
(he oxygen content reaches approximately .06 per
cent. It is not desired that the oxygen content remain
as high as this, but it is difficult tc stop at exactly the
right place and it is usually better to go beyond the
proper limit rather than attempt to stop too close to
the desired limit. The oxygen content is determined
through the action of a button of copper about one and
one-half inches in diameter and through the appear-
ance of the fracture of this same button. If the oxygen
content is less than approximately .04 per cent the
surface of the button will be high and the fracture
very rough. If the oxygen content is much greater
than .04 per cent the surface of the button will be low
and the fracture of a peculiar appearance. When the
content is at exactly .04 per cent the surface of the
button will be approximately flat and the fracture with-
out noticeable crystals.
Reduction of the Copper
As soon as the oxygen content has been brought to
the desired point through observance of the buttons,
the blow pipes are removed and larger holes opened
and tree trunks introduced. The previous operation
is known as "blowing" and this opeartion as "poling."
The tree trunks, three or four at a time, are pushed
into the furnace as far as possible and the outer end
pulled up by a hoist. The copper being at about 2ioocF
burns the wood rapidly and the combustion boils the
bath of copper violently. This serves two purposes:
the carbon of the wood combines with the excess
oxygen in the copper, thereby slowly reducing it to the
proper amount, and the violent boiling so mixes the
copper as to render its composition practically uniform.
Usually several hours are required for this poling
operation and as many as 12 to 15 poles at least 12
inches in diamater by 60 feet long may be consumed.
A refined casting house in full operation requires a tre-
mendous number of trees. As soon as the oxygen con-
tent has been brought to the proper point, that is ap-
proximately .04 per cent by means of this poling, the
copper is ready to be cast into shapes for the market.
Each furnace is provided with a casting wheel of a
design described and moulds are provided for casting
the copper into bars about 4 by 6 inches and of a length
varying from 30 to 96 inches for the manufacture of
wire, small ingots for the making of brass, bronze, etc.,
or for recasting into special shapes, wedge-shaped
cakes 6 by 12 by 14 inches for rolling into sheets :/$ by
12 inches for the making of phonograph master rec-
ords, cakes of any desired thickness and dimensions as
to length and width for rolling into sheets. Very large
cakes must be cast in special moulds on the floor from
a ladle because the casting wheels are not able to sup-
port some of the cakes that are wanted by the market.
Billets of any desired diameter and length for the mak-
ing of copper tubes are likewise cast on the casting
floor from a ladle.
Casting Into Ingots
The copper in this refined casting pours from the
floor of the furnace into a tilting ladle which in turn
pours the copper into the moulds one after the other.
These moulds after a quarter revolution of the wheel
pass under a large hood in which water is sprayed on
the moulds to hasten the cooling. When the wheel
has made a half revolution the moulds are turned over
and the copper drops into a bosh. They are drawn
from this bosh by an inclined conveyor and are dropped
on a long table provided likewise with a conveyor and
on which they are inspected and stamped, and then re-
moved to cars for shipment or transfer to the roll-
ing mills. It requires approximately eight hours to
cast the 250 tons of copper placed in each refined
furnace, and the volume of water pumped in and out
of the boshes is tremendous. A large cooling lake is
necessary to remove the heat that is introduced from
the copper. Future developments will probably find
some method of recovering this heat rather than hav-
ing it pass off into the air from the spray.
Necessity for Correct Oxygen Content
Here again we find a need of intensive research
work. It was mentioned before that the crystalline
coppr coming into this casting house was neither malle-
able nor ductile. When it has been melted and the
oxygen content brought to at least about .04 per cent its
conductivity, malleability and ductility are approxi-
mately as desired but nobody knows why. It is known
that if the set is high, the copper has been cast either
to hot or that there is too little oxygen in it. If the
set is low, the copper has either been cast too cold or
there is too much oxygen in it. It is not always possi-
ble to tell which is the cause of the set. Too much or
too little oxygen produces copper which will not work
satisfactorily in rolls or in the drawing dies and con-
stant troubles are experienced by rolling and wire mills
(Continued on Page 41)


Prof. Herbert C. Sadler, D.Sc.
SOME years ago, and shortly after the Experi-
mental Tank for testing models of ships was
equipped, an account of the same appeared in The
Tech nic. Since that time a great deal of interesting
work has been done, and as many generations of stu-
dents have passed, it may be of interest to give a
short account of the same.
In the first place a few words in explanation of
the methods of testing ship models, and the applica-
tion of such to actual full sized vessels, may not be
out of place. The resistance of a vessel is composed
of two parts; that due to surface friction, and that
due to wave making. Knowing the nature and extent
of the surface of a ship, and the coefficient of friction,
it is an easy matter to calculate the first of these. So
far, however, no theory has been developed which will
enable us to calculate the resistance caused by the
creation of the different waves which every ship makes
when she moves thru the water at different speeds.
If, however, a model is towed and a record of the
total resistance at any speed obtained, the surface fric-
tion can be calculated and subtracted from the total;
the remaining part is therefore the wave-making re-
sistance for the model. How then, may this be ex-
tended to the full sized ship? From hydrodynamic
theory and the Law of Similarity it may be proved
that at "corresponding speeds," that is, speeds which
vary as the square root of the ratio of dimensions of
the model and full sized ship, the wave making re-
sistances vary as the cube of the ratio of dimensions.
For exampe, suppose a vessel is to have a speed of
say 15 knots and the model is one twenty-fifth the full
size, the "corresponding speed" of the model would
be one-fifth or three knots (about 300 ft. per minute),
and at this speed the model would make exactly the
same waves, to scale, as the full sized ship at 15 knots.
The conditions of the actual ship can therefore be re-
produced in the model: and from these the actual
horsepower required for the ship, determined.
How the Models Are Made
The models used in the tank vary from ten to
twelve feet in length and are made of paraffin wax,
this material being used because of its ease of handl-
ing. The models are first cast in a clay mould, roughly
to the shape desired. They are then transferred to the
cutting machine. This machine consists of two moving
tables, upon one of which the model is placed, and upon
the other a drawing of the "lines" or longitudinal
shapes of the ship at different levels. The model
moves under two revolving cutters, actuated by a
pointer which is made to follow the lines on the draw-
ing. After the cutting operation the model is in a
series of "steps," which are removed by means of a
spokeshave and scraper until the surface is smooth and
fair. The drafts at which it is desired to run the tests
are then placed on the model, and sufficient ballast
added when afloat to bring it down to these lines. It
is then attached to the dynamometer which is mount-
ed on the traveling truck which spanks the tank. This

CirriNG Machine i'or Shaping Models
truck can be made to travel at any desired speed, and
at that speed the resistance is recorded on the drum.
The tank itself is 300 ft. long, 22 ft. wide, with a
depth of water of about 10 ft.
Research Work
Since the tank was started a number of systematic
researches have been conducted in order to determine
the effect upon the resistance of vessels of such items
as changes in fullness, form, distribution of displace-
ment longitudinally and vertically, and ratio of length
to breadth and breadth to draft. The effect of shallow
water has also been studied, and recently a number
of investigations to determine the speed of the "wake"
water at the sterns of different types were made.
The results of all these researches have been pub-
lished in the form of papers before the Society of

Naval Architects, and have added materially to the
knowledge of the resistance of vessels, and hence to
assist in obtaining the highest possible economy for
any given set of conditions.
Some special investigations other than the above
may be mentioned. A few years ago a Board of Army
Enginers was appointed to report upon the most suit-
able type of vessels for the trade on the Mississippi.
The part of the investigation which dealt with the
question of the most economical types of barges and
vessels which were finally built, were in a number of
cases tested and developed here.
The typical vessels of the Great Lakes, namely the
ore carriers, have been tested, and certain changes in
form and dimensions developed which have led to a
considerable increase in economy. The passenger ves-
sels have also received attention as well as those of

sults appeared in a Government Report and have led to
considerable changes in barge design, with the cor-
responding gain in efficiency.
Tank Valuable During the War
During the War a considerable amount of work
was done, particularly in connection with Submarines.
One set of tests may be of particular interest in that
they were made for the Submarines which were built
on this side and traveled across the Atlantic under their
own power, even before the celebrated trip of the
"Deutschland''; and afterwards did good service in
the Dardanelles and elsewhere. The effectiveness of
various shapes of submarine mines was also invest-
igated; and one particular set of tests made with a
wireless directed submarine. At that time also the
United States was starting in upon a very intensive
shipbuilding program in connection with the Merchant
Marine. Numerous new shipyards were brought into
existence, and the models for the different types of
problems to see if certain requirements of speed may
be realized, but also to carry on investigations which
will enable shipbuilders throughout the country' to know
what is the most efficient form of vessel to adopt in
order to obtain the maximum efficiency.
World's Greatest Light-house to be Built in France
A billion candlepower is to be the rating of a
new electric light-house to be built by the Techni-
cal Aeronautic Service of France on top of Mount
Afrique, near Dijon, to aid the pilots of airships
flying at night between Paris and Algiers, Mediter-
ranean ports and points in Italy, Switzerland and
elsewhere.

had a reputation for hand-
ing out a square deal. Pro-
fessor Patterson is no ex-
ception to this rule. One is
impressed on entering his
office by the atmosphere of
good fellowship. The Eng-
ineering College is behind
Dean Patterson and wishes
him the best of success in
years to come.

engineer of the Inter-State Commerce Commission.
In June 1921, he took charge of the affairs of the
Habirshaw Electric Cable Company as Federal re-
ceiver and General Manager of the Corporation, hav-
ing charge of four manufacturing plants employing
10,000 men.
Professor Worley excited much favorable press
comment by his acceptance of the Professorship, for
he leaves a consulting practice said to be worth $25,000
a year to teach at less than $5,000 a year. The Univer-
sity is indeed fortunate in obtaining Professor Wor-
ley, and his example should be an inspiration to the
members of the Engineering College.
The Building Program
Since the last issue of The Technic, considerable
progress has been made on the building program. The
new Engineering Laboratories building stands with
the frame completed, and the stone and brick facing
well under way. Work on the Educational building
has reached the same stage. The big crater which rep-
resents the present status of the new Physics build-
ing still retains its gaping aspect, altho considerable
quantities of concrete, steel and timber have been
incorporated in the foundations.
Excavations for the new Literary building have been
evident for some time. It is expected that the founda-
tions will have been completed by the end of the se-
mester. The old trees which have long been land-
marks on the campus, have given way to the spirit of
expansion and growth which has the University fast in
its grip.
Michigan's monster Field House is assuming the
proportions of a real structure. Plans called for the
completion of the edifice by Nov. 1, but due to delay in
the arrival of materials, it will not be done till late in
the year.
While not actually connected with the University,
the project of the Dormitory Corporation is of interest
to students and alumni alike. Work was started on
the first unit and others will follow soon.
Clement's Library, the splendid library of Amer-
ican History, is rapidly nearing completion and is tak-
ing on an artistic appearance.
The campus at present reminds one of the days
of construction in the devasted regions of Europe.
Short Courses in Electric Work
Co-operation of the Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment with public utilities and generating stations in
this section of the country has resulted in the announce-
ment of short courses in elementary electrical work
and meter testing which will be offered during spring
vacation. More than 60 men from power companies in
Michigan and Illinois have signified their intention of
enrolling.
Several prominent men in the electrical field are
working with the department in arranging the work;
among them are: J. C. Langdell of the Commonwealth
Edison Company of Chicago; A. S. Albright, Herbert
Sylvester and Oscar E. Hauser, of the Detroit Edi-
son Company, and H. D. Wines, secretary of the Mich-
igan Public Utilities Commission. Present plans call
for morning, afternoon and evening sessions during
the entire week. The work will consist of lectures
and laboratory work. About half of the Electrical
Engineering staff will have charge of the courses of-
fered.
Ideal Road to be Planned
Two graduate students in Highway Engineering,
brought here by the Detroit Edison Company Fellow-
ships, will work on an investigation which it is hoped
will lead to the evolving of a gravel road for Michigan
which will pack readily, afford easy maintenance and
will be practically dustless. The authorities of Wash-
tenaw County have agreed to turn over a section of
road for construction and maintenance, and will help
in any way possible.
Graduate Courses for Practising Engineers
Approximately 150 men from every state of the
Union and several foreign countries are taking the
graduate short period courses offered by the Depart-
ment of Highway Engineering and Highway Trans-
port. This is the largest number that has ever come
to Michigan and every available inch of the depart-
ment is being utilized to accommodate the increased
number of students. The course which began on De-
cember 5 will continue until March 16. As this is the
lime of the year when Highway Engineering is dull
engineers can most easily secure a leave of absence.
Michigan is the only institution in the country offering
these courses and the increased number of students is
an indication of the increasing popularity.
Advanced Courses in Radio to be Offered
An advanced course in radio known as E. E. 22
has been announced by the Electrical Department for
next semester. It will be a four hour course with
three recitations and a half day laboratory period per
week. The prerequisites are Physics 16, vacuum tubes
and E. E. 10, advanced Electrical Circuits and Elec-
tromagnetic waves on wires and in space. The number
of students will be limited while the course is being de-
veloped.
The work will consist prmarily of designing trans-


Page 35

TECHNIC

mitting and receiving sets for the laboratory and for
radio work. One advantage of the course will be that
the sets designed will be built and actually tried out.
If a student designs a motor he does not have the
opportunity of having it built and putting it into prac-
tice. It is the intention in the near future to install a
radio (telephone station for experimental purposes
and available for students in their work. Mr. E. E.
Dreese, instructor in Electrical Engineering, will have
charge of the course. Research work involving ques-
tions of design and operation has been carried on in
E. E. 9 and E. E. 18. Similar schemes are being car-
ried on at Wisconsin and Ohio State Universities.
The Chemical Engineering Society
The Chemical Engineering Society, after several
years of comparative inactivity, has again started to
meet regularly, and promises to play an important part
in the life of the members of the Department of
Chemical Engineering.
The stimulus which the Society has received comes
largely from a realization of the growth of the De-
partment of Chemical Engineering, represented in a
concrete manner by the erection of the new Chemical
Engineering building. No other proof than this struc-
ture is needed to indicate the rising importance of this
branch of the Engineering College. Provision is made
in the new building for rooms to be occupied by the
members of the Society as lounging and meeting rooms.
With a permanent home such as this, the organization
should thrive and become a powerful factor in the
Chemical Engineering Department.
In addition to the impetus furnished by the promise
of development in the department, another factor en-
hances the importance of the Society. Recently, the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers has granted
to the Chemical Engineering Society of this University
the right of establishment of its first student branch.
The organization should profit immensely from this
affiliation.
The meetings of the Society offer entertainment of
the best kind. Good speakers are always provided; at
the meeting of Dec. 13, seventy-five men listened to
Profs. W. L. Badger and A. H. White, who outlined
some characteristic Chemical Engineering problems.
Educational movies, smokers, and probably dances are
promised by the various committees. It behooves every
Chemical Engineering student to become a member of
the Society if he wishes to become better acquainted
with his chosen profession and his classmates.
L. H. Egan, President of the Union Electric Light
and Power Co. of St. Louis, has taken title to about
fifty acres of land as the site for the plant and Mc-
Clellan and Junkersfield Inc. of New York City
have been engaged as engineers and constructors.
The plant will supply the rapidly increasing
demand for electrical energy in St. Louis and
vicinity. It will be named the Cahokia Steam
Power Plant and will have an initial capacity of
60,000 k. w. and an ultimate capacity of probably
240,000 k. w.
Steam Power Plant to Cost $6,000,000
Negotiations have been completed for the con-
struction south of the city limits of East St. Louis,
Mo. of a new steam power plant to cost $6,000,000.
What Next?
The enemies of the billboard artist now have a new
foe to contend. A British pilot has invented a method
for writing on the sky with letters of smoke. The
sophisticated population of New York City was as-
tonished and was guilty of gaping for a few moments
when a British pilot on a visit wrote "Hello, U. S. A."
in the sky. A stream of smoke is produced chemically
and the airplane is put thru the gyrations of the letters
desired, leaving the word in relief against the sky.
The advertising possibilities are likely to be tremend-
ous and soon we shall see "They Satisfy" smoked out
of the tail of a speeding plane.
Bolts
"lie's a hell of an instructor, he never gives any
bolts." This is by no means an uncommon statement
around the building; and why is it that after a man
spends a hundred dollars for the privilege of going
to classes he is so anxious that a class should fail to
meet? He seems to feel that he is "putting something
over" on his instructor when in reality he is in-
creasing his own burden in that particular course.
Did you ever stop to figure that we have paid out,
cash money in advance, about twenty cents for every
class we attend? In other words we would walk into
"Hustons", lay down twenty cents, ask for a pack of
Camels, watch the money go into the cash drawer and
then hope we wouldn't get any cigarettes! Funny, isn't
it?
Be an Engineer
Why is it that a man who may be very much inter-
ested in Engineering in the class room forgets all
about it the minute he is out of the building? Engi-
neering is a practical profession. It can be easily ap-
plied to many of the things of every day life, for at
every angle there is something that should he of in-
terest to the thinking Engineer. And why can't you
be a thinking Engineer? Are you merely going to
wade around among a lot of theories and principles or
are you going to notice the achievements around you
as the direct application of these theories and princi-

pels? When you get out into the world you will not
be able to cash this "Text Book Engineering" except
as you can apply it to practical cases.
You can start being an Engineer right now. Notice
the things around you that other Engineers have done
and ask yourself if they have done the way that you
would have done them. Attack your problem, what-
ever it may he, in an engineering manner, that is: get
at the underlying principles and not stumble around
on the surface hoping to chance upon a solution. Try
and be an Engineer twenty-four hours of the day and
you will be much closer to your goal when you leave
here with your "Sheep-skin", than you would other-
wise have been.
Why Not a Gossip Room?
At present the Engineering library is being used
as a club room. Altho only a few of the students
who use the library are guilty of this, yet their number
is sufficient to warrant consideration. Almost at any
hour during the day several students are to be heard
carrying on a conversation in an undertone. To them
it may seem that they are not disturbing the others, yet
their conversation is annoying to those near them.
If the students feel they have things to discuss at
the moment why not conveniently step across the hall
to.the Engineering Society room maintained expressly
for that purpose?
Calvin W. Rice, Secretary of the A. S. M. E., re-
cently returned from a trip to South America in com-
pany with Secretary of State Hughes, declares that
the relationships of American Engineers in South Am-
erican countries with business men there are helping to
promote a feeling of amity between the commercial in-
terests of the two American continents. The Interna-
tional Engineering Congress which was held in Rio
De Janeiro, did much to cement the bonds which have
had a precarious existence since the war.
A Professor in the Engineering College has been
conducting a campaign each year to find out why
sophomores do not return to college. (Of course this
does not apply to those who have been told not to re-
turn.) After listening to the various reasons given by
students, we have come to the conclusion that the least
that could be done to get them to come bock would be
to lessen the number of problems and assignments to
one half; to double the number of hours given as credit
and to keep the number of hours required for gradua-
tion the same as it is now.
Concrete Gas Producers
The latest development of the gas industry is the
reinforced concrete gas producer. The body is shaped
in the form of a bell, and the base, which is also con-
crete, is placed in a shallow vessel of water, forming
a water seal. It has ben found to be absolutely fire-
proof—an important structural feature of gas pro-
ducers as an accidental explosion of the gas may oc-
cur at any time. Its initial cost is less than fifty per
cent of that of all steel producers used in most installa-
tions.
Highest Bridge in the United States
The highest bridge in the United States spans the
Pecos River, 50 miles west of Del Rio an the El Paso
division of the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San An-
tonio R. R. This bridge which was turned over to
the railroad company in 1892, was exceeded in height
only by two others in the world, one in Bolivia and
another in France. Since then two larger structures
have been built in Africa. The Pecos bridge is 326
feet high, 2,180 feet long and the materials used
amounted to more than 2,250 tons.
The truth of Einstein's Theory of Relatively is soon
to be proved or disproved, if we are to believe state-
ments made by Prof. Henry Russell of Princeton.
The Crocker Expedition to Australia has obtained
data which is expected to show the worth of Ein-
stein's ideas. Photographs of stars and groups of
stars were taken and by comparison of these and by
accurate measurements deductions will be made which
may present revelations to the scientific world.
Super Vacuum Tubes
The largest vacuum tube ever made, has just been
developed in the Research Laboratories of the General
Electric Company. It is of one million watts capacity
(1,000 KW) and is 50 times greater than any tube now
in use. The tube weighs 60 pounds. It would light
40,000 25-watt lamps or supply energy to almost 1,500
average homes. The filament is a rod of tungsten so
large that if drawn out into filament of the size used
in the average electric lamp, it would make 50 miles
of filament; or it would make filament for 175,000 such
lamps. The light given off during the operation would
amount to 40,000 candle power.
The creation of this great unit grew out of a de-
sire to produce tubes for general power purposes, as
well as radio, and thus open up the possibility of a new
field for the vacuum tube. This development has been
in charge of Dr. A. W. Hull, noted for this vacuum
tube development work.
Professor D. L. Rich of the Physics Department.
states that Michigan's new Physics building will be the
finest and best equipped in the country, if not in the
world.






ALBERT A. ROBINSON, '69—A GREAT
BUILDER*
Having built over 5,000 miles of railroad, Albert
A. Robinson is today one of the world's great civil
engineers.
Mr. Robinson was born near the little village of
South Reading, Vermont, on October 21, 1844. His
ancestors for generations back were New Englanders.
A grandfather, Ebenezer Robinson, fought two years
for his country in the American Revolution and was
for six months confined in the notorious British prison
ship, Jersey.
His father, Ebenezer, Jr., was a country school
master, farmer, and carpenter. The soil upon which
the family had long lived was rough and stony and
farming was carried on under great difficulties; yet the
Robinsons were hard workers and were always in com-
fortable circumstances.
In the summer of 1848, when Albert was not yet
four years old, the father suddenly died of typhoid
fever. Five years later the mother and children moved
to Edgerton, Wisconsin, where Mrs. Robinson was
again married to a man named Alba Childs, a merchant.
When not in school Albert and his brothers were busy
helping in the store. Who would have predicted that
one of these boys would some day emerge from the
timber slashings of Wisconsin to build the Santa Fe
railroad and to transform a large portion of the contin-
ent with his engineering genius? But sound heredty
ever asserts itself and America is a land of opportun-
ity where great things always are waiting to be ac-
complished.
In 1865 Albert entered the University of Michigan.
He landed in Ann Arbor with $175, which had been
saved for him from his fathers estate. During his
four years in college his stepfather was able to send
him but $100 and Albert made the balance of his ex-
pense money as best he could. The first year he did
odd jobs to pay his way. But the University author-
ities soon recognized his merit, learned of the effort he
was putting forth to secure an education and did all
in their power to help him. Through their influence
he was placed, at the end of his freshman year, on the
Great Lakes surveys, and this work, besides helping to

pay his way through college, gave him some valuable
experience. While a student at Ann Arbor, Mr. Rob-
inson and two classmates roomed over what was then
Watt's jewelry store on Main Street.
Robinson was graduated from the University in
1869 with both the collegiate and engineering degrees
of Bachelor of Science and Civil Engineering and in
1871 was awarded the degree of Master of Science.
Twnty-nine years later, as president of the Mexican
Central Railroad, he was called back to Ann Arbor to
receive the degree of Doctor of Laws, which is the
manner in which a University confers its highest hon-
ors upon those who have achieved great things for the
good of humanity.
Mr. Robinson's railroad career began in May,
1869, when he entered the employ of the St. Joseph &amp;
Denver City Railroad. He started in at the bottom,
serving first as an axman for the company engineers.
He advanced rapidly. First he became a chainman,
then levelman, transitman, office engineer, locating
engineer and assistant engineer. All these promotions
came within two years. So brilliant a showing did he
make that three universities—Kansas, Illinois, and
Northwestern—all tried to engage his services as a pro-
fessor of civil engineering. But he proposed to stick to
railroad work.
In 1871 Mr. Robinson entered the service of the
Santa Fe Railroad as an assistant engineer. At this
time the road was scarcely 100 miles long. Twenty-
two years later, when he resigned as vice-president
and general manager, the Santa Fe had grown into a
system more than 9,000 miles in extent, and over half
of this system had been constructed by this brilliant
engineer and his subordinates.
On May I, 1893, Mr. Robinson left the Santa Fe
to become president of the Mexican Central. This
position he held until 1906, when he retired. lie had
proven himself an able administrator as well as a great
engineer. Not only did he add 950 miles to the Mex-
ican Central, but he operated it under great difficulties.
He was forced to buy railroad supplies on a gold
standard while the revenues of his road were in silver
of a continually diminishing standard. Mr. Robinson
was equal to the crisis, however, and kept his road out
of a receivership. He did more than that. When he
went to the Mexican Central, the stock was selling for
(37)

five cents a share; its bonds where at forty-three.
When he resigned the stock sold at fifty and the bonds
at eighty.
Since 1906 Mr. Robinson has lived in retirement in
Topeka, where his estate is one of the beauty spots of
the city. To visit his home is to see a rare collection of
art treasures. To meet and know Mr. Robinson is to
find nature's finest handicraft in -man. And through-
out the Santa Fe system one ever hears among old
employees this comment: "A.A.Robinson? lie was
the greatest builder of them all."

HOW PAPER IS MADE
(Continued from Page 20)
lander or beating engine where the individual fibres
are separated and drawn out. The percentages of
the different kinds of pulp are regulated by the
grade of paper desired. Into the beater are put
also any clay or loading material, rosin sizing and
alum for water-proofness, and colors to match the
shade required. Aniline dyes are largely used in
the paper industry for coloring. The beating is
continued for an hour or two and the stock is then
usually run through a Jordan engine to further re-
fine the fibres. From here it is taken to the screens
of the paper machine, which take out dirt and
slivers, and it is then dropped into the flow box of
the paper machine.
Most of the paper in this country is made on a
Fourdrinier machine. The sheet of paper is formed
on a travelling continuous wire screen made of brass or
bronze and containing 60 to 70 wires to the inch
each way. This allows the water to drop filter through
but the fibres are retained. A slight side shake
helps the formation of the sheet. The stock is held
from running off the sides of the wire screen by rubber
deckle straps which run with the wire screen. The wire
screen runs over a number of brass rolls called table
rolls which take out some of the water and as it travels
a number of section boxes take out still more. Just
before it leaves the wire screen the sheet runs between
a brass roll which carries the back end of the con-
tinuous wire and a brass roll on top of this which is
covered with a heavy woolen jacket. This is called
the couch and it presses still more water from the
wet sheet so that by the time it gets to the end of
the wire it is strong enough to carry its own weight.
Careful Drying is Necessary
The sheet is carried over a woolen felt apron which
runs between heavy press rolls and still more water is
squeezed out of it. Most machines have two or
three sets of press rolls and the sheet should be
about 30% dry when it goes to the dryers.
The dryers consist of a number of revolving
hollow cylinders with steam inside and with cotton
felts running over the outside to carry the paper
and hold it up to the dryer. These are usually
heated by the exhaust steam from the engine which
drives the machine but some live steam is also re-
quired at times. From the dryers the paper passes
through a number of heavy steel rolls which have
been carefully ground to give the desired finish.
It is then ready to be reeled up and cut into rolls or
sheets as desired.
In an article of this length it is impossible to go
into any detail on an industry as complicated as the
paper industry but an attempt has been made to
touch on a few of the prominent points. There are
a number of other types of paper machines but
they are all more or less a modification of the
Fourdrinier type mentioned.
Great advances have been made in the paper in-
dustry in the last generation and there ,is every
prospect that it will continue to increase its stand-
ard of efficiency. Competition is keen and the
technical man is rapidly being accorded the recog-
nition he deserves here as in our other industries.
During the first six months of 1921, according to
figures first made public by the United States De-
partment of Commerce, Germany shipped more
electrical goods into Spain than any other country,
including the United States.

COPPER
(Continued from Page 30)
from copper whose oxygen content is not exactly
what it should be. It is very difficult to determine ex-
actly the temperature of the copper as it is coming
from the copper furnaces, and the methods employed
for testing the conductivity of the copper have not been
developed to the point of securing the test within a
reasonable time after the pouring of the test bar.
Recovery of the Impurities
It has already been mentioned that certain of the
impurities go into solution in the electrolyte while oth-
ers drop to the bottom of the tank. As the electrolyte,
which is dilute sulphuric acid, becomes laden with im-
purities it is pumped off to the evaporator house, where
the water is evaporated and the iron precipitated out
and the nickel finally precipitated out as nickel sul-
phate. The selenium and telurium are removed in this
same evaporation process and are converted either into
metallic selenium and telurium or into selenium and
telurium sulphate. The telurium is in demand for the
manufacture of red glass and is provided to the glass
makers as telurium sulphate. There is very little de-
mand for the selenium and most of it is let go to
waste. The nickel sulphate is taken from the evapor-
ator house to the nickel furnace house where it is first
charged into a revolving furnace about 30 feet by 30
inches in diameter, lined with brick and inclined at
an angle of about 10 degrees. This furnace is fired
by oil from the lower end and the nickel sulphate is
shovelled in at the upper end. As the furnace revolves
the sulphate is gradually heated to a high temperature
and converted into a brownish nickel oxide which
drops out at the lower end. This nickel oxide is then
charged with charcoal into an electric furnace about
eight feet square with large carbon leads at the top
and bottom. After six or eight hours the metallic
nickel is drawn from this electric furnace and cast into
cakes about 12 inches square by one-half inch thick for
delivery to the market for nickel plating, making nickel
steel, etc.
Slime
When the cathodes and anodes have been removed
from the tanks and the solution drawn off, the mud or
slime at the bottom is carefully shovelled out and put
through a pressure filter process which removes most
of the electrolyte. This slime is then taken to the silver
refinery where it is first dried in iron pans about 14 by
24 inches in steam-heated driers. This drying removes
the acid or electrolyte that remained and leaves it a
grey powder. This grey powder is then wetted down
with water and charged into a furnace known as the
Dore furnace, which is about 4 feet wide by 3 feet
high by 10 feet long, the charging being done through
the roof. The furnace is fired by oil as the larger
copper furnaces and in a few hours the charge of
several tons of slime is melted to a brassy looking met-
al. Sand, lime and soda are shovelled into this, grad-
ually fluxing the iron and other impurities out and
leaving a lake of combined silver, gold, platinum, etc.
This metal is then removed by a hand ladle and poured
into small flat moulds by which it is converted into
cakes about 12 inches square by one-quarter inch thick.
This Dore resembles nickel perhaps more than any of
the metals which it contains.
The cakes of Dore are charged into a hemispherical
cast-iron vat about three feet in diamater under which
three oil fires are installed. As soon as the desired
charge has been put in the vat concentrated sulphuric
acid is poured in until it covers the charge and the
whole boiled until the mixture of metal has been dis-
solved. When the mixture has been dissolved to the
maximum all of the silver is in solution in the acid,
while the gold, platinum, palladium, etc., have drop-
ped to the bottom of the vat. The solution is then
siphoned off into a lead-lined wood tank in which
cakes of copper about 12 by 18 by i inches have been
placed over the floor. This tank is partially filled with
water and as the sulphuric acid solution is siphoned in
the liquid in the tank is agitated violently by means of
steam. This violent agitation results in the dropping
of the silver by the acid and the dissolving of the cop-
per from the copper cakes. The result is therefore
that on completion of the siphoning of the acid and
thorough agitation, the silver has been percipitated out
as grey granular pure silver and a percentage of the
copper plates has gone into solution in the sulphuric
acid. This concentrated sulphuric acid with copper in
solution is the source of the sulphuric acid for the two
electrolyte refineries.
Disposal of Refuse
After the acid has become charged with the sul-
phur, vegetable matter, etc., and has been evaporated
in the evaporator house for the removal of nickel, etc.,
it is normally unfit for further use in the refinery and
is sold to phosphate manufacturers who may allow ap-
proximately $9.00 per ton and charge in return $12.00
per ton for pure concentrated sulphuric acid, which
starts in th refinery in the process just described. The
arsenic, sulphur, and particles of vegetable matter in
the sulphuric acid are not objectionable in the man-
ufacture of phosphate fertilizers.
The granular silver precipitated out in the lead-
lined tank is compressed into cakes under a hydraulic
press and charged into a small oil fired furnace similar
to the Dore furnace. It is simply melted here and
poured into cakes weighing about 90 pounds for de-
livery to the mint. It is interesting to note here that
a penalty is imposed by the mint for gold or platinum
in the silver since they must remove it.

Aircraft as an Engineering Problem
By Ralph H. Upson
(GRAVITATION, like all good things, is sometimes
troublesome. As it cannot be removed, it must
be counterbalanced. This is a common function of
all engineering structures, and the best classification
of a structure seems usually to be found in the method
by which the force of gravity is resisted, such as fixed
connections, rolling contact, displacement of fluid,
dynamic reactions, etc.
An airship floats by displacing its own weight of
air. As the volume of the gas is identical with that
of the air it displaces, it is convenient for most sub-
sequent calculations to eliminate the weight of the gas
by subtracting it at once from the weight of an equal
volume of air. Thus the total weight of structure,
power plant, "useful load," etc., is usually represented
as balanced by an equal "lift" of gas. But this is only
the beginning of the problem, a means to an end,
which is not to get into the air but to go through it.
Unfortunately, the latter requirement is the one that
introduces 95 per cent of the structural complications
in an airship.
Balance of Hull Stress
Going at once, then, to the larger problem, the first
requirement is, of course, a balance of all forces act-
ing on the hull. These may be classified roughly as
follows:
1. Lift and load, acting vertically.
2. Resistance and thrust, acting horizontally (or
axially, to be more precise).
3. Aerodynamic forces on hull and control surfaces
due to angularity or turning motion. These are sub-
stantially perpendicular to the axis.
4. Forces of inertia. These may be in any direc-
tion, but are usually transverse and balanced by the
forces in item 3.
5. Outside and inside pressures. The algebraic dif-
ference between these throughout any one transverse
section is balanced against itself through the medium
of the structure.
The determination of the above forces, especially
those of item 3, is a whole subject in itself which we
cannot even touch upon here, except to set down some
of the more general results. Perhaps the most inter-
esting of these is the fact that aerodynamic forces
commonly produce more serious bending moments
than does the entire weight of the airship, fully loaded.
These particular forces are serious only when pro-
ducing a transverse component (/. c, perpendicular to
the axis), due to gusts or to a departure from the
theoretical straight flight conditions.
The direct head resistance is but a very small frac-
tion, often less than two per cent, of the transverse
resistance. The curve of outside pressure distribution
for a good shape is a maximum of the nose, drops
sharply to zero at a point not very far back, is a nega-
tive or zero throughout the central portion, and finally
becomes positive again at the tail. This positive and
very helpful "push" integrates to a force quite com-
parable with the opposite one at the nose. It puts the
hull under local compression and reduces its net re-
sistance largely to that of skin friction. In fact, the
resistance of the hull alone is usually not more than
half of the total, the entire balance being due to
small parasite parts such as cars and fins.

Although the net resultant of the nose and tail pres-
sure is small, the individual magnitude of the pres-
sure, especially that at the nose, is an important and
sometimes dominating factor. The nose is the critical
point of most "non-rigids" which hold their shape by
internal pressure. The best example of a pure non-
rigid is a "kite-balloon" used for captive observation
purposes, where even the fins are free from rigid ele-
ments. When the nose is held from "cupping in" by
Although a rigid airship might be made in many dif-
ferent ways, the Zeppelin type is the only one that
has had a consistent development. Hence, most people
when referring to a "rigid" really mean a "Zeppelin,"
which, considered as a type, includes the Schutte-Lanz
and the various British rigids. The best example of
a Zeppelin type ship under construction at the present
time is our own "ZR-i" being built by the United
States Navy at Lakehurst, N. J. This fine ship is

means of internal pressure alone, it puts the whole
envelope under an unnecessarily severe tension merely
to take care of a small area at one end. For this rea-
son, the nose of a non-rigid airship is usually stiffened
by a local structure of wood or metal. Here we have
the beginning of a rigid hull structure.
The next step is usually to run a certain amount of
stiffening longitudinally of the hull for convenience in
attaching the various loads, and to permit leaving the
ship in its shed at zero pressure or to handle it as a
free balloon without any buckling due to the load.
The variation in shape for different pressures is still
considerable, although not so great as with a non-
rigid, hence the term "semi-rigid."
Carrying the same process a little further, we may
distribute structural members all around the hull and
hold the shape rigidly constant under all conditions.
rapidly nearly completion and is just now at its most
interesting phase (in an engineering sense), the frame
being practically finished but still largely free from its
fabric cover and not complicated by too many details.
It is undoubtedly one of the most stimulating works
of engineering to be seen anywhere.
The interesting thing about such a structure is that
it carries almost to an extreme the very same refine-
ments of materials, design, and construction that are
desirable, within proper limits, in any structure. Com-
pare it, for example, with its nearest relative, the
steamship. For an equal "gross lift" the airship must
be roughly 1,000 times bigger in volume, yet its struc-
tural weight must still be made comparable to that of
the dimensionally smaller steamship.
Who will undertake to design a bridge with a "fac-
tor of safety" of two? It is done in the "ZR-i," and

with perfect safety, providing the calculations are
correct (of which I have no doubt). One might well
argue that such a low factor would be insufficient to
take care of imperfections in materials and the human
element in the construction. Then let him who thinks
he has an "airtight" system of inspection go to Lake-
hurst and see one that is "gas-tight"! Likewise, the
engineer who delights in technical problems will prob-
ably find more there than he ever saw at one time
before; and if he takes pride in doing a job well he
will see there a work of art.
But to come back to the construction itslef: the
material of the frame is duralumin, which has the
strength of ordinary steel with about one-third of the
weight. The tension members, however, are high
tensile steel wire. The structure is so arranged that
all interior transverses are concentrated at certain
points to accommodate a series of 20 fabric gas cell:
which are in direct contact with each other through-
out the length of the hull. One of these cells has just
been successfully tested with helium gas at the de-
signed pressure.
The frame is covered on the outside with doped
fabric to make a smooth surface and keep out the
water. But special provisions are made for letting ir
the air in order to maintain a fairly constant internal
pressure below the gas which, paradoxically enough,
is more important in this "ship" than in a non-rigid,
even though its normal operating pressure in actual
figures happens to be zero. The importance of this
may be best appreciated from the fact that if the
outer hull wer,e shut tight the suction caused by a
descent of the ship through a height equal to its own
diameter would cause collapse. The gas pressure in
the inner cells is prevented from exceeding a minute

fraction of an atmosphere by large automatic valves
which open at the predetermined maximum pressure.
Toward the extreme stern of the ship are the mas-
sive yet delicately constructed fins and control sur-
faces. The size of these is governed not by what is
necessary to turn the ship but by what is necessary
to keep it from turning. One of the rudders alone is
big enough to make a fair-sized airplane.
There is no space here even to mention the many
interesting details in this ship, with its 680 feet of
length, 1,800 horsepower, 2,100,000 cubic feet of gas,
and 140,000 pounds full load weight. The question

which naturally comes into one's mind is whether
there is much more room for improvement. It is
probably true that the possibilities for further im-
provement of this type of ship, by mere refinement of
engineering detail, are quite limited. The big im-
provements of the future will undoubtedly be made
by getting back again to fundamental principles and
combining the essential elements in such a way that
the tremendous strains ar,e largely eliminated. This
will have the decided advantage that the factors of
safety will be so increased that the present extreme
delicacy of construction will not be necessary. Thi?
improvement upon design and construction canno'
help but exert a stimulant upon the advancement of
all types of aircraft. The chief concern of the pres-
ent is the successful solution of these engineering
problems.

S time goes on, I find it more difficult to speak
of retiring from my forty-three years of business
lfie. In fact, instead of retiring, I find myself drawn
more and more into concerns, each of which involves
new responsibilities. But the greater the responsibili-
ties, the less I find of the element of personal super-
vision and the less I enjoy my new work. The thing
that has given me the most pleasure and that I am the
most proud of is that I keep finding friends, and friends
—and yet more friends on every hand.
You want me to tell you how you can succeed in
life. I know that it is very difficult to convince the
great majority of people that men who are in active
pursuits of life have any other object in view than the
making of money. That is a great mistake. The real
leaders of industry, and the real men in life, and the
real successes in life are not always the men who have
lots of money or a great fortune.
My idea of the successful life is the man who has
successfully accomplished the objects for which he set
out, to do something that is worthy of a real American
man. Money is often a matter of chance or good for-
tune, and is not the mark of a successful life. It is
not the thing that brings a throb of pleasure or a thrill
into my life. And I would not pose as a successful
man if that was to be the measure. But when I look
about me and see the multitude of friends that I have
after forty years of business association with men,
when I see the great lines of smoking stacks and blaz-
ing furnaces that have come into being because of my
interests and activity in life, and when I see a work
that I set out to do successfully accomplished and meet-
ing the approval of my fellow men, then a real thrill
comes into my heart and I feel that I have done some-
thing worth while. The money you do not think about
as long as you have enough to pay your bills and keep
your business going. The captains of industry do not
keep on working for the sake of making money, but
for the love of completing a job successfully. Men
who typify the ideal business man, in my mind, are
Mr. Carnegie, the elder Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Baker,
the younger Mr. Rockefeller, and Judge Gary.
One of the dearest friends that I ever had in life,
Andrew Carnegie, used to say to me when I went to
him with my balance sheet and showed him how many
hundred thousand dollars we had made that month or
year, "That's interesting, but show me your cost
sheet." That is the mark of successful manufacturing,
how economically and how well you do a thing, not
how much money you make in the doing of it. So his
*Publishing rights held by the E. M. C. A.
mark—and he was a wise man—his mark of successful
industry is my mark of a successful life. Set out with
some definite purpose in life and accomplish that pur-
pose. There is little that the human mind can conceive
that is not possible of accomplishment. The thing to
do is to make up your mind what you are going to
drive for, and let nothing stand in the way of its ulti-
mate accomplishment.
Now, in my long experience in business life and
association with men, there are some fundamental
tilings that must not be overlooked. If I were asked
to say the most important things that lead to a success-
ful life, I should say that, first of all, was integrity—-
unimpeachable integrity. No man can ever do any-
thing of any great value in life, and have the confidence
and approval of his fellow men or be successful in his
undertakings with other business men, if he doesn't
have the reputation of being a man of honor and
integrity.
I am going to speak of a young man that I regard
as the most successful young man I have ever known.
And if I did not regard him as the most successful
young men that I know, he would not be the president
of the Bethlehem Steel Company. I am going to
speak of a young man that I have known since he was
a man your age—I refer to Eugene Grace. You may
have heard of him. He came from Lehigh University.
When I first knew him he was a shoveler of coal with
an electric crane. I followed his career on and on
and on. And whatever may have been said of Mr.
Grace, you could always depend upon it absolutely that
when Mr. Grace said a thing you would know the abso-
lute facts, good, bad, or indifferent. And today Mr.
Grace stands among the great business men of New
York and this country, with the reputation of being a
man of absolute integrity and a man in whom every-
body can place the greatest possible confidence.
A man must also be a true democrat, and not an
aristocrat who condescends to talk with anyone. The
educated man must not get the idea that education
necessarily makes him superior to any other skilled man
who has devoted his life to mastering one business.
When I first entered the business world in 1879, the
United States was producing only one million tons of
steel a year; now we produce fifty million. Never was
the opportunity and the reward so great as it now is
in this reconstructed era. The hardest struggle of all is
to be something different from what the average man is.
I don't believe in "super-men," for the world is full of
capable men, but it's the fellow with determination
that wins out.

Bet on the United States if you must bet at all, for
any good enterprise in this country is worth more than
six or seven per cent. Put your all into any business
which depends for its success on your own brains and
determination to win. Be not fearful in borrowing
money; I have borrowed more money than any other
man in the United States and on less collateral.
Be sure to go into a business that will keep your
interest, for you can't handle working men success-
fully if you only pretend to be interested in them.
If I were able to give you whatever I wanted, I
would wish that you might have a rugged constitution,
a desire to work, and the great American characteristic
of driving onward.
Any man who goes into anything in life and does it
better than the average will have a successful life. If
he does it worse than the average his life will not be
successful. And no business can exist in which suc-
cess cannot be won on that basis.
Another important thing is loyalty. Be loyal. What
measure of success I may have won in life I attribute
to the loyalty I had for a dear old friend who was my
first steel master, whom you perhaps have never heard
of, Captain Bill Jones.
Captain Jones was a great mechanic, just a natural
genius at mechanical things. No education at all. He
knew nothing of engineering or chemistry or the sci-
ences. Now, I was thrown in, fortunately, with him
I made up my mind that I could be very useful to that
man by learning things that he could not learn, and
above all, by being loyal to him and never letting the
world know that the things for which he received
credit were not his own creation. Did you ever stop
to think that a great man in life, who has won great
acclaim and great reputation, is the very man who is
willing to share and give the honor to others in the
doing of the things that made him great? The man
that will selfishly stand alone and proclaim that he is
the man who has done these things never is the man
who really did them. My own experience is that there
is no real effort in life that is not done better under
encouragement and approval of your fellow men. A
man goes along then with greater confidence. You
must learn to let others share with you in that which
you are doing, and honor and credit will be reflected
upon you for so doing.
Marshal Foch, the great commander, once said to
me: "This great military staff is like an orchestra, and
each one fills his place. Hach is equally important in
the functioning of the whole. If the baton is in my
hands it is merely a matter of chance, but we shall see
to it that each man in this staff gets recognition for
that which is due." You never heard a great man say,
"I did this," or "I will do that."
In the management of my great enterprises I have
yet to find fault with any man. If a man is such that
you must find fault with him to get the best out of
him, he is not a man to be desired in an organization.
Show me the man that will do his best under approval,
and I will show you the man that has within him the
elements for successful going ahead.
Now, to come back to loyalty. Be loyal to the people
with whom you associate at the start. When this good
Captain Jones came to the end of his life's work, do
you not suppose it was worth more to me than any-
thing else to have him say, "That is the man that
helped me do these things"? Remember always that
it will but attract attention and credit to yourself to
share it with those who help you. Be loyal when you
start life, wherever you start. Make your employer
feel truthfully that you are sincere with him; that you
are going to promote his interests; that you are going
to stand for the things he represents; that you are
proud of being a member of his staff, and there is
nothing that will reap you a richer reward. Loyalty
above all!
There are other things in life than mere work. I
believe an appreciation of the finer things in life, the
learning to know the beauties of literature and art and
music, will help any man in his career. A man to
carry on a successful business must have imagination.
He must see things as in a vision, a dream of the whole
thing. You can cultivate this faculty only by an appre-
ciation of the finer things in life. No active business
life, whether it is manufacturing or something else,
should prevent you from enjoying the beauties of life.
These finer things will contribute to your success.
Be friendly. When you have friends you will know
there is somebody who will stand by you. You know
the old saying that if you have a single enemy you will
find him everywhere. It doesn't pay to make enemies.
Lead the life that will make you kindly and friendly
to everyone about you, and you will be surprised at
what a happy life you will live.
I want to tell you a little more about this man Grace,
because one often sees the points in a successful life
best by analyzing a single individual. I told you of
his great faculty of making good, no matter in what
position he was placed. This boy went on and on.
Above all, he worked hard with the brain that had
been trained in the university to think and concentrate
upon the subject that he was thinking about until he
had reached a satsifactory conclusion. Now that is the
great point, to concentrate and think upon the problem
in mind until you have reached a satisfactory conclu-
sion in your own mind, and then finally go ahead. If
you have made a mistake, all right. Never find fault
with a man because he has made a mistake. It is only
a fool that makes the same mistake the second time.
I tell a story of my own experience with Mr. Carnegie,
as showing what this might mean.
As chief engineer of the works, I had just built a
converting mill. I went to him and said to him: "If
you will give me the money to build this mill I can save


March, 1923

50 cents a ton." Of course he provided the money,
and the mill was built. He came out to see it. I
walked around with him. He saw the look of disap-
pointment in my face and said: "Charlie, there is
something wrong here. What is it?" I said: "It is
exactly what I told you, and it is better than I told
you. We save more than I said. But I don't mind
saying that if I had to do the whole thing over again
I would do it so and so. I made a mistake in that
particular." He said: "Can you change it?" I said:
"No." He said: "What does it mean?" I said: "It
means tearing it down and doing it over again." He
said: "Go ahead and do it. Don't make the same mis-
take a second time." Do you suppose, if he had been
a fault-finding man, I ever would have told him. Not
at all. He brought out the best in me. When that mill
was torn down and a second took its place it was as
great a success over the first as the first had been over
the old one.
Now, in my own establishment you will be interested
to know something alx,ut how we do things. You
boys will all probably have to start to work upon a sal-
ary. But the quicker you get out of working for a
salary the better for all concerned. In our works at
Bethlehem and San Francisco, and all over the United
States, I adopted this system: I pay the managers of
our works practically no salary. I make them partners
in the business, only I don't let them share in the
efforts of any other man. For example, if a man is
manager of a blast furnace department he makes profit
out of the successful conduct of his department, but I
don't allow him to share in the prosperity of some
other able man in some other department of the estab-
lishment. I give him a percentage of what he saves
or makes in the department immediately under his own
control and management. For example, if it takes a
dollar a ton to make pig iron, and it takes him a dollar
a ton to make pig iron, I say to him:
"Well, you are no better than the average manager
the country over; therefore you are entitled to only
the usual wages. But if you can make pig iron at 90
cents a ton you are entitled to share with me in a large
part of the profits. And if you make it for 40 cents
or 50 cents a ton you share to a very large degree."
Therefore, I don't care how much a man earns. The
more he earns the better I like him. And I pay in what
I call bonuses to the various superintendents and man-
agers of the different establishments more money for
their successful management than I pay the stockhold-
ers of the concern in dividends. And it will surprise
you to know the great sums of money that some of
these men make. I would be afraid to tell you, for
fear of discouraging you in your start in life. But I
don't mind saying that forty, fifty, sixty, a hundred
thousand dollars a year for these men is not infrequent.
And in the case of men like Mr. Grace—well, many,
many times that.
If you have any influence in the world to get you a
start in life, don't use it. The worst thing that can
happen to a man is to start life with influence. He
has got to do twice as well as the fellow that starts
upon his own merits, because, after all, it depends on
the general opinion of all those around you as to how
competent and successful you are, and when everybody
says that you do well because of the influence back of
you, then you have got to do twice as well as otherwise.
If you are going into any manufacturing establishment,
don't go there by reason of any influence you may have.
Start upon your own merits, and start in some lowly
position, no matter what it is. Be a laborer, if you will.
I don't know but that is the best way to start.
This great war has taught us many things. The one
thing it has taught us above everything else is that the
true life is the life of modern democracy and simplicity,
that it is not one of show or of extravagance, that we
are men because we are men and because we have the
true instincts of men, and we are not men because we
are rich, or because we occupy a high social position,
or because we have influence.
Go at your work. You may not find yourself the
first year. You may start at work that you think will
not be agreeable to you. Do not hesitate to change.
If you find that it is not according to your tastes and
ultimate ambitions, then change and go into something
that is more pleasant. No man can be successful at
work if he doesn't find the work he has to do pleasant.
No man can ever do a thing well that he is not inter-
ested in. When you start in life, if you find you are
wrongly placed don't hesitate to change, but don't
change because troubles come up and difficulties arise.
You must meet and overcome and conquer them. And
in meeting and overcoming and conquering them you
will make yourself stronger for the future.
Then go on and select your work. Let us suppose
you become a craneman. Suppose you become a clerk
in a lawyer's office. Give the best that is in you.
Let nothing stand in the way of your going on.
Opportunities must come naturally, and the only
way that they can come naturally is to give your whole
heart, give your whole soul, give your every thought,
give your every act to the accomplishment of what you
are going to undertake. If you will but make up your
mind and determination to go through with what you
undertake, you will do that which will bring you more
genuine pleasure, satisfaction, and comfort in life than
anything else you will ever do.

roads. The Madrid-Zaragoza-Alicante Railway will

¥ N Alaska, the construction, repair, and mainte-
nance of roads, bridges, trails, and related works is
entrusted by law to the Alaska Road Commission. In
addition to the writer, Major John C. Gotwals is Chief
Engineer, and Captain P. A. Agnew, Secretary-Treas-
urer of the Commission. Prior to its organization in
1905, there were in the whole of the Territory less
than a dozen miles of what might be called wagon
road, with a few hundred miles of pioneer trail, mostly
constructed by expeditions under the War Department.
In 1919, the Territorial Legislature appropriated
year south coast ports to all inhabited parts of the
Territory.
This system consists at present of 1,101 miles of
wagon road, 756 miles of sled road, 3,721 miles of
permanent trail, and 712 miles of temporary flagged
trail. In the classification of the Commission, wagon
roads are any roads cleared, grubbed, ditched, graded,
and drained sufficiently to accommodate wagon traffic.
Light motor vehicles are now using these roads in
increasing numbers. This requires a gravel surface
at an increased first cost, but with an eventual saving

A Poor Means of Transportation
$400,000 for roads, for two years, and in 1921, $240,-
000. Of the first appropriation, about one-half was
allotted to cooperative projects with the Alaska Road
Commission. Of the second appropriation, about
$200,000 are being expended under the supervision
of the Alaska Road Commission.
Present Road and Trail System
During its eighteen years of existence, it has
expended about $8,000,000 upon a system of 6,290
miles of roads and trails, reaching from open-all-the-
in annual maintenance charges. Sled roads are cleared
and graded like wagon roads, but not grubbed. They
are drained only sufficiently to prevent their destruc-
tion by the summer rains. Their wearing surface is
of snow. Double bob-sleds, drawn by two, four, etc.,
horses haul heavy loads over these roads as well as
over the wagon roads in winter time. During the past
two seasons caterpillar tractors were successfully used
during the winter time, and such traffic is expected to
increase. Trails include any construction less than the
above, suitable for dog sled or single horse-driven dou-
ble-enders in winter and pack trains in summer.
Except when river surfaces are used, some work is
always necessary to permit the use of dog teams.

Flagged trails represent cutoffs across frozen lakes,
arms of the sea, etc. The marks are necessary to pre-
vent travelers from getting lost in bad weather.
The Territory of Alaska is about nine times the size
of the State of Washington, or practically one-fifth the

Dragline Handling Gravel
size of the United States proper. If it were super-
imposed upon the United States, the tip of southeast-
ern Alaska would touch Charleston, S. C, and the tip
of the Aleutian Chain, Los Angeles, Calif.; north and
south, it would extent from Duluth, Minn., to Dallas,
Texas. The coast line of Alaska aggregates 26,000
miles, or one-fourth greater than the entire continental
United States. Due to its peculiar shape and to the
difficulties and uncertainties of transportation, it would
require over two years of continuous traveling by the
best means of transportation procurable for a single
individual to inspect the entire system of roads and
trails for the maintenance of which the Alaska Road
Commission is responsible.
Varied Activities of the Commission
In addition to road and trail building for the Fed-
eral Government and for the Territory, the members
of the Alaska Road Commission are charged with river
and harbor improvements in the Territory and inspec-
tion and permits for all structures upon its navigable
waters, including floating and fixed fish traps for the
great Alaskan fishing industry. The President of the
Commission is also detailed for consultation or to
superintend the construction or repair of lighthouses
and other aids to navigation authorized by Congress
in the Sixteenth (Alaska) Lighthouse District, under
the Secretary of Commerce, and as the War Depart-
ment representative upon the Inter-Departmental
The total expenditures during the past fiscal year
for roads and trails amounted to $683,247.68, of which
$236,251.91 was for construction and $446,995.77 for
maintenance. Work was performed upon 5,990 miles
of the system. The Alaska Road Commission has
never professed to build hard-surfaced roads, nor
would any such construction be justified in view of
the great extent of country to be covered with very
meager resources. In many isolated localities the erec-
tion of a cableway and cage across a glacial stream or
the setting of stakes across the open tundra is a matter
of life and death to the inhabitants.
In 1920, the present Commission took charge, and
was faced with the need of reconstructing and rehabil-
itating a large part of the old routes, with the require-
ment of a more substantial type of construction and a
road so surfaced as to stand light truck traffic, with
the necessity for a system of highway feeders to the
Government Railroad, with the need of extensions and
improvements to the system in all parts of the Terri-
tory, and all this with a greatly increased cost of labor,
materials, and supplies. In its first report it recom-
mended an expenditure of ten million dollars during
the succeeding ten years, about two-thirds during the
first five years, and the remaining third on a decreasing
scale during the second five years. Work is being con-
ducted upon this program, though Congress has not
yet increased its appropriation sufficiently to warrant
the expectation that the program will be completed
within the time limit proposed.
The Richardson Highway
The most important project of the Commission is
the Valdez-Circle Military Road, or Richardson High-
way, extending from Valdez, an open-all-the-year south
coast port, to Circle, on the Upper Yukon River, a dis-
tance of 531 miles, or about the distance from Boston
to Richmond or from Vancouver to Banff. This road
is now passable for automobiles throughout except for
79 miles between Chatanika and Miller House, on the
portage between the Yukon and Tanana Rivers. Con-
struction upon this section is actively under way. The
371 miles between Valdez and Fairbanks were passable
for dog teams in 1909, for a light horse-drawn wagon
in 1911, and in 1913 the first automobile made the
through overland trip, which involves crossing the
Coast or Chugach Range through Thompson Pass at
an elevation of 2,750 feet, and the main Rocky Moun-
tains, or Alaskan Range, through Isabelle Pass, at an
elevation of 3,300 feet. From Willow Creek, 92 miles
north of Valdez, there is a 39-mile cut-off to Chitina,
at mile 130 north of Cordova on the Copper River and
Northwestern Railroad.
The Winter Mail Trails
Of even more importance than the wagon roads to
the economic life of the interior are the winter sled
roads and trails, over which all mail, express, and per-
sonnel are handled. Even heavy freight can be han-
dled by bob-sled in the winter time more economically
than by truck in the summer time. Twenty-five cents
per pound is a not uncommon charge for handling pro-

visions and miscellaneous supplies over unimproved
trails, and a community considers itself lucky when
the through rate from the railroad or river landing is
reduced to less than ten cents. Data collected by the
Commission indicate that transportation charges upon
freight actually passing over its roads and trails have
been reduced over $2,000,000 annually, due to the
improved facilities provided. It is doubtful, however,
if anything like that amount of freight would have
been transported without the roads, and the indirect
loss which would have been occasioned by the restric-
tion on output and development if the roads did not
exist cannot be estimated.
The Talkeetna-Cache Creek project affords a strik-
ing example of this. For years the Commission had
maintained a crude pack trail into this district, and the
production in 1919 and 1920 was only alxnit $140,000
in gold. In 1920, the Commission expended $75,000
on a 42-mile route to the Government Railroad, open-
ing up the entire mileage for sled traffic, and is con-
tinuing its improvement to road standard. The fol-
lowing winter 500 tons went into the district by bob-
sled at a saving of three cents per pound, or $30,000
over the old rate. As a result, several hydraulic plants
are being installed and a hydroelectric plant is being
built to furnish power for a dredge. Last winter the

Slinging First Cable
freight amounted to 800 tons and the saving was
$48,000. In the near future this district will be one
of the biggest producers along the Government Rail-
road, as the ground has been prospected and proven
for years.
Highway Feeders to Government Railroad
The most important new work included in the ten-
year program is the provision of road and trail feeders
to the Government Railroad. During its ten years of
operation prior to the selection of a route and the
initiation of construction on the Government Railroad
project, the Alaska Road Commission had done work
upon the following transportation routes in the area
now contiguous to the Government Railroad: Seward-
Kenai Lake, Mile 29-Moose Pass, Mile 34-Hope, Kern
Creek-Knik, Knik-Rainy Pass, Knik-Willow Creek,
McDougal-Cache Creek, and a complete system of
trails reaching from Fairbanks to practically all inhab-
ited parts of Alaska.
As soon as the route for the railroad was determined,

Winter Travel—Mt. McKinley Peak
interest centered in that region and more and more
attention and funds were devoted to highway feeders
to the prospective railroad. However, the area within
one hundred miles of the Government Railroad on both
sides constitutes only about one-sixth of Alaska in area
or population. Congress was already committed to the
general development of Alaska by the provision of a
system of roads and trails covering all sections. To
abandon the other five-sixths of Alaska in favor of the
railroad area would in effect turn the railroad into a
direct liability instead of a prospective asset. To date,
Congress has declined to authorize special relief for
the railroad and adheres to its general development
policy.
However, using its existing system as a nucleus, the
Alaska Road Commission has to date provided feeders
to the Government Railroad covering, in fact, all known
areas of possible development. Not all of these routes
are completed, but the ten-year program contemplates
their completion as well as the completion of additional
projects that may develop during the next ten years:
Seward-Kenai Lake, Seward-Radio, Seward-Nash,

HP HE relation of the electron tube to radio com-
munication is such that one is justified in con-
sidering developments in the electron tube as progress
in the field of radio. At a recent meeting of the
American Physical Society work was reported that
promises some radical changes in the construction and
operating characteristics of the three-electrode tube.
It has long been known that the thermionic emission
from the alkali metals is very copious even at com-
paratively low temperatures, but there has been no sat-
isfactory way of making them serve as the hot cathode
in the electron tube. At the research laboratory of the
General Electric Company it was found that if metallic
caesium were put into a vacuum tube containing a tung-
sten filament the caesium would vaporize to some extent
and then deposit a thin film on the tungsten. This film
would remain on the tungsten as it was heated until a
temperature of 3250 C. was reached, and then it would
evaporate. While the caesium deposit remained upon
the tungsten, the thermionic emission was determined
entirely by the caesium and not at all by the tungsten;
thus the tube was virtually furnished with a caesium
cathode.
It is of interest to try to account for the fact that
the caesium is deposited upon the tungsten and, fur-
thermore, remains upon it as the temperature is raised.
The electron affinity of tungsten is expressed as 4.52
volts; 1. c, the work per unit charge done in removing
electrons from tungsten is 4.52 joules per coulomb.
The ionizing potential of caesium is 3.9 volts, and since
this is less than the electron affinity of tungsten, an
atom of caesium, on coming near to the tungsten sur-
face, is robbed of its valence electron and becomes a
positive ion. The positive ion induces a negative charge
in the tungsten and the attraction between these two
charges causes the caesium to adhere to the surface of
the tungsten. If a minute quantity of some electro-
negative gas be put into the tube, there will be a gas
film absorbed upon the surface of the tungsten which
will increase the tendency of the positive caesium ions
to adhere to the surface, and it is then found that the
caesium will remain upon the tungsten until its tem-
perature reaches 625s C. Beyond this temperature the
caesium evaporates and the thermionic emission falls
to that of tungsten at that temperature. As the tem-
perature is reduced the caesium again appears upon
the tungsten at about 6250 C. and the thermionic cur-
rent rises to a maximum. This temperature of maximum
theirmionic emission is slightly under a red heat and
it is apparent that only a small current would he
required to heat the filament. This would result in a
decided economy of operation.
High Temperatures No Longer Needed
Two methods have been used in the past for obtain-
ing large thermionic currents without high tempera-
tures. The filament may be coated with barium and
calcium oxides, as in the case of the Western Electric
tubes, or a tungsten filament permeated with thorium
may be used. The thorium diffuses to the surface of
the hot tungsten and gives a thermionic emission largely
in excess of that obtained from pure tungsten. If it
is found possible to use the thoriated filament in com-
bination with the caesium vapor, it should be possible
to increase greatly the efficiency of the vacuum tube.
A tube containing metallic vapor has appeared upon
the market within the last month that has the charac-
teristics that would be expected if a thoriated filament
were used in an alkali vapor. The filament requires
only a quarter of the current used in other detector
tubes, while the current transmitted from plate to fila-
ment is six times as large as in the case of the standard
tubes that are so largely used for detectors and
amplifiers.
While these refinements of the electron tube for the
reception of wireless waves have been developing, the
power tubes used in transmitting have undergone some
radical changes. The Western Electric Company has
succeeded in building a tube with a water-cooled anode
that is capable of radiating twelve kilowatts, and they
are at work on another designed to radiate 100 kilo-
watts. It was a group of these water-cooled tubes that
made possible the recent epoch-making transmission of
speech from New York to London.
With these new developments already realized, there
comes the announcement that the Government has gone
into the broadcasting business and is making use of the
Arlington station for this purpose. The possibility of
broadcasting at high frequency to an entire city over
its electric lighting system has been demonstrated. The
Bureau of Standards has worked out a receiving sys-
tem that successfully substitutes alternating currents
from the lighting circuit for battery currents.
It requires but little imagination to predict many
spectacular developments in this field in the near
future; in fact, the improvements in the vacuum tube
that are already in sight are sufficient to launch an
entirely new radio program.

f'TN these days of rapid development in the new
fields of electrical science and their commercial
applications, it is easy to overlook the magnitude of
the work accomplished in the laying of deep-sea
cables." Written in 1890 by a prominent cable engi-
neer, it may well be placed in the current gossip of
1923, for the telegraph engineer of today feels that
altogether too much fuss is made over the fellow with
a weird "hook-up."
Titles, medals, and fellowships in the great and
exclusive scientific societies were cheerfully given to
the telegraph engineer of the '70's and early '8o's;
and the whole civilized world was deeply grateful to
the men who had brought the Old and New worlds
within hailing distance of each other.
They had defied and conquered the dread Atlantic
Ocean, and had even dared to conceive the "Great
Eastern," greatest ship of all times. Theirs the good
fortune to combine daring and heroism with engineer-
ing skill; and where the populace lacked information
it did not lack imagination or the desire to color things
somewhat.
A great public service had been performed; and it
is said that important trains running between Glasgow
and London were delayed several hours so that Sir
William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, might complete
instruments being made in his Glasgow laboratories
for use in the working of an Atlantic cable.
There came a period in which the inventions of
Bell and Marconi in the field of communication caught
the popular fancy, and when holders of cable stock
were decidedly nervous. Nevertheless, while the
"wireless" engineers were predicting, the cable com-
panies were being compelled to lay more, and still
more, cables and to grasp at every invention which
promised higher working speeds to meet the ever-
growing use of the cables by the public.
The development of electrical engineering in the
industrial field and in telephony and in radio-com-
munication has occasioned the application to ocean-
telegraphy of methods and apparatus from these sup-
posedly dissimilar lines of endeavor with marked suc-
cess. There are very many problems of cable-laying
and cable operation yet to be solved; the tasks of
today are harder than the tasks of yesterday, and when
accomplished bring less publicity.
To carry you into that hazardous and arduous,
though most fascinating, side of ocean-telegraphy,
cable repairing, 1 will pass over the testing of the cable
for the localization of the break and over the prep-
arations for a deep-sea repairing expedition, and arrive
with the cable ship on the "grounds."
We may arrive in bad weather after a run by "dead
reckoning" and without a cheering sun to give us our
exact position on the broad Atlantic. And we may,
perforce, bob and roll on tumultuous waves for sev-
eral weeks, and with that feeling of helplessness that
comes to one lost in a fog.
Should we arrive in fine weather, we will have deter-
mined the latitude and longitude of our position by
lunch, and may have obtained a sounding and a sample
of the bottom.

Cable Steamer in the Ice
A steel mark buoy is then moored to a mushroom-
shaped anchor by several miles of tarred manila rope
and short lengths of steel chain to mark our position.
The chain is shackled next to the anchor to withstand
the chafing on the bottom. A flagstaff, carrying a flag
and oil lamps, is fitted in a holder riveted to the top
of the buoy.
Prelimnary Sounding is Extensive
Frequent soundings, for about thirty miles along
the cable line and within one or two miles on either
side of it, are made to reveal the hills and the valleys,
the precipices and the ravines, and this work may
consume two weeks. At every sounding, a sample of

the ocean bed is obtained and the temperature of the
dark waters of the bottom is indicated on a thermom-
eter fastened to the sounding-wire. Geologists and
biologists are greatly interested in this phase of cable-
repairing operations, and perhaps the greater part of
the charted information on ocean depths has been sup-
plied by the cable companies to the admiralties.
It takes about an hour to haul in three miles of
sounding-wire, and the water clings so to the moving

wire that there is a rope of water about the thickness
of a lead-pencil reaching up from the sea to the rail
of the ship.
After the preliminary soundings have been made,
grappling for the cable is begun. A mark buoy is
moored on the line of cable and the ship steams away
about a mile, then lowers the grapnel and steams back
at a speed of about one knot on a course at right angles
to the cable line.
Virtually anchored by the dragging grapnel and
carried along by contrary tides and winds, the ship
is not easily handled from the wheelhouse.
The indications of the dynamometers, over which
the grapnel rope passes, tell fairly well what is hap-
pening at the grapnel end of the rope, and the rate
of change of the strain may tell of sudden contact
with a huge rock, of the steady dragging through ooze,
of the steady tugging of a hooked cable, of the yielding
of a weak cable, or of a grapnel swinging in a valley.
Some of the earlier cables were rather weak when
laid, some cables have been adversely affected by met-
alliferous deposits on the ocean bed, some have chafed
on jagged rocks, so that they have broken again and
again while being raised, and cable-repairing expedi-
tions have taken many months and have cost around
a million dollars. Quite ten million dollars were
expended on three of the earliest Atlantic cables before
they were finally abandoned. The 1873 cable, laid by
the "Great Eastern," is the oldest of the operated
cables.
Several forms of grapnel are available for use in
the varying conditions of contour and nature of the
bottom and of strength of cable. A popular form of
grapnel for deep-sea work is one in which, as the strain
on it increases due to the weight of the cable, several
bolts are sheared and the jaws of the grapnel close up
and cut off one side of the suspended cable and hold on
to the other side. The side that is cut off is, of course,
the side nearest to the break (which is usually a few
miles away), and the other side stretches out to the
"shore," a thousand miles away. The direction in
which the grapnel is towed across the line of cable
determines the side to be cut off by the knives on the
grapnel.
The cable is hauled slowly and steadily to the top
by a powerful "picking-up" engine, while the ship is
maneuvered to avoid undue strain on the cable due
to the drifting of the ship with winds and tides.
When the grapnel appears at the surface, men are
lowered over the bow-sheaves, in boatswain's chairs,
to make fast to the cable a rope wound on the drum
of a spare picking-up engine.
As soon as the rope has been made fast, the cable
is cut away from the grapnel with hacksaws, and it is
then hauled over the bow-sheaves to the fore-deck,
where the armor wire is stripped back from the sawed
end, and the conductor is connected to insulated wires
running to the testing-room.
The next few moments will disclose whether the
cable is electrically sound between the ship and the
shore or has parted within a few miles of the ship,
due to the strain in raising. Should good fortune be
with us, we will hear the cry, "Got the shore!" and
everyone will break into smiles. At this moment the
electrical engineer and his assistants are exceedingly
busy, and they must keep their fingers on the pulse of
the cable, as it were, until the last inch of it has been
paid out.
Signals are sent to the shore and are acknowledged
immediately. The D. R. (dielectric resistance) of the

Paving-out Drum with Fleeting Knives
cable is determined, and the C. R. (copper resistance)
measurements give the distance, in miles of cable,
between the ship and the shore. Within three minutes
of the sending of the first signals, the "shore" is told
to "stand by," and the cable is turned over to the
jointer for the joint between the sea and the new
cable in the ship's tanks.

From the time the ship is due to arrive on the
"grounds," a continuous watch for signals is kept at
the cable office on shore, and tests are made daily to
show whether the ship has cut off cable in grappling,
or whether further breaks or faults have arisen. When
the cable is sawed through on arriving at the surface,
there is usually a "kick" of the moving element of the
galvanometer, or "speaking-mirror," so that excite-
ment is running high when the ship "speaks" and
breaks the monotony of a vigil of many weeks.
Splicing the Cable a Delicate Job
When the ends of the cable are being prepared for
the joint, the armor wires are laid back alxmt thirty
feet, and so trimmed that when the joint is completed
and the armor wires are in place to protect the insu-
lated conductor the armor wires of the old cables will
extend varying distances, up to thirty feet, along the
new cable, and vice versa.
The conductor of the old cable is soldered to the
conductor of the new cable and the joint is carefully
insulated with gutta percha. The gutta pcrcha is
applied in thin sheets and tooled with a hot iron, and
worked with the fingers to exclude air. At a depth
of three miles, the pressure on the joint is nearly four
tons per square inch, and air bubbles in it are sure to
cause ruptures in the insulation. The insulated joint
is served with a layer of tape or loose-spun threads,
then with a layer of brass tape (to exclude the destruct-
ful teredo), and finally with jute or Russian hemp
before the sheathing wires are laid in place.
The spice completed, paying out is begun. The new
cable being paid out from the ship's tanks is wrapped
around a paying-out drum about six feet in diameter
fitted with powerful brakes to control the speed of pay-
ing-out. Fifteen or twenty miles of new cable may
be paid out at one operation, and then the cable is cut
and fastened to a huge cable buoy and slipped over-
board to await the successful outcome of grappling
and paying-out operations on the other side of the
break. Then it will be hauled on board, connected to
the other length of new cable being paid out, and
dropped to the bottom of the Atlantic to lie undis-
turbed for perhaps a hundred years.
Immediately after the joint has been insulated, the
electrical engineer communicates with the shore, and
then, with the shore end of the cable "free," he begins
an insulation test which is continued until the joint
and several miles of new cable have been paid out.
Any weakening of the joint or kinking or stretching
of the cable would be detected at once.
Cablegrams may now be exchanged with the shore
and the engineer may exchange greetings with col-
leagues in the cable station, but the conversation is
interrupted at frequent intervals for insulation tests.
The shore and the ship may collaborate in the
making of D. K. and C. R. tests, for the conditions at
the shore end of the cable may be more favorable for
high accuracy in testing than on board ship, and vice
versa. The data obtained from these tests may be of
the utmost importance in the localization of future
breaks and faults. The resistance of the conductor
varies with its temperature, and the tests of the
immersed cable, besides giving the resistance of the
cable as it lies on the bottom, also gives, by calcula-
tion, the mean bottom temperature. At a depth of
three miles, the temperature is about 350 F.
Patience Required in Testing the New Cable
The suspended elements of the galvanometers used
in testing are so weighted that they are not disturbed
by the rolling and pitching of the ship, but, unfortu-

Th&gt;5 Deck or .v Cable Ship
natelv, there are many things more distressing than
rolling and pitching, and entirely beyond control. The
cable is the seat of many local voltages and currents
caused, in part, by the swinging of the cable in the
tank through the earth's magnetic field as the ship
rolls; by uneven temperature distribution on the bot-
tom of the ocean; by the wobbling of the earth on its
axis; by variations in the earth's field, caused by "sun-
spots"; by stray currents and their attendant magnetic
fields in the vicinity of cable landings; and by galvanic
action at faults in the insulation of the cable.
The experienced engineer can appraise the influence
of these disturbances in the results of his tests, but he

Chairman Colloid Committee of the National Research Council
HP HERE is nothing mysterious about colloids. They
are not new substances, but merely ordinary sub-
stances with particles of special dimensions, ranging
from approximately one to one hundred millionths of
a millimeter. Such particles are a little larger than
the largest molecules and yet just too small to be seen
with definite diameter by the microscope.
Colloidal particles, then, are simply aggregates of a
few hundred (more or less) molecules. With a some-
what greater degree of dispersion, colloidal suspensions
become true solutions. On the other hand, when these
colloidal units or aggregates coalesce into still larger
aggregates they may be precipitated from suspension.
Unless such coagulated material becomes distinctly
crystalline on standing, we are in the habit of calling
it colloidal, as in the case of cheese, for example.
From the theoretical standpoint, the chemist is inter-
ested in such topics as the preparation of colloids, their
electric charge, coagulation, peptization, protective
action, dialysis and diffusion, gel structure, surface
tension, emulsions, viscosity, adsorption of gases,
adsorption from solution, and many others.
Used in All Branches of Science
All the sciences, even astronomy dealing with the
colloidal dust of comets' tails, are dependent upon col-
loid chemistry for their full development. Physics
with its surface energy problems, geology with diffu-
sion through gelatinous silicic acid and fine powders,
biology with hydrated plant and animal tissues, medi-
cine with the study of hydration and diffusion in body
tissues and peptization by digestive juices, engineering
with countless colloid problems to solve—all eagerly
watch the rapid growth of the young science of colloid
chemistry.
The applications to the industries are almost univer-
sal, although all manufacturers are not yet familiar
with this fact. When research chemists demonstrate
convincingly to their employers the basic connection
between colloid chemistry and industry, our manufac-
turers will finally come to a proper appreciation of the
financial importance of this growing science.
Colloid chemistry is closely related to the problems
of lubrication, agriculture, de-watering oils, purifying
clays, catching offensive or wasted fumes, drying peat,
de-inking old newspapers, concentrating ores, tanning,
baking, cooking, washing, dyeing, road-making, pho-
tography, water purification, sewage disposal; and one
should know a good deal about colloid chemistry if he
is to manufacture rubber goods, glass, porcelain, enam-
els, cements, alloys, fungicides and insecticides, dairy
products, any cellulose ester materials, colloidal fuel,
gelatine, glues, gas masks, adsorbent gels, paints, var-
nishes, soap, inks, oils, pencils, and crayons.
Theory and practice must go hand in hand. For
example, wetting power, the ability of a liquid to wet
a solid, is a property made use of in many technical
processes and one may blunder along in the application
without adequate theory as a foundation. Nuttall (/.
Soc. Client. Ind. 39, 67-73, 1920) discusses this sub-
ject very clearly. For a liquid to spread easily in a
thin film on a solid, the liquid must have a low surface
tension, a low interfacial tension, and perhaps a high
surface viscosity. Solutions of alkali soaps, with their
low surface tension, have high wetting powers. But a
solution of saponin with a comparatively high surface
tension has excellent wetting powers due to its high
surface viscosity. A one per cent solution of saponin
wets a sheet of paraffin wax, although a five per cent
solution of soap does not.
Substances that lower surface tension concentrate at
surfaces or interfaces, sometimes in a film with the
properties of a plastic solid, as in the case of saponin.
These films tend to prevent mixture and running
together to form drops.
Thus, saponin is a good emulsifying agent, as is an
alkali soap, but for a different reason. The plastic
film formed at the oil-water interface interferes with
the coalescence of drops. In milk the globules of fat
are surrounded by a tenacious coating of adsorbed
protein.
Foaming, usually, but not always, parallels high wet-
ting power. Saponin foams are merely plastic films
resembling the "armor-plated" flotation froths.
In flotation of ores we depend upon the fact that a
little added oil wets the small particles of the valuable
metallic sulfide better than does water, while the reverse
is true for the particles of "gangue" or waste rock.
Thus, when finely ground ore is beaten with water
carrying a very little of some special oil, the films of
oil in the froth wet and float the copper sulfide (or
other valuable sulfide). The froth is stabilized and
stiffened by presence of this plastic film of sulfide par-
ticles. Removal of the froth gives a concentrate far
richer than the original ore. Of course, the gangue,
being preferentially wet by water, sinks to the bottom
of the tank. Quartz particles may be wetted even more
readily by water if a little acid or base be added. This
may be due to adsorption of hydrogen ion or of
hydroxy 1 ion. Since 60,000,000 tons of low grade ores
are "floated" annually, it is evident that the topic of

"preferential wetting" is worthy of study. Now it is
proposed that fine particles of coal be separated from
ash, or rock waste, by the use of a solution wetting the
two materials in different degree.
Emulsions and Their Formation
Emulsions are dispersions of one liquid in another
and are simply made by suitable mechanical agitation
of the two liquids. However, the tendency of the two
liquids to form two drops or layers, thus presenting
the minimum of surface, is so great that to prevent
coalescence of minute drops a third substance called
an "emulsifying agent" must be present. As a rule,
the emulsifying agent is colloidally dispersed in one
of the liquids; for example, an alkali soap in water.
Such alkali soaps aid emulsification by lowering the
surface tension of the water as well as by forming
concentration films around the oil globules. Saponin,
on the other hand, is a good emulsifying agent, in spite
of the comparatively high surface tension of its aque-
ous solutions, because it concentrates at the oil-water
interface to form a plastic film.
With alkaline earth soaps the oil is not dispersed in
drops in water (the usual type of emulsions), but
water is dispersed in drops throughout the oil (the
unusual type, a water-in-oil emulsion). This is because
alkaline earth soaps are more soluble in oil than in
water. A rule applicable here is that if the emulsifying
agent is more readily peptized by liquid A than by
liquid B it will be B that is dispersed in drops. This
is even true in the case of insoluble fine powders which
are more readily wet by A than by B.
Industry needs emulsions and makes them, but indus-
try is also concerned with breaking certain annoying
emulsions. To attack such a problem, one must first
learn what the emulsifying agent is. It may be a soap,
a glue, a gum, a fine-grained sludge, or a sulfonated
oil. In any event, it must be removed or converted
into some other substance. Addition of acid to a soap
is effective because this liberates the fatty acid, a poor
emulsifying agent. A dehydrating agent may ruin the
effectiveness of a highly hydrated emulsifying agent.
Since oil particles carry a negative charge of electricity,
they may coalesce if this charge is neutralized by ions
of high positive charge, such as Al-\—|—|- or Fe-|—|—(-.
Also, if the droplet charge is almost neutralized by
addition of a suitable salt, the emulsion may become
so unstable that filtration through proper material will
completely separate oil from water.
Lubricating greases are emulsions of 3-5 per cent
water in a soap-oil system. The soap, usually a cal-
cium soap, although aluminum soaps are also in use,
is dissolved in the hot oil, a heavy petroleum fraction.
The mixture is stirred while cooling and the water
added below 100°. Separation of oil from soap on
long standing is checked by the presence of water drop-
lets. It is probable that some alkali soap is added to
increase the viscosity of the water droplets. Cheaper
greases are made by the use of soaps of the rosin acids.
Wetting Power Must Be Considered
Nuttall, in his fine paper already referred to, points
out that a disinfectant must wet the surfaces it is
intended to disinfect. Chick and Martin (7. Hygictic,
8, 698-703) believe that with coal tar disinfectants the
bacteria are adsorbed on the emulsified particles of the
tar acid, thus being brought into contact with the disin-
fectant in a most concentrated form. Sprays must wet
green leaves. "By incorporating an oil emulsion with
the dip, and thus ensuring high wetting power, Cooper
showed that it was possible materially to reduce the
sodium arsenite content of the dip and yet ensure the
destruction of the tick without injury to the cattle.
This application alone of wetting power has been
instrumental in clearing large tracts of tick-infested
country in various parts of the world."
Wetting power has been discussed here in some
detail as an illustration of what any chapter in colloid
chemistry may lead to if applied as carefully. Space
lacks for an adequate discussion of the enormously
important topic of adsorption.
Adsorption of toxic gases by cocoanut charcoal is
familiar to all after the experiences of the Great War.
Yet the application of the principles of gas adsorption
by activated carbon, silica gel, etc., is now a peace-time
matter of great commercial importance. Silicic acid,
formed as a gel, washed and dried to a content of 18
per cent or less, is a glassy material shot through with
innumerable capillary pores of diameter not much
greater than that of molecules. In these capillary pores
gases are brought well within the range of molecular
attractive forces, and so are held or "adsorbed." This
adsorption is preferential for various gases, but it may
be mentioned that such a "gel" is a powerful dryer, that
it removes gasoline from casing-head gas, and that it
removes obnoxious sulfur compounds from crude
petroleum, thus suggesting the possibility of dispensing
with the costly sulfuric acid treatment in refining
petroleum.
The power of silica gel to adsorb sulfur dioxide and
the oxides of nitrogen suggests its use in connection
with the Gay-Lussac tower of a sulfuric acid plant.
The use of fuller's earth in oil refining is an appli-
cation of adsorption, as is the use of bone char in
decolorizing the syrups in sugar refining.
The physical condition of the soil, its colloid con-
tent, have everything to do with its power to retain
water, to hold and adsorb the fertilizing salts so vital
to plant growth.
Good Lubricating Film Important
According to W. B. Hardy, a good lubricating film
must be powerfully adsorbed by the bearing surfaces.
Otherwise the film will tear away in spots and seizure

of the metal surfaces may result. It is an interesting
fact that Southcombe and Wells found the addition
of one per cent of the free fatty acids of rape oil, for
example, to a petroleum lubricant added as much to
the effective lubrication as addition of more than ten
per cent of neutral rape oil itself. This must mean a
superior lowering of the interfacial tension between
oil and metal. Of course, a very low interfacial ten-
sion is necessary to film formation and penetration to
all parts of the lubricated surfaces.
Many wheats (as California wheat, for example)
yield weak gluten flours. Such gluten in the bread
dough does not stretch well enough for a good loaf and
admixture with a strong gluten flour is necessary. The
protein of corn, rye, and other grains is "weak" in the
sense that it does not permit the manufacture of a sat-
isfactory light, porous loaf. The colloid chemist who
can so change the physical condition of corn, rye, or
oat protein that it will stretch like the best wheat gluten
will add untold wealth to the world and have much to
do with checking famines.
The de-inking of old newspapers is a conservation
measure of first importance. S. D. Wells reports that
this may now be done successfully and the pulp worked
over into paper. It is easy to loosen the carbon black
by dissolving the varnish with alkali, but, unfortu-
nately, the paper fibers enmesh the loosened carbon.
However, by adding to the wet pulp some Wyoming
bentonite, a highly colloidal "transported, volcanic
ash," the carbon will be adsorbed by the clay rather
than by the paper. This bentonite is so finely divided
that a water suspension of it passes through a filter
paper, even though it carry the carbon with it. Over
7,000 tons of newspapers are printed daily.
Pulverized Coal
Sheppard and Bates have invented a process for
peptizing (subdividing colloidal size of particle) pow-
dered coal in fuel oil. The coal, even the worst grades,
is pulverized until 95 per cent will go through a 100-
mesh sieve and 85 per cent through a 200-mesh sieve.
Stirred with fuel oil carrying less than one per cent of
the peptizing agent, a remarkably stable liquid suspen-
sion is obtained. As much as 40 per cent of it may be
coal and yet it is so fluid that it can be sprayed like
fuel oil and burned under boilers. This "colloidal fuel"
would be excellent for ships, partly because the fire
hazard is less than that of oil. As the fuel is heavier
than water, a sprayed liquid is so good that the lowest
grade coals, even lignite, can he utilized.
All glues arc hydrated colloids, hence when dry they
tend to take up water from moist air and thus weaken.
To so change these glues that they will not rehydrate
after drying and yet will retain their adhesive power
is a problem of vast importance. Large timhers are
becoming scarcer and we are being forced to the use
of timbers built up from smaller pieces. Present-day
glues greatly limit the period of usefulness of glued
woods. They weaken too soon.
Metals and alloys at a certain stage of their exist-
ence are in a colloidal state, and although this stage
may be brief, a portion of the metal or alloy tends to
remain in the colloidal state and exert a powerful influ-
ence upon the physical properties of the final solid
mass. (Alexander.)
These few applications of colloid chemistry may
serve as an incentive to further reading. For such
reading I urge the purchase (at a small price, fortu-
nately) of the "First, Second, and Third Reports on
Colloid Chemistry and its General and Industrial
Applications." These are issued by the British Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science. A fourth
report is in press and a fifth in preparation.

may meet with disturbances so violent that many hours
of patient testing are entirely fruitless.
Deep-sea cable is comparatively light and easy to
handle, and paying-out speeds of as high as ten miles
per hour may be attained in fine weather when many
miles of cable have to be laid in one operation and
from large and roomy tanks.
The specific gravity of a particular Atlantic cable
is 2.3, and its weight in water is only 2,500 pounds pre
mile. The conductor of this cable weighs 650 pounds
per mile, the insulating covering weighs 400 pounds
per mile, and the core is protected by 18 steel wires
of i4 S. W. G., each wire being covered with com-
pound and tape. The over-all diameter of the cable
is one inch.
When a deep-sea cable is being laid at a uniform
speed, it does not hang as a catenary, but glides in a
straight line to the bottom, and its point of contact
with the bottom is about twenty miles astern when
the depth is three miles. There is considerable fric-
tional resistance to the gliding cable, so it must of
necessity be kept taut by the brakes on the paying-out
drum, and as much as 100 II. P. must be absorbed
by the brakes when the indicated strain is about a ton.
The cable is laid with from ten to twenty per cent
slack so that it may follow the contour of the bottom;
and there have been very few cases of cable failure
due to the cable having been laid so tight that it was
in suspension from hill-top to hill-top.
When the depth is less than five hundred fathoms,
the size and number of the wires forming the protect-
ing sheathing are increased, and in the vicinity of land-
ing places and where the cable is liable to damage by
icebergs settling on them the armor may be increased
so greatly that the weight of the cable per mile becomes
as high as sixty tons.

N connection with the refining of copper, which
is treated in Professor Miller's recent article in
The Technic, certain facts pertaining to the supply
and production of copper from the mine may serve to
supplement the subject and to explain the reason for
the rather unusual conditions in the copper industry
at the present time. Table I, taken from the United
States Government Reports, gives the annual produc-
tion of copper for the thirteen largest copper-producing
states for the critical years 1918, 1919, 1920, and Table
II the total output for each year since 1915.
It will be observed that four states stand out con-
sistently above all others in production, and of these
four Michigan ranks third. For the most part, the
ore bodies in Arizona, Montana, and Michigan are at
depths which require underground working and hoist-
ing operations. The Michigan district is notably one
of deep shafts and high grade ore. A hoist has recently
been installed in this district having a rope capacity of
8,600 feet vertical depth.

In Arizona, which ranks first in production, the ores
are widely scattered and are being worked at depths
mostly between 300 and 1,000 feet, though some shafts
are over 2,000 feet deep.
The Butte, Montana, district is one of the largest
single producers. Here the ore is being mined at all
depths up to 3,500 feet.
At Bingham Canon, Utah, a small mountain of low
grade copper ore is being worked by the use of steam
shovels. First, a capping of earth 30 to 50 feet deep
is removed and hauled to adjacent valleys. The ore
is then worked by steps or ledges 50 to 70 feet wide
and about the same height. Holes for blasting are
drilled several feet from the edge and after blasting the
loosened ore falls to the ledge below, where it is picked
up by steam shovels, dumped into ore cars and hauled
to the nearest smelter, several miles distant. Only by
handling enormous quantities of ore has this company
been able to compete with other districts. In this same
vicinity there is a considerable amount of underground
mining.

Because of the fact that the largest single item of
cost in the production of copper is the mining of it,
companies have given a great deal of attention to the
economical operation of the power equipment, and in
all these districts will be found the highest development
of mining methods and hoisting operations. The actual
producing of ore very frequently will require all of
the following operations or installation, viz., under-
ground work, including mine timbering, rock drilling,
development work, surveying, tramming, pumping,
lighting, and ventilation; surface equipment, including
boilers, air compressors, hoists, engine generator sets,
and shops.
In actual operations many difficulties are encoun-
tered. Keeping the workings free of water is often a
very serious problem and increases the difficulty as
well as the cost of operation. In many metal mining
districts fuel is a scarce and expensive item. As mines
become developed the distance of tramming and hoist-
ing of ore becomes greater and more expensive. The
operation of a large mine is no small task.
Statistics show that the combined costs of mining
and reduction of ore are nearly 80 per cent of the total
cost of production, the refining is about 6l/i per cent,
and the selling expense is almost nothing. The last is
explained by the fact that the demand under normal
condition is greater than the supply.
The average annual production for the period i,;i5
to 1920 was 1,600,000.000 pounds. The apparent nor-
mal annual demand for this same period would be
approximately 1,400,000,000 pounds. For the six years,
therefore, there is an apparent over-production of
(2

1,200,000,000 pounds, or nearly one total year's supply.
In 1914 and 1915 the price per pound of copper,
which had been established by agreement among pro-
ducers, consumers, and mine workers, was 12 to 14
cents per pound. During the war period the cost of
production rose so much more rapidly than the price
of copper that many companies operated with a direct
loss on account of contracts already made. The fixed
price of 23.5 cents by the Government in 1917 and of
26 cents in 1918 came too late to stabilize the industry.
The following list of manufacturers are among the
largest purchasers of copper, and this will give to the
reader an idea of where our enormous production of
copper is used:

Scoville Manufacturing Company 96,000,000
Roebling Sons Company 72,000,000
Standard Underground Cable Company 72,000,000
Other influences also must be taken into account.
Copper ore very often contains lead, zinc, silver, and
frequently gold. The market price of lead and zinc
reached a low point in 1920 and 1921. Silver was on
the decline and gold could not be profitably mined.
It is interesting to learn who are the ultimate con-
sumers of copper, and Table IV, by C. F. Kelly, in
Mining and Metallurgy, gives the estimated consump-
tion by industries for the year 1920:

Furthermore, the metal industries are influenced by
each other. The production of iron ore in 1921 was
25,000,000 tons below normal, a decrease of alx&gt;ut 40
per cent. Even aluminum, the normal annual produc-

tion of which is less than 10 per cent that of copper,
fell off considerably during 1921 and reached a low
price of 20 cents in December of that year.
The United States Geological Survey supplies the
following estimate of the refined copper in stock on
the first day of each year:
Year Pounds
1917 128,000,000
1918 114,000,000
1919 180,000,000
Year Pounds
1920 631,000,000
1921 659,000,000
1922 496,000,000
It will be observed that the over-production of 1917,
1918, and 1919 began to be seriously felt in 1920.
The demand for copper in those years was only appar-
ent and the over-production caused a setback in the
whole industry.
Copper mining has been for many years a stable
industry. Some have advocated that copper interests
launch a publicity campaign for a more extensive use
of copper in cooking utensils and the like. Such a
campaign has never been needed, for the reason that
the normal demand has always exceeded the normal
supply at the scale of prices maintained. The United
States consumes her own production of copper, export-
ing only in finished articles. Foreign conditions have
reduced the export demand in the last few years.
It is inconceivable, therefore, how a publicity cam-
paign could in any large measure affect the demand
for copper. Certainly it could have little if any effect
in overcoming the apparent over-production of 200,-
000,000 pounds per year for six years, an item nearly
twice greater than the total annual production of
aluminum. It would take a great deal of time to bring
about a more extensive use of copper in the form of
household utensils, and then it is doubtful if the dis-
criminating American housewife could be persuaded
to purchase a copper utensil merely on the basis of its
longer useful life than utensils made of other materials.
It would take a very successful salesman indeed to
compete in sales with the aluminum and granite wares
on our market. An aluminum dish weighs less than
one-third that of copper for the same capacity, is much
easier to clean, costs less, wears well, and is adapted
to all kinds of foods. Copper is not. Porcelain and
granite wares are inexpensive, easily cleaned, and gen-
erally adaptable to all foods. Special materials such
as Pyrex, with certain highly desirable qualities, have
filled a definite place in the household. It would seem
that copper would have little or no place today in the
realm of household utensils with the American house-
wife, except in the form in which it is now found.
Even if the demand were increased it could in no wise
affect our enormous normal output.
It would appear, therefore, in view of the many
influences that enter into the production and use of
copper, that this industry will recover as general indus-
trial and financial conditions become normal.

(^nPHE transit will be carried on the left shoul-
der. In saluting, turn the head toward the
officer and slap the tripod smartly with the palm of
the right hand." This detail of ceremonial never
appeared in drill books or daily orders, but was prac-
ticed by light-hearted Canadian transitmen on sober
British officers just to see what they would do. Most
of them, perhaps thereby admitting unconsciously that
modern wars are won by engineering, took and returned
the compliment in soldierly fashion.
Of course the engineers have always been there to
take their share of dirt ever since Hannibal's sappers
poured vinegar upon the hot rocks in the passes of
the Alps. But it was only in the recent war that the
railroader had a chance to win his spurs. In 1916 the
Allies, with France slightly in the lead as usual, decided
that they needed lots of light railways promptly. So
they got from Creusot miles of "Decauville" track—
light rails bolted to steel ties, 60 cm. gauge—from Bald-
win's, hundreds of dinky locomotives and twelve-ton
cars, and from everywhere, but mainly from this con-
tinent, fifteen battalions of men who had had expe-
rience in construction or in operation. The writer of
these fragments, a member of the seventh such bat-
talion from its organization till it was demobbed, joined
the colors early in 1917 at a time when men were
being given box-car numbers of seven figures, and
consequently cannot honestly claim for his exploits
any jot of novelty.
One the day we landed in Le Havre, gas-masks were
issued and we put them on to the tune of "One, two,
three, four, five, you're dead." Another hint that war
is dirty business came with the identfiication discs:
"Never take these off; the green one is to be returned
to Records and the red one is to be buried with the
body." We marched down to entrain on Palm Sun-
day; though all the French children were carrying
sprigs of green, my mate, perhaps as devout a Cath-
olic as any of them, could not stick one in his cap
because "you're in the army now." Rumor, which had
been active on the boat and had destined us for all the
ports in succession from Suez to Archangel, again
asserted itself. There were men with us who had
been in the battle of the Somme, and as we passed
St. Pol and Hazebrouck rumor was replaced by cer-
tainty. We were headed for "Wipers" and the sec-
ond British army.
We began construction at once and had three months
in which to learn the smell of powder before the suc-
cessful push which put Fritz off the Messines ridge.
Is it significant of the thoroughness with which the
army does some things that the death of army mule
number 69 was duly recorded in orders, while our first
casualty, a Douglas of Saskatoon, was not? We
passed rapidly through the stage of learning that
there's an interesting piece of brass in every fresh
shell-hole, and much lesi rapidly through that of
bringing in German trench helmets, sewing them up
in burlap, and hoping to get them passed by the cen-
sor. A pair of baby sabots never got through because
an enemy agent would have correctly inferred from
them that we were encamped at G 12 c 72 and that
Colonel Larry Martin of Renfrew had recruited us in
three weeks and had brought us over while we were
still learning "Right turn by numbers, ONE!"
Our survey party had, in addition to American
instruments of familiar pattern, a Cook transit accu-
rate enough for any kind of geodetic hair-splitting,
but we found small use for that or for seven-place
tables in a country whose major landmarks and minor
topography were subject to change without notice.
Because the steel was so made at the mills, we were
permitted to use only two kinds of curve: radii, 100
metres and 50 metres. The latter, when translated,
means a 35-degree curve, and you will not be surprised
to learn that we were frequently obliged to drop every-
thing else and lift a "U boat" back on the rails. This
"U boat" was a light gasoline engine much loved by
the artillerymen because it never sent up a white cloud
of steam to attract the attention (stress that word
attention) of enemy observers. Field engineering was
simplified in another direction: we were never required
to compute yardage and our contractors, or what cor-
responded to them, never hollered for "overbreak."
When not out on line, we improved our French,
accomplishing such tours de force as "Dayzoof, mad-
ame"; we played Crown and Anchor, a sudden-death
game of skill comparable with the galloping bones of
the doughboy; we shined our brass and sang "Peace,
perfect peace," on church parade. Steady; we were
not quite plaster saints; on other parades (delousing,
for instance) we sang some Gitz Rice classics that
have never become endemic this side of Armentieres.
Heard a "V" speaker make the keen remark: "You've
all been to that place back of Poperinghe where they
clean men's blankets, but there's not a place in all
France where they can delouse men's minds."

London, eighty miles away, heard the explosion that
wrecked Hill 60, but no one has told me the exact time
of zero hour, and though only five miles away, I slept
through the racket until the bugler did his worst. All
that busy day our trains did nothing but bring out
wounded, and rough as was the ballasting, some poor
fellows were rushed down in time to save their lives.
We had guessed that zero hour was near because the
roads were crowded with Red Cross ambulances, fresh
cages had been made for prisoners, and, worse token,
a long, wide, shallow trench had been dug back of
Brandhoek field hospital.
On the following days we laid lines over the brick-
dust that li'as St. Eloi, scrambled up over the Damm-
strass, and because our 18-pounders were behind us
firing flat trajectory, promptly scrambled down again
Secure in the confidence that "Douggie" Haig could
carry out his plans, we prepared for the drive on
Zonnebeke, seven miles nearer Berlin. The survey
party was taken back to Busseboom and shown our
line neatly laid down in tennis tape on a monster relief
map. We broke camp on the morning of July 31 in
order to take up the new position assigned to us on
ground to be cleared east of Ypres. Reference to the
communiques will show that Heinie was not ready to
retreat and that the drive petered out after the first
six hours. (Beg pardon; they seldom got that close
to the truth; when nothing pleasant could be said they
repeated the current fiction, "We maintain our suprem-
acy in the air.") Anyhow, there we were, cluttering
up with our household goods roads badly needed by
other services; the Colonel was up on the carpet for it,
but still we claim the distinction that no other battalion
in France ever went over the top with all its quarter's
stores, including the soup-kitchen and the piano from
the sergeants' mess.
A flesh wound brought a trip to hospital near Bou-
logne. To sleep in clean sheets is splendid, but why
must sister come around at four in the morning with
her "Open your mouth"? The battle for the Pilkem
ridges was in progress; so, to make room for some-
one who needed the bed more than I did, I was hurried
through convalescent camp and base back to the bat-
talion. Drives across those fields of pasty clay were
retarded by the fall rains and ended with Passcheu-
daele, a bright spot in Canada's history for which she
paid 12,000 lives.
The following lines are eloquent of the spirit in
which we carried on with location and construction.
The first one means Assistant Director of Light Rail-
ways:
The A. Dee. Ell. Ah.
Said, "We'll start a line heah"
(With a sweep of his pencil)
"We'll end it out theah."
The line is run in
And the profile is made,
But you can't climb that hill
On a one-per-cent grade.
Hallelujah! go revise it;
Hallelujah! get the men;
Beat it out there in the morning
And revise it again.
God knows it is tough
When the ground is so rough;
We've revised it nine times—
Surely that is enough.
Hallelujah! don't grumble;
Hallelujah! don't complain;
Just screw up your courage,
And revise it again.
If the stakes all take root
And produce bud and shoot.
This poor land will have forests
And orchards to boot.
Hallelujah! carry on;
Hallelujah! get it done.
When the last stake is driven
The war will be won.
Shortly after Christmas we were taken out for what
the army regards as a rest. Rifles were issued; we
were taught to juggle them and to clean them, and
might have been taught to shoot if a new engineering
major had not arrived. The first had been an engineer
in a department store in Ottawa. You know the pneu-
matic arrangement some stores have: Pff! here's your
change. Well, he conceived the bright idea that shells
could be driven through tubes up to the front line by
compressed air. lie went oil to convince the War
Office and may have died in the attempt.
His successor was from New Jersey, knew his job
from o to 00, and liked it better than the military game.
As a result, the survey section was taken away on a
long location project in a part of France khaki-infested
it is true, but free from shell-holes, gas-alarms, night-
raids, and other "Schrecklichkeit." We had our own
three-ton lorry to move camp, to take us to work, and
to rustle food and firewood, and in fact we carried on
just as such a party would in this country. For three
months we averaged seventy stations a day and turned
in pretty plans and profiles. We chopped our way
through hedges and orchards, and, perhaps because of
the uniform, were tolerated by the peasants. Our line
lay through the wallowing ground of the tanks and

T EGISLATION is a very powerful factor in the
development of any public utility, and the facts
upon which it is based should be ascertained with the
greatest care. The present controversies over city
motorbus operation and taxation of fuels and vehicles
recalls the fact that even in the
earlier part of the nineteenth cen-
tury steam motor coaches were
operating in and out from London.
They were capable of speeds up to
thirty miles per hour and carried
from ten to thirty passengers at an
average fuel cost of eight cents per
mile. Nevertheless, in the middle
of the same century legislation was
enacted which reserved the use of
the highways to horse-drawn vehi-
cles and effectually stifled an indus-
try well on the road to success.
In railway transportation the
rolling stock and roadbed is owned
by one company and will be financed
from the same funds. Motor trans-
port presents a peculiar situation, in
that the rolling stock is owned,
operated, and maintained by many
individuals, companies, and corpo-
rations, while the roadbed is con-
structed and maintained by the
state. Improved highways and
good maintenance require huge
expenditures by the state, but will
reduce the operating costs and
depreciation of the vehicles. This
presents a very real economic prob-
lem whose correct solution will
reduce the total cost of transporta-
tion to a minimum and properly
apportion that cost among all who
are benefited by the increased trans-
portation facilities.
One phase of the problem is the
determination of the most econom-
ical grades in highway construction.
The highway engineer must know how great an expen-
diture is justified in reducing certain grades or in
choosing locations involving different grades and just
what limitations grade will impose on certain types of
traffic. In other words, he must balance the operating
cost to the traffic against the construction and mainte-
nance cost to the state in such a way that the total
cost of transportation is a minimum.
On the latter cost considerable data is available, but
on the performance of trucks on various grades com-
paratively little reliable information may be found.

The operating costs of a truck would be affected by
steep grades in the following items:
1. Loss of time (affecting all fixed charges).
2. Increased depreciation.
3. Increased fuel cost.
4. Increased tire cost.

5. Increased cost of repairs.
6. Increased cost of oils and greases.
Under certain conditions, an economy may be
affected by the use of one or more trailers, and we
must determine the excess power of the truck available
for drawing the trailers and just what grades will limit
the use of one or two trailers of given weights.
At the instigation of the State Highway Commis-
sioner active steps were taken in the year 1920-21 to
secure data on the above problem. Four trucks were
1. Engine (down to clutch).
2. Transmission system (clutch to rear axle).
3. Running gear (tires, wheels and their bearings).
The engines were then removed from the trucks and
a complete power and fuel consumption test made,
including the calibration of torque against manifold
depression. After the engine was replaced in the truck,
it was mounted between two electric dynamometers,
one of which was driven by each axle. The power
input to the transmission system was indicated by the

Chart 2
sent from the equipment of the Michigan State High-
way Department and work was begun at once by the
class in Advanced Testing and Automobile Research,
under the active direction of V. R. Burton and the
author.
A preliminary survey of the problem showed that it
would be most profitable to attack a small section of it
and solve it completely and accurately. So only one
type and size of vehicle was considered and its per-
formance studied when operating at one speed over
two road surfaces and grades varying from level to
eight per cent. However, to give a complete check on
the performance data, four vehicles of the same make,
size, and model were used.
In order to analyze the performance of a truck, it
may be conveniently divided into three groups of
mechanisms:
manifold depression and engine speed and the output
measured by the dynamometers. Thus the efficiency
of the transmission efficiency of the transmission sys-
tem was determined for different speeds and power
outputs. The rolling resistance of the running gear
was next determined by towing the trucks (with the
rear axle shafts removed) over two routes including
two kinds of surfaces and a series of grades whose
profiles had been accurately surveyed.
From data obtained from the above tests may be
computed the expected fuel mileage for the trucks in
terms of mlies per gallon. This computed mileage was
then checked by actual fuel measurement on each truck
operating over the above mentioned course. The road
test results varied considerably owing to varying con-
ditions of operation, the average results checking the
computed mileage very nicely.

Among the interesting developments of the investi-
gation was a draw-bar pull dynamometer of the
hydraulic type built to measure the fluctuating force
required to pull a vehicle over even the most uniform
of road surfaces. It was constructed from a cylinder
and piston of a Liberty aeroplane engine, a recording
gauge, and the necessary pipe connections for this
machine. In operation, the piston was connected
through a piston rod and chain to the towing truck,
while the cylinder was secured to the truck whose roll-
ing resistance was determined.
Steam cylinder oil was com-
pressed between piston and cylin-
der by the pull and the pressure
transmitted to a recording pres-
sure gauge through flexible metal
tubing.
The more important results of
the tests on the engine are shown
in chart 1.
The fuel consumption of the
vehicle on various grades and
surfaces is shown in chart 2.
Chart 3 gives a clear idea of
where the power losses occur
and their magnitude on various
grades with truck operating in
third gear.
A study of the results ob-
tained brings out the following
essential conclusions:
It is believed that the experi-
ment has shown that it is pos-
sible by measuring the engine
and transmission system per-
formance in the laboratory and
then measuring the rolling re-
sistance in the field, to accurately
determine the truck perform-
ance on grades. The close agree-
ment of the computed and ob-
served values would seem to
show that it is possible.
For surmounting a fixed rise
in a given distance, the use of a
grade at which a truck operates most efficiently, for
the longest distance possible, will give a minimum fuel
consumption. This grade for a gravel surface is a
little over two per cent and for a concrete surface is a
little under three per cent for the trucks used in the
experiment.
The fuel consumption on plus grades is nearly pro-
portional to an increase in rate of grade from about
two per cent up, but the operation of a truck on the
level requires a greater amount proportionally than the
ratio on grades greater than two per cent.
The use of brakes on minus grades materially lessens
the fuel consumption, and where safe descent is assured
should always be used. Grades with safe alignment
and with the maximum rates commonly used in this
section need not be descended in gear with brakes in
good order.
Where it is considered that trailers are to become a
large factor in transportation in the near future, a
maximum ruling grade of about three per cent should

Chart 3
be adhered to. This will reduce the speed of the trac-
tor vehicle about 30 per cent.
Where single unit vehicles only need be considered,
the maximum ruling grade should be limited to 4j4
per cent, unless comparatively short lengths arc used,
if any heavy volume of truck traffic is expected.
.Surfacing with a hard-surfaced road is in effect
reducing the grade .78 per cent.
Further computations as to limiting lengths of
steeper grades which can be used by permitting speed
to drop can be easily made.

Law Examiner, B.S.(C.E.), '85
TN THE early spring of 1885 there appeared an al-
luring circular on the University bulletin an-
nouncing an examination of candidates for the posi-
tion of fourth assistant examiner in the Patent Office.
Not long after this the late Dean C. E. Greene, at an
''at home" given by himeslf and Mrs. Greene to the
senior engineers, expressed his opinion that the Patent
Office offered a fine opening to any young men who
wished to take advantage of its opportunities.
Accordingly, the examination in June found a
dozen or more of us on hand to brave its terrors, and
soon after we bade each other good-bye with the part-
ing words, "Meet you in Washington".
At that time about 350,000 patents had been grant-
ed since the beginning of the Patent Office, shortly
after the War of the Revolution. Now there are in
the neighborhood of 1,440,000. The number of foreign
patents has increased probably in the same proportion.
Any new patent is void if the subject matter claimed
therein can be found in any earlier patent, foreign or
domestic, and it is the business of the examining corps
of the Patent Office to see that void patents are not
granted. The above figures show that the field of
search has increased more than four-fold in the past
thirty-six years. The number of applications for
patents which are now made per year and which must
be examined has also increased at the rate of two and
one-half to one, so that the amount of work is now
more than twelve times as great as then.
There were then twenty-seven examining divisions
with one principal examiner and about four assistant
examiners in each. There are now forty-nine divisions
with one principal examiner and about eight assistant
examiners in each.
Added to all this the stationary salaries during the
war-time and afterward, and the tempting offers on
the outside deprived the office of many of its most
efficient examiners, the turnover in one year being as
high as twenty-five per cent.
Temporary appointments had to be made from men
who could not pass the usual examination, and who
of course as a rule did not compare with those whose
places they took, either in quantity or quality of work.
The situation finally culminated in an insistent
demand on the part of inventors and manufacturers
throughout the land for relief, which resulted at last
in a substantial increase in both office force and com-
pensation. The new salaries will be fair when pre-war
prices return, but as yet have not served, to prevent
many of our men leaving to accept more lucrative
positions.
What is to be the remedy for the ever increasing
disparity between work and workers? Congress will
grant an occasional increase in force, but never in
proportion to the increase in the work demanded of
them.
To Improve Methods and Efficiency
Probably the most immediate relief will be due to
the increasing efficiency of the men who are now com-
ing into the office, as the years add to their knowledge
and experience. A large number of them will be able
to double their output in time if they can be retained.
Better methods and increased conveniences will
doubtless contribute somewhat, for there can be pro-
gress in these as well as in all other lines of human
endeavor, and cooperation between the office on the
one hand, and inventors and their attorneys on the
other may lighten the work, but large results cannot
be expected from these expedients. The most prom-
ising field for improvement is the proper classification
of the patents which have been, and will be, granted,
so that the examiner may eliminate all but a relatively
small group of kindred patents when making a search,
and feel confident that he has seen every patent that
discloses the features claimed in the application before
him. Something has been done in this direction, but it
is safe to say that an ideal classification would enable
the office to turn out three times the present amount of
work. Such a classification will never be accomplished
within the office itself, unless accident or unexpected
circumstances produce the men and the leisure to do it.
Only the man with the brain of an Agassiz or a Lin-
naius could approach such a work, and neither the sal-
aries nor the mental tests used in selecting examiners
are likely to draw such men. How this large task will
be accomplished is difficult to predict, but it is cer-
tain that it will some day be done. Without it our pat-
ent system, one of the pillars of our national prosper-
ity, will fall because of its own weight. When the
performance of the task becomes imperative the
American people, if they remain true to the traditions
of the past, will find a way to do it. It is the opinion
of the writer that a commission, composed of such men
as Dean Cooley, Herbert Hoover, and Professor Cleve-
land, if given unlimited means with which to employ
experts, both in classification and in knowledge of the
(

arts and peculiar needs involved, could handle the
situation better than could be done in any other way.
As to the qualifications of an examiner in the Pat-
ent Office, a good examiner must be alert and eager
when on the lookout for an invention new to him, be-
lieving that the germ of most ideas will be found
somewhere if he only looks in the right place. lie
must have good judgment to keep him from searching
through thousands of patents where there is no possi-
bility of finding what he is looking for. He must have
imagination to conjure unexpected similarities, so that,
for example, he will look through the class entitled
"Jails" for a multiple lock that will simultaneously
fasten a plurality of dumping car bottoms. Again, he
must have the power of generalization, to keep him
from limiting his search to the specific thing shown
in the drawing before him, while the real invention is
broad or generic, covering devices similar in principle
to the one he is looking for, but differing radically
from it in appearance. Besides all this he should at
least be a graduate in engineering or chemistry, and the
more practical experience he can add to this the bet-
ter, but wide theoretical knowledge is preferable to
limited practical experience. Such an examiner is cer-
tain to rise rapidly in the office, or to resign for a hand-
some income after a few years of experience, that are
worth at least as much as an equal period of his col-
lege life.
Many worthy representatives of the University of
Michigan have come and gone and some are still in the
office, and almost without exception they have ranked
well among their fellows from almost all the higher
institutions of learning of the land. The first of them
known to the writer was Eugene Byrnes, M.A., '84,
who entered the office about the year 1885, and after
rapidly rising to the position of principal examiner in
the division of Metallurgy, resigned to practice patent
law. His remarkably successful and brilliant career
was cut short by his untimely death about ten years
ago. At present there are in the office Examiner of
Interference W. S. Ruckman, '86, Law Examiner
C. H. Lane, Principal Examiner Geo. R. Simpson, of
the Division of Railways, Railway Appliances and
Railway Signals, Principal Examiner Benson, of the
Division of Internal Combustion Engines, Principal
Examiner Hopkins, of the Division of Sanitary Engi-
neering, and Assistant Examiners Arthur W. Dew,
Aldie R. Green, Louis Ilugrefe, Jarvis C. Marble,
Otto W. Strachan, Charles II. Shamel, Orson L. Simp-
son and C. M. Tenny. Doubtless there are others whose
names do not occur to the writer at the present time.
Life in Washington
To the majority of examiners, life in Washington
is preferable to life in an industrial city, big or little.
Outside of a few circles whose exclusiveness is equally
as welcome to others as to themselves life is more
sane and intellectual than in most cities. There is more
real home life, and contact with men who stand high
in public and scientific stations is more common. Many
places of interest and entertainment are peculiar to
Washington, and in general picturesque environments
are more accessible than elsewhere. To be sure, there
are times when some wish they were anything but
Government employees, but on the whole the trials
and anxieties of their lives are no greater than those
that fall to the common lot, if in fact they are as
great.
This paper is not a bid for recruits. Nevertheless,
correspondents sometimes want to know how to obtain
a position in the Patent Office. Information concern-
ing this matter may be had by addressing an inquiry
to the Civil Service Commission, Washington, D. C.
Others want to know how to obtain a patent, or desire
other information concerning patents. This may be
had on request made to the Commissioner of Patents,
Washington, D. C.
It may be well to add a word concerning the differ-
ent kinds of work intrusted to the Patent Office. First
and most important of these is the granting of letters
patent for the protection of mechanical and chemical
or semi-chemical and electrical inventions. Next per-
haps in importance is the registration of trade marks.
These last named aids to commerce are of far greater
importance than is commonly supposed. The prepara-
tion of applications for both patents and trade marks
can, as a rule, be properly done only by experts. De-
sign patents arc also handled by the Patent Office, but
copyrights on books, papers, musical scores, etc., go to
the Librarian of Congress, Washington, D. C.
At present there are sixty or seventy thousand ap-
plications awaiting action on the part of the Patent
Office and others are pouring in at a rate that can
be compared only to the rush of the river of straw that
that descends on the head of the unhappy individual
who is placed under the stacker of a threshing machine,
and who must dispose of it or perish by smothering,
so don't expect a patent a week after you file your
application, and also please consider the possibility that
some other fellow has conceived your great idea and
received a patent thereon before your were born.
At the suggestion of the appointing officer, I will
add that positions as fourth assistant examiners have
been for some time, and still are, open to all who pass
the civil service examinations. These positions are
particularly congenial to those whose tastes are both
scientific and legal and are attainable without difficulty
by enginering graduates. The examining corps of the
Patent Office has always held a high place among the
scientific branches of the Government, and its worth
is recognized and appreciated wherever out patent
svstem is known.


Rolling and Manufacturing into Tubing
Concluded from January, 1923
Col. H. W. Miller
Department of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing
The gold, platinum, etc., left at the bottom of the
vat is removed and cast into an anode almost identical
in shape with the multiple anode but only about six
inches square, and of course with the two small ears
at the top. These anodes are put into a glass tank
with thin sheets of pure gold between and refined by
the multiple process, the electrolyte being gold chlor-
ide. Pure gold is deposited on the thin sheets and the
platinum, palladium, etc., go into solution and later are
precipitated out of the solution as granular platinum,
and so on. The gold is shipped to the market in the
6 by 6 by J4 mch cathode shapes that come out of the
refinery.
Rolling
It was mentioned under the subject of refined cast-
ing that refined copper is cast into cakes of various
size as to length, width, and thickness according to
the sheets that are to be made from these cakes. Since
approximately 40 per cent of the copper which goes
into the rolling mills as cakes comes back to the refined
casting house as "scrap" to be recast, it is desirable
to prepare the copper for the rolling mill in such
shape as to eliminate waste as much as possible. A
principle that seems at once perfectly reasonable but
is not generally known, that is, that cakes of copper
passed through the rolls do not increase in width, is an
important one in the preparation of the copper for the
rolling. If sheets 24 inches in width are desired, the
cakes are given a similar width and a thickness com-
mensurate with the length of sheet desired. It is ne-
cessary to pre-heat all copper in the rolling mills to ap-
proximately 10000, that is, a bright red, before rolling.
The furnace used for this purpose is approximately 20
feet long by 6 feet wide and 3 feet high inside. The
copper cakes are lifted from the flat cars to the table
at the rear of this furnace by means of air-hoists and
shoved into the furnace one after another by an air-
ram. As the cakes are forced into the rear of the
furnace they are of course pushed out at the front,
where they are received on a special two-wheeled
truck by means of which they are transferred to the
table of the break-down rolls.
The rolls on which the copper is broken down, or
rough-rolled, to the approximate thickness first desired
are three high-rolls, that is, three rolls arranged above
each other, the center roll being free to move up and
down between the top and bottom. The only roll that
it is necessary to feed in changing the thickness of the
sheet is, therefore, the top roll. These rolls may vary
in length from four to six feet and are seldom less than
24 inches in diamater. They are of a special grade of
cast iron and are chilled on the surface to a depth of
from three-eighths to three-quarters of an inch to with-
stand the excessive wear of rolling the hot copper.
Fhey are kept well ground to make them well polished.
It is necessary to flush the rolls with oil frequently
and water is kept running over them all of the time,
even while the hot copper is passing through. The
cake of copper is pushed by man power between the
bottom and center roll and is received on the other
side on a steam operated lifting-table which raises it
to a position to return between the middle and top
roll. On its return it drops to the table and is pushed
in again after the top roll has been run down. By suc-
cessive passes back and forth a four or six-inch cake is
finally reduced to a thickness of from one-half to one-
quarter inch, the width remaining approximately the
same as the original cake unless it is desired to in-
crease it, in which case the cake is first fed through
at a slight angle which tends to roll it not only in length
but in width.
Cooling the Rollers
As the rolling of the hot sheets progresses of
course the rolls become hot and expand most in the
center. It is necessary to keep cold water running
over the rools, especially in the break-down mill, and
in the sheet-mill steam pipes are arranged so that live
steam may be blown on the rolls as well as water.
From time to time it is necessary to discontinue roll-
ing and turn on the steam and likewise run cold water
over the rolls for a time to bring them down to a safe
temperature. If permitted to heat too much they will
begin to crack and finally burst from the expansion.
It is not a rare occurrence to have the very large rolls
break in the center, sometimes diagonally and some-
times at right angles to the axis. As the rolls increase
in size in the center, of course it is impossible to roll
a perfect sheet, hence an added necessity for keeping
the rolls as cool as possible. The rolls in all of these
mills are usually in trains of four or five, being driven
by a motor located somewhere in the center of the set
of four or five, or perhaps on occasion the motor may
(30)


Page 31

TECHNIC

be located at the end. Thus the one line of rolls may
be connected by spindles and the motor drives the en-
tire set at the same tme. Very heavy motors are re-
quired for this purpose, and reduction gears are re-
quired to reduce the speed. Some of the rolls of the
train may be used for rolling hot copper while others
may be used for rolling the cold.
Shearing the Sheets
When the copper is finally broken down to the de-
sired thickness it is transferred to the rough cutting
shears where it is cut itno small sheets of such a size
as will make, when further rolled, the sheets of 10, 12,
14, or 16 ounce copper of desired size, that is 24 by
96.30 by 96, etc., with a sufficient margin for trimming
off ragged edges and leaving clean sheets. The mill in
which the copper is broken down from the cakes to
the thick black sheets and sheared to other sheets of
a size for further rolling is known as the hot or
break-down mill. Large sheets of great thickness
may be rolled in this mill,—sheets as much as 6 feet
in width by 12 to 15 feet in length by an inch thick
for beating into large copper vats, or for use as loco-
motive boilers, tube sheets, and other special purposes
which require very large sheets of heavy material.
The same mill is provided with annealing furnaces
capable of taking the largest sheets that can be rolled.
Such furnaces in this mill are from 12 to 20 feet long
by 7 or 8 feet wide and about 3 feet high inside. They
are made entirely of brick, lined with fire brick and are
oil fired. Cast iron rails are provided on the floor in
front into which the sheet of copper is dropped when
drawn from the furnace red hot. It is practically
always necessary and usually desirable to anneal these
large sheets of copper to relieve the strains that have
been set up in the rolling. After they have been an-
nealed they are laid on a straightening floor made of
heavy plank or iron and the buckles straightened out
either by rolling over them one of the heavy cast iron
rolls or by stamping with heavy two-man wood stamps.
Re-rolling the Shearings
The small sheets of thick black copper sheared
from the large sheets coming from the bread-down
mills are taken to the second hot rolling mill where
they are again placed in heating furnaces, which in
this case are fed from the front. These furnaces are
not materially unlike the furnace already described,
and arc likewise oil fired. When the sheets of copper
have reached a red heat they are removed and passed
repeatedly through a set of rolls, in this case only two
high, until they are reduced to the minimum thickness
that can be secured with a single set.
When the sheets have reached a thickness of about
1-16 of an inch, four sheets are stacked on each other,
making what is known as a "pack." These are again
heated and then rolled until each has reached the de-
sired thickness to make what is known as 10, 12, 14,
16 ounce copper, which means the weight in ounces
per square foot. The copper rolls render them uniform
in packs, and if the sheets when placed in packs are
of approximately the same thickness, they are reduced
in thickness at about the same rate. In this rolling into
thin sheets the edges become very ragged and it is ne-
cessary to shear off sometimes as much as two or three
inches from each edge to produce a clean sheet.
Sheet Copper Diverted to Various Channels
After being rolled into thin sheets the copper be-
gins to travel different routes. It may be desired to
produce (1) soft, annealed, unpolished copper, (2)
soft polished copper, (3) soft polished and tinned
copper, (4) hard, cold-rolled unpolished, (5) hard,
cold-rolled polished, (6) hard, cold-rolled, polished and
tinned, etc.
For the production of soft unpolished copper the
sheets are bundled into thick packs, wrapped about with
sheets of scrap copper, and placed in an annealing fur-
nace where they are in a manner soaked in heat for
from ten to twelve hours. When removed they are
either dropped into a tank of water or sprayed until
cool. They are then sheared to size, passed through a
cleaning tank of dilute sulphuric acid, washed, dried,
and packed for shipment. If they are to be converted
into hard copper, they are taken to a third mill where
only cold rolling is done. In this mill the rolls are
kept polished to a very high degree and very accurate
as to dimensions. Here the sheets are rolled cold until
they have the desired thickness. The rolls in this mill
are arranged likewise in trains of four or five and
differ but little if any from the rolls in the previous
mills. When the cold-rolling has been finished, these
same sheets are trimmed to size and passed through
tanks of dilute sulphuric acid for cleaning and then
washed and dried. From this point hard and soft cop-
per may follow similar routes. That is, if it is desired
to produce polished copper they are taken to the pol-
ishing room which is equipped with large polishing
machines, principal elements of which are horizontal
shafts on which discs of cloth about 20 inches in dia-
meter are strung to a length of about four feet and
clamped very tightly, making almost a solid cylinder of
cloth. This cylinder is rubbed with a composition of
rouge (finely ground iron ore) and tallow which is
provided in cake form. The sheet of copper is laid on
a board which rests on a roller in front of the machine,
and the operator passes this board with the sheet of
copper rapidly back and forth under the roller until
it is thoroughly polished. These polished sheets are
then placed in the shipping cases with sheets of tissue
paper between.

If it is desired to produce tinned copper, which by
the way is tinned on one side only, the soft annealed
sheets are taken to the tinning room where a series of
tables of ordinary height are provided, each having a
gas fire about 15 inches square in the center. The op-
erator places the sheet of copper on the table with one
end over the fire and throws on a sheet of pure tin
about 6 inches square by 1-32 inch thick and some
powdered sal ammoniac. He has in one hand a large
bundle of cotton tightly rolled, or perhaps cotton waste,
with which he wipes the tin over the surface of the
copper as soon as it melts. With this bundle of cotton
he is able to wipe the tin from one end of the sheet to
the other, getting it smooth, as one finds it in the var-
ious tinned copper vessels that we purchase. Each
man is able to tin approximately 1800 square feet of
copper per day by this method. A machine was de-
signed by the writer while serving as engineer of this
plant for the tinning of these sheets, the principle of
which was merely that a mechanical means was pro-
vided of feeding the sheets of copper over the fire,
leaving the one operator entirely free to spread the
tin while another operator—a boy—fed the sheets in.
This machine was so designed that the heat given out
by the gas heater was approximately proportionate to
the speed at which the sheet passed through. That is,
any movement of the rheostat arm to increase or de-
crease the speed of the motor turned on more or less
gas. This machine has been found particularly valu-
able for the tinning of long strip copper, the strips be-
ing about 12 inches wide by 100 feet long for conver-
sion into moulding for show-windows, counters, etc.,
and for spouting, coping, etc. It had not been found
easily possible to tin these rolls of copper before the
making of this machine.
The tinned copper is practically always polished on
both sides and by far the greater percentage of it is
used in the making of wash-boilers and electric wash-
ing machines. It is quite amazing how the demand for
copper for these purposes has increased in the past few
years.
Wire
The copper which was destined to become wire was
cast in the casting house into bars 4 by 6 inches by
from 32 to (X, inches. These bars are taken to the wire
mill, reheated and passed through a series of several
1 oils in which they arc broken down finally to a rod or
wire approximately J4 inch in diameter. These sets
of rolls are all two-high and a single pair of rolls may
have throughout their length grooves of various sec-
tion, that is, one groove will roll the bar of copper into
an elliptical section, the next into square section, the
rext into round section, then elliptical section again,
ctc. It is in this mill that the copper is put to a very
severe test. If its oxygen content is not just right it
is very likely that the wire will break at some time in
the rolling or drawing.
After the bar has been reduced to a coil of wire
about 54 inch in diameter, the end of this wire is point-
ed and started through the first die. The drawing
dies are of especially hard cast iron about two inches
in diameter outside and about one inch thick. A large
conical hole has been cast in the front end and the
drawing edge finished by grinding. The drawing edge
is very close to the side of the die from which the rod
emerges, and, perhaps contrary to one's first concep-
tion, the wire is drawn practically over a knife edge in-
stead of through a cylinder. By this it is meant that
the grinders by means of which the dies are finished
are conical and the die is ground from the front ancf
then from the real until the two cones meet, thereby
producing a drawing edge instead of a drawing cylin-
der. It has been found impracticable to reduce the
wire more than a certain percentage of its diameter in
each pass of the die, and hence the graduation in dies
from one down in size or up in number by intervals
of one.
A special composition is fed over the dies, or the
wire is passed through the composition before passing
through the dies to lubricate the drawing and reduce
the wear on the die and the effect of scratching on the
wire. By this procedure the wire is drawn through
one die after another until it is reduced to the desired
diameter. Below a certain diameter, approximately
1-25 inch, the wire is drawn through diamond dies in-
stead of iron, it being impracticable to produce metal
dies of so small a size. During this drawing it is neces-
sary to anneal the wire by passing it through oil fired
furnaces after passing through each three or four dies.
If drawn through too many dies before annealing it
would become brittle and the surface would crack.
Tubes
For the production of tubes the copper is cast in
the refined casting house into billets or cylinders of
any desired diameter and length. These cylinders
when taken to the tube mill are reheated and placed in
what is known as a piercing machine where a steel core
is forced entirely through the billet, making of it a
crude pipe. This pipe is then rolled somewhat larger
than the diameter desired of the tubing. Since the
inside of the tubing is to have approximately a given
diameter, the diameter of the piercing rod must be
gaged accordingly because the inside diameter will be
reduced constantly in proportion to the outside dia-
meter. From this point it is drawn through dies not
unlike those already described for the wire until re-
duced to the desired outside dimension. By these
methods of drawing it is possible to produce the very
fine tubing one-eighth inch in diameter with a hole not
larger than onc-thirty-second of an inch in diameter


Page 33
MICHIGAN
TECHNIC

that one finds used for various special purposes. If
the tubing is to be quite small it may finally be coiled
on a drum, while if it is to be large, that is, Y\ inch or
larger, it must be drawn approximately straight, and
after it has been reduced below a certain diameter it
must be cut into sections of a proper length as in the
case of the rough-rolled sheets of copper in the break-
down mill which were cut into sizes to be rolled into
thin sheets. After final drawing the large tubes are
straightened on a special straightening table or passed
through straightening rolls in a direction diagonal to
the axis of the rolls and then placed in tanks of dilute
sulphuric acid for cleaning. They are then washed and
dried.
The ingots of copper produced in the refined cast-
ing house may be destined to- produce articles of pure
copper, such as soldering irons, or stamped or cast cop-
per articles, or possibly they may be intended to pro-
duce brass, which is an alloy of copper, zinc and lead,
or bronze, which is a combination of copper and tin.
The wedge cakes which are about 4 by 12 by
14 to 18 inches are rolled into sheets about J/g inch
thick by 12 inches in width and cut into discs 12 inches
in diameter. These are very carefully straightened
and are used by the phonograph record companies as
the master record, that is, the original record for re-
production. The plastic material which we finally re-
ceive as the phonograph record is spread over the cop-
per impression, pressed flat and vulcanized by heat.
Copper has been found to be one of the best metals to
use in connection with the vulcanizing of rubber or
rubber products since the rubber has the 'east ten-
dency to stick to this metal. Unusually large quanti-
ties are required for the making of these master rec-
ords and the copper must be of excellent grade to avoid
flaws of any character in the surface of the rolled
sheet.
Shortage of Copper During the War
It may be well to observe before we end this article
that during the war the Central Allies were so very
hard pressed for copper for the making of its alloys
or for its use directly that they were compelled to find
substitutes. At the beginning of the war it was the
practice of practically all nations to make their shell
cases of brass. As soon as the supply of copper began
to run so dangerously low, German metallurgists and
engineers set about to find satisfactory substitutes.
They finally produced a grade of iron that answered
rather satisfactorily for the production of their shell
cases. Apprently also they succeeded in producing
alloys which answered fairly well as a substitute for
brass and bronze in bearings. The demand for copper
from Germany, which was a large consumer before
the war, does not seem now to be commensurate with
the demand that the conditions seem to warrant. It is
not known whether Europe in general has managed
to find sufficient substitutes or not, but it is a fact that
the copper producing corporations in America are find-
ing it necessary to secure new uses for their product,
and almost for the first time in their history are being
compelled to consider selling organizations, selling
campaigns, and new and attractive forms into which
their product may be converted for sale to the gene'ral
public.
Copper Used on Projectiles
Copper has a characteristic not possessed in the
same degree by any other metal which has fitted it
almost alone for use in the rotating bands of projectiles.
To those who are compelled to work with copper it is
found to have a most stubborn toughness that gives
great trouble.
Apparently there is a certain amount of elasticity
to the metal not of a character with which we are fa-
miliar in other metals. If the rotating band of a pro-
jectile were made of zinc or lead, for example, and the
projectile forced into the gun, as soon as the rotating
band had passed into the grooves the friction would
probably be very materially reduced. When the copper
band, however, is forced into the grooves there seems
to be a sufficient spring to the metal as with rubber to
force it out into the grooves and produce the desired
seal against the escape of gasses. Probably the attend-
ant friction must be tolerated for the benefit derived
from this effective seal.
Another characteristic which is not so generally
thought of is its high conductivity of heat. It is not
possible to cut any very large piece of copper with an
acetylene torch. It would be quite an easy matter to
split a block of steel one foot thick with an acetylene
torch, but this would be quite impossible with copper
since the metal would conduct the heat away so rapidly
as to make it impossible to secure even a red heat.
On several occasions furnaces at the Baltimore Copper
\Yorks have burnt out and several hundred tons of
copper run out over the floors and into the pits. Under
such circumstances the only thing that can be done is
to dig a tunnel under this slab of copper when it is cool,
line the tunnel on the inside with brick and place a
huge oil fire at one end and fire the tunnel as though it
were a furnace. The top of the tunnel must be covered
with earth or ashes to prevent the escape of heat. The
copper is slowly melted down from the roof of the
tunnel until the slab is split. In this manner the slab
may finally be divided into sections small enough to be
charged again into the furnaces. This is a character-
istic of silver also. On one occasion the silver furnace
burst and a slab of silver from 6 to 8 inches thick was
produced on the floors of the smelting house. The
only thing that could be done in this case was to raise
the slab and build a tunnel of brick under it.

Recovery of Waste
As one passes around a copper smelter, refinery and
rolling mills one is impressed with the fact that scrap
seems to be lying every place. It is perfectly true that
hot copper is always splashing out over the ground and
scrap copper seems to be every place, but very little
escapes from the plant. Each plant has its own blast
furnace into which all refuse from every plant except
perhaps cinders from the boilers are charged, together
with limestone, coke, and slag, and converted into cakes
of copper which in turn go through the crude casting
house for another refining. It is said facetiously that
some of the copper about the average copper works
of today has been going around the plant for the last
fifty years! This might literally be true since it is a
complete cycle for the scrap or waste copper.
TRANSIT UP, BY NUMBERS
(Continued from Page 24)
across the lawn of the chateau at sur-Ternoise
set apart for the newspaper men; I quite distinctly
heard Philip Gibbs' typewriter grinding out all that
could be told. We tiptoed through Montreuil, which
was so sacred that dispatch-riders must shut off their
engines and coast through it lest they should disturb
the meditations of some British general.
Our battalion, after a scramble away from the Ger-
man March offensive and after a feverish spell of
trench-digging and machine gun drill, settled down to
a summer of building standard gauge. George Rex
Imperatorque with a carload of "brass hats" honored
us with a visit. A big Australian engine-driver raced
the royal train up our newly-laid and poorly-ballasted
track at a speed of perhaps 15 miles an hour. There
is a borrow-pit near Conchil-le-Tempel whose four
stakes (if some frugal Frenchwoman has not found
them for kindling) still bear the words: God, Save,
The, King.
During the summer our headquarters "acquired" in
true army fashion enough cars to put itself on wheels.
We followed the victorious advance, double-tracking
the line Marcoing-Cambrai-Le Quesnoy. On Novem-
ber 11 we were given a rum ration at supper-time,
and on the 12th there arrived copies of the Times
announcing under headlines at least a quarter, inch
high that the war was over. Hostilities ceased, but
futilities went right on.
Of course, we sometimes grumbled and used lan-
guage more vile than Shunk had in mind when he
put that pious paragraph into his field book, but as a
lump we assayed high in cheerfulness. Some trench
Henley put it:
If a nine-point-two
Detonates on you,
It's Nah-poo, tiddely-oo,
Good-byeee.

In the above list are included only those projects
which directly tie into the railroad from immediately
tributary areas. They are all shown on accompanying
map. The existing and proposed extension of these
routes to all other parts of the Territory are also an
essential part of a transportation system based upon
the Government Railroad.
Now that the Government Railroad is completed, a
very interesting circular tour may be taken as shown
on the accompanying map, viz., in over the Govern-
ment Railroad and out over the Richardson Highway
by automobile. The entire trip may be made in twenty-
five days from Seattle back to Seattle, without any
hardships or serious inconveniences and at a very rea-
sonable cost. Nowhere in the world will more mag-
nificent scenery be found.
The Chemistry of Combustion
By J. Newton Friend, D. Sc., Ph. D., Head ot
Chemistry Dept., Muncipal Technical School, Bir-
mingham. $1.25 net, D. Van Nostrand Co.
An interesting compendium of data on the sci-
ence of combustion has been brought together and
arranged in a very interesting manner by the author
in this little monograph. It deals with the history
of the subject, describing the theories held by the
earliest chemists. Among these are the various
ideas pertaining to the Phlogiston theory.
In the first chapter, definitions pertinent to com-
bustion are discussed, as a proper understanding
of the subject is necessary. The combustion of solid
carbon is developed into the combustion of the hy-
drocarbons. Theories which develop as one goes
along are discussed thoroughly.
The book is one that would be valuable not only
to the chemist but to the layman as well, for the
language is simple and not at all technical. Con-
tents: Definitions — Phlogiston — Combustion of
Solid Carbon—Flame—Combustion of Gaseous Hy-
drocarbons and Other Gases—Ignition Tempera-
tures—Inflammation of Gaseous Mixtures—Propo-
gation of Flame in Gaseous Mixtures—Surface Com-
bustion—Bibliography and Notes.
It is estimated that the smoke nuisance costs Chi-
cago $50,000,000 a year.

A LEXANDER ZIWET was born February 8, 1853,
at Breslau, Germany, of a Polish father and a
German mother. His father was a landed proprietor.
Up to his twelfth year he was educated at home by pri-
vate tutors. He then attended for five years the gymna-
sium at Glogau, German Silesia, graduating in 1870.
His father having died
in the meantime, he joined
his mother and sisters at
Warsaw, Russian Poland,
learned the Polish and Rus-
sian languages, and entered
the University of Warsaw.
In 1873 he transferred to
the University of Moscow
for a year, leaving in 1874
to study Mathematics and
Engineering in Germany.
After spending some time
in an architect's office at
Berlin, he entered the Poly-
technic School at Karls-
ruhe, Baden. There also
he served the required year
in the army (artillery),
passing the examinations
for a lieutenancy in the re-
serve. Professor Ziwet is
very much opposed to mili-
tarism, and that was his
main reason for leaving for
America after finishing his
studies. In the summer of
1880 he passed the exam-
inations for a diploma in
Civil Engineering. Previous to this, in 1878-9, he had
published a German translation of I. Somoff's (Rus-
sian) "Theoretical Mechanics," at Leipsig, Taubner,
2 vols.
In the fall of 1880 he came to the United States,
locating at Detroit. m After two years with the United
States Lakes Survey and five years with the computing
division of the United States Coast and Geodetic Sur-

Professor Alexander Ziwet
vey, Washington, D. C, he became Instructor in Math-
ematics at the University of Michigan in 1888, where
he was gradually promoted to be Assistant Professor,
Associate Professor, and full Professor in 1904.
Professor Ziwet has published several works on
Mathematics and allied subjects. In 1893-4 he pub-
lished a work on Mechanics
in three parts, later com-
bined into one volume
under the title of "Theo-
retical Mechanics." In 1912
he brought out, in collabo-
ration with Professor Peter
Field, a volume on Analyti-
cal Mechanics. In 1913
there appeared the "Ana-
lytical Geometry and Prin-
ciples of Algebra," by Pro-
fessors Ziwet and Hopkins,
which has been used as a
text for some years in the
Engineering College. At
present, his interest is in
Vector Analysis and its ap-
plications to Mechanics and
Mathematical Physics.
He has been a member of
the Council of the American
Mathematical Society, co-
editor of its bulletin, ami
was vice-president of the
society in 1902-3. He is
also a member of the
mathematical societies of
Germany and France, of
the Washington Academy of Science and the Math-
ematical Association of America.
Professor Ziwet was granted leave of absence in
1898-9 to study in the Universities of Paris and Got-
tingen. At various times he traveled, visiting Ger-
many, France, and Italy.
He is an accomplished linguist, being well acquainted
with nearly all European languages and the Classics.

His mother tongue was German, and at the Gymnasium
French, English, Latin, and Greek were taught. Later,
he had opportunity to study Italian, which he under-
stands and reads. He is a true scholar, reading very
widely, and having an intimate acquaintance with the
classical and modern literature as well as a broad
knowldege of general subjects.
He is a very modest man and dislikes to discuss any
subject which has to do with himself. The Apostles
Club, which numbers among its members unmarried
men of the faculty, claims him as one of its charter
members. Next to Dean Cooley, he is Senior Profes-
sor of the Engineering College.
All who associate with him, whether in the classroom
or professionally, will remember him as a thorough
instructor and for his ability as a mathematician, and
anyone who has met him and talked with him will
alwavs remember him as a modest man and a scholar.
THE ENGINEERING College as well as other col-
leges of the University sulTered from an increase in
tuition at the hands of the Board of Regents, but the
latter institution beamed upon the Engineer and only
increased the rates $3 a year, making the tuition $100
for residents and $125 for non-residents. We can
indeed feel lucky that we are not Medics, who have to
pay about $100 more than their present fees.
FOR SEVERAL years Dean Cooley has been work-
ing with the faculty for a curriculum which will include
five years of study. Other Engineering colleges have
been working in a similar vein. However, no one
school wants to take the initiative, attd for this reason
the faculty of the Engineering College rejected the
proposed curriculum. It is unlikely that a five-year
course of study will be developed until all of the lead-
ing Engineering colleges can cooperate to offer such
courses at the same time.
(T^jFTEN the weary undergraduate wonders how
the young instructor gets that way, when he sits
up in front of the class and begins to get chesty.
Hits of sarcasm, very choice indeed, float out over the
class when one of its members unwittingly displays a
little ignorance. One is given the impression that
young instructors must be extremely brilliant and intel-
ligent, else they would not make ironic remarks about
the intellectual weaknesses of others.
A professor once remarked that if it was not fur
some of these cocky instructors a university faculty
would be a group of intellectual giants. The men who
become great professors do not do so because of their
ability and willingness to make slurring remarks about
undergraduate intelligence, and neither do they pose
as know-it-alls. They are men who are willing to
help their students and to treat them fairly and
squarely at all times, acting friendly toward their stu-
dents without disastrous results. When one comes into
contact with such professors, he wonders why some of
the underlings must lord it over the student as though
the latter had few if any rights.
However, not all young instructors are of a sarcastic
frame of mind. Scattered here and there one will find
some who are human.
King "Tut"
HP HE recent discovery of the ancient tomb of King
Tutankhamen at Luxor, Egypt, has created much
excitement because of the fabulous treasures reported
to have been found. Egyptologists and tourists have
flocked by the hundreds to see this last resting place
of an ancient Pharaoh and to grab a few souvenirs
when the guards were not looking. All this is very
interesting, of course, but another phase of the dis-
covery has been almost entirely overlooked. That is
the methods used by the Pharaohs in constructing their
mammoth tombs. The engineer notices with what
great precision the stones are cut and laid oiv top of
each other.' The blocks are at least 13 feet long and
perhaps as wide and usually 6 to 10 feet thick. Yet.
in spite of these large dimensions, each face fits the
adjacent face accurately, even with a quarter inch
layer of cement for bondage. Modern methods and
contrivances have failed to produce such accuracy and
permanency, and one may well wonder how the Egyp-
tians achieved their results.
The Egyptologist might well abandon the mummy,
sarcophagus, papyrus, and treasures for the time being
and make an exhaustive study of the ways and means
of tomb construction. If any information of value
could be found, the modern engineer might do well to
study it. It is certain that the Egyptians knew the
elementary principles of mechanics, but do the records
reveal any such knowledge? This is a worth while
problem for the archaeologist.
E ALL know that whenever it rains, or more
especially, whenever it RAINS, this campus of
ours takes on a decidedly pre-Volstead appearance.
The campus walks, whose artistic layout is said to be
the pride of the landscape department, remind us of
"the roads built through swamps" these highway
experts tell us about. Is it not a shame that our "intel-
lectual playground," whose altitude is 881.86 feet
above sea level (see bench-mark on library), should
be thusly transformed into a Venice every time the
heavens weep? •
Surely, here is a problem that should make an Engi-
neer take out his slide rule and hand-book and do some

hard thinking. Even now one of us has the solution
buried away in that mass of gray matter from which
comes the answer to all our problems, and all that it
is necessary to do is to dig it out and thereby add one
more laurel to our noble profession.
Of course, there are probably more methods than
one by which we could remove this cause for lamenta-
tion. The "Engineers" who spend most of their time
in the chem building might suggest that we place the
campus under a hood containing a dish of H,SO4 and
let the acid take up the water; while our neighbors,
the architects, might want to build a dome or roof over
it and keep out the rain in the first place. Or worse
yet, the double flunkers (EE's) might want to drive
the water off by means of alternating currents!
The problem is before us, gentlemen, and to show
the extent of its interest in the matter THE TECHNIC
has very kindly offered a handsome portrait of its
"Silent Salesman" to the man who offers a practical
solution.
THE BOARD of Regents has granted leave of
absence for a year to Professor Walter L. Badger, of
the Chemical Engineering Department, and has
appointed Mr. R. H. Hayward to fill his place. Pro-
fessor Badger is working on research for the Swenn-
son Evaporator Company and conducting a consulting
service on evaporator problems. The work is being
done on the campus in the evaporator laboratory.
Professor Badger is not conducting any classes, but is
continuing to supervise research by advanced students.
THE FEDERATED American Engineering Socie-
ties, of which Dean Cooley is president, have under-
taken to study Engineering education with the view
of possible improvements and changes. The tendency
some years ago was directed away from a broad edu-
cation toward a specialization in technology. The
result was that Engineers became expert technicians
without any trained ability to manage an executive
position. The committee appointed is striving to dis-
cover what practicing Engineers think about needed
improvements and at the same time is taking a concen-
sus of undergraduate opinion.
THE AIR SERVICE of the United States Army
has established for itself an enviable record. Handi-
capped by reduction of its personnel, equipment, and
appropriations, it has succeeded in bringing to this
country the honor of world's records for speed, endur-
ance, altitude, and long-distance non-stop flights.
Planes which can fly four miles in one minute, climb
seven and a half miles, remain in the air for a day and
a half, and fly 2,000 miles without a stop-—these are
indeed accomplishments.
MARINE ANIMALS are made partly of metal.
Miss H. W. Severy, of Leland Stanford University,
has discovered, by examination of sixteen denizens of
the sea, from shrimp to whales, that all contain zinc
and most of them copper. It has been known for
years that copper is present in oysters, sometimes col-
oring them green or giving them a metallic taste. Sea
urchins, sea anemone, shrimp, crabs, salmon, and sea-
lions have copper in their systems. The copper content
amounts to about five parts in ten million, while the
zinc approximates four parts in one million.
Artificial Sunlight for Testing Fastness of Colors
A unique and interesting device which simulates
the qualities of sun rays and will artificially test
the fading qualities of many different kinds of ma-
terials, has recently been developed in the labora-
tories of the Cooper-Hewitt Electric Company.
Testing the fastness of colored cloths, paints,
inks, dyes, straw, varnishes, etc., is accomplished
more efficiently by means of this apparatus and in
much shorter time than the customary method, now
in use by manufacturers in giving long sunlight
tests to their products before marketing.
A light that is faster and better than sunlight is
needed in the routine testing of materials for their
resistance to its destructive action. The sunlight
method is so slow as to defeat its own purpose in
the control of factory products or the examination
of incoming materials.
Practically all of the color fading, rubber ageing,
skin tanning effects of sunlight are due not to the
visible light, but to the invisible, ultra-violet light.
The ultra-violet or invisible rays of sunlight have
little effect on human beings due to the absorption
of much of them in the atmosphere. The artificial
fading cabinet is, however, built to produce a light
with a high concentration of ultra-violet rays. This
is secured through the use of the mercury vapor arc
light in a buIb or tube of pure glass of fused quartz
the radiation from which contains a relatively very
much larger proportion of short wave ultra-violet
light and less of heat waves such as produced by the
carbon or other types of arc lights.
Around this light is a series of panels which may
be revolved and in which are placed the materials
to be tested. Twenty or more samples may be ex-
posed at one time. The rate of fading averages 12
times that of sunlight. A 3o-day sunlight test which
would require ordinarily about two months (due to
interruptions on cloudy or rainy days) can now be
made in 10 hours.
Ceylon, in proportion to its size, produces a greater
quantity of graphite and of purer quality than any oth-
er part of the world.

William W. Campbell, '86E.
President of the University of California
ICHIGAN engineers are making a name for
themselves and for their Alma Mater in non-
engineering work as well as in strictly engineering
positions. The latest engineering graduate to be hon-
ored is William Wallace Campbell, the new president
of the University of
California.
Dr. Campbell was
lx,rn in Hancock Coun-
ty, Ohio, on April II,
1862. His father and
mother were both of
Scotch ancestry, and,
like so many other
sjreat men, he was a
farmer's son, working
is a farm lalx&gt;rer dur-
ing summer vacations,
and helping his father
after school hours dur-
ing the winter months.
He attended the public
schools until fifteen
years of age, then high
school, and afterwards,
from 1881 to 1882,
taught school.
In 1882 Dr. Camp-
bell entered the Uni-

William Wallace Campbell
but was unsuccessful. He was then appointed pro-
fessor of mathematics at the University of Colorado,
where he met the future Mrs. Campbell in one of his
classes. Dr. Campbell states that he spent "a happy
two years" there. From 1888 to 1891 he was instructor
in astronomy and as-
sistant in Detroit Ob-
servatory of the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
He spent three months'
of the summer of 1891
as volunteer assistant
at the Lick Observa-
tory, working under
Professor Holden and
Astronomer Keeler. At
the withdrawal of Pro-
fessor Shaeberle, Pro-
fessor had Campbell
appointed in charge of
the spectroscopic de-
partment. On January
1, 1901, he was made
director of the Observ-
atory.
For twenty years Dr.
Campbell has ruled the
independent little prin-
cipality atop of Mt.
versity of Michigan, planning to become a civil engi-
neer. However, during the latter part of his junior
year, while browsing in the University Library, he
happened to come upon Simon Newcomb's "Popular
Astronomy." He became intensely interested in it,
took it to his room, and read it through in one night.
From that time on he knew that he was going to be an
astronomer. The next year he completed the require-
ments for the degree of bachelor of science in engi-
neering, but studied astronomy in his spare time. This
led to his acquaintance with Professor Shaeberle, a
member of the staff of Lick Observatory.
After graduation he sought a position as astronomer,
Hamilton. Of course, the University of California
holds a mandate over this principality, but the one who
really guides the destinies of the community is the
director of Lick Observatory. Here, in a setting of
inspired grandeur, with the great range of the Sierra
Nevada to the east and the coast range close at hand,
some sixty persons live in comfort and contentment,
twenty-five miles from San Jose, the nearest city. The
population includes men of science—astronomers and
their assistants, instructors, students who are working
for cherished degrees, the necessary workmen, and the
families of those stationed there. Just below the big
brick observatory and administration building is a gov-

ernment postoffice, a public school, new homes for the
staff, a lighting and power plant—virtually all the
services a modern community enjoys. There are also
very good roads.
Mrs. Campbell was his unfailing companion on every
expedition to foreign shores in the interest of science,
chief of which were the Lick Observatory eclipse expe-
dition to India in 1897, to Spain in 1905, and to Kiev,
Russia in 1914. He has three sons—Wallace, who is
in the bond business in San Francisco; Douglas, who
is in charge of a 30,000-acre sugar plantation in Peru;
and Kenneth, a graduate student in Harvard Univer-
sity. All three saw service in the great war.
Dr. Campbell found his engineering training of great
advantage when he designed the Mills spectrograph
in 1896, after experimenting for many years. This
instrument is attached to the "eye end" of the great
telescope at the observatory. In this way the velocities
of 2,000 stars in all parts of the sky have been observed.
The instrument gave results of such high accuracy
that it opened up a new field for astronomical research;
in fact, it caused Dr. Campbell to establish a branch
observatory near Santiago, Chile.
When the board of regents of the University of Cal-
ifornia offered him the presidency of that great insti-
tution, he accepted it only on the condition that he be
allowed to keep his position at Lick Observatory as a
dollar-a-year man. To this the board readily agreed.
Dr. Campbell has been honored by practically all the
leading scientific societies of the world. He is presi-
dent of the International Astronomical Union and of
the American Astronomical Society. Honorary degrees
have been conferred upon him by the University of
Michigan, the University of Wisconsin, the University
of Western Pennsylvania, and recently by the Univer-
sity of Western Australia in appreciation of his recent
eclipse expedition to that country.

oAn Important Invention
The Universal Milling Machine was one of
the most important machine-tool inventions
which sprang from the necessities of the
Civil War.
At that time, the manufacture of percussion
nipples required large numbers of twist drills
made by the best method then known—filing
spiral grooves in steel wire with a rat-tail
file.
Hand-filing was so expensive that Mr. Joseph
R. Brown, of J. R. Brown C&amp; Sharpe, was
consulted as to the possibility of a machine
for grooving these drills.
The result was the Universal Milling Ma-
chine, suitable for many kinds of spiral
milling, gear cutting and other work pre-
viously done by hand.
From this beginning the Brown C&amp;, Sharpe
line has grown to include over 30 sizes of
milling machines—Universal, Plain, Vertical
Spindle and Automatic. A large number of
these are heavy machines particularly suited
to production work.

BRINGING MORE DAYLIGHT INTO INDUSTRIAL
BUILDINGS.
Dr. George M. Price, writing on "The Importance of
Light in Factories," in "The Modern Factory," states:
"Light is an essential working condition in all industrial
establishments, and is also of paramount influence in the
preservation of the health of the workers. There is no
condition within industrial establishments to which so
little attention is given as proper lighting and illumination.
Especially is this the case in many of the factories in the
United States. A prominent investigator, who had exten-
sive opportunities to make observations of industrial es-
tablishments in Europe as well as in America, states: "I
have seen so many mills and other works miserably
lighted, that bad light is the most conspicuous and general
defect of American factory premises."
"My own investigations for the New York State Fac-
tory Commission support this view. In these investigations
it was found that 36.7% of the laundries inspected, 49.2%
of the candy factories, 48.4% of the printing places, 50%
of the chemical establishments, were inadequately lighted.
There was hardly a trade investigated without finding a
large number of inadequately lighted establishments."
Inadequate and defective lighting of industrial build-
ings is not confined to the establishments in New York
State alone. The same conditions prevail in most sections
of the country.
Such conditions as mentioned above are entirely op-
posed to the laws of health, sanitation and efficiency.
Wherever poor lighting conditions prevail, there must be
a corresponding loss of efficiency and output both in qual-
ily and in quantity. American industry is not using nearly
enough daylight and sunlight in its buildings. Every
endeavor should be made to use as much as possible of
daylight for lighting purposes. To obtain this it is of
course necessary that the rays of daylight and sunlight
are permitted to enter the interior of the buildings as
freely as possible, with the important modification that
the direct rays of the sun must be properly diffused to
prevent glare and eyestrain. A glass especially made for
this purpose is known as Factrolite, and is recommended
for the windows of industrial plants. Windows should be
kept clean if the maximum amount of daylight is to pass
through the glass, but the effort will be well repaid by
the benefits secured.
In the presence of poor lighting, we cannot expect
men to work with the same enthusiasm as when a well
lighted working place has been provided. The physical
surroundings have a deep effect upon the sentiments of
the employes, and where bad working conditions are al-
lowed to prevail, there is invariably a lessening of morale
and satisfaction created thereby. Neglecting to utilize
what nature has so bounteously provided, daylight, and
which is so essential toward industrial efficiency, we have
an instance of wastefulness, but now that the importance
of good lighting is becoming recognized, undoubtedly more
attention will be given by progressive industrial employ-
ers to furnishing the means which are essential for their
workers to secure and maintain the efficiency, which counts
for so much in the success of any industrial concern in this
competitive age.
If you are interested in the distribution of light
through Factrolite, we will send you a copy of Laboratory

Some Observations on a Trip to Japan
Elmer A- Sperry
The Sperry Gyroscope Company
JAPAN, as she really is, is unknown to a great
many of us. She is so new and advancing so
rapidly that every traveler who comes back tells us
a new story. It was forty-eight years ago that the
Japanese people were finally liberated from serf-
dom, when the government did "100%" of the think-
ing for them. When I was there in October, they
celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the introduc-
tion of the beginnings of modern education and it
was a great celebration. I have seen a great coun-
try and a great people who have progressed so mar-
velously that they long ago passed the point where
there can be any question about their being a great
world power.
My stay in Japan, although all too short, was
crowded full of experiences that were delightful,
interesting, and most instructive. They are too many
to even touch upon, but will be remembered and
treasured always. Japan is so different from Ameri-
ca that I was interested in every detail, and all my
good friends were so extremely generous in their
hospitality that I was completely overwhelmed.
The Japanese Government extended every cour-
tesy and placed facilities at my disposal which en-
abled me to see many things for myself and to. en-
joy experiences not open to all sojourners in that
country. Naturally, I was most deeply impressed
by those phases in their progress which appeal to
the particular line of my work and experience, and
fortunately I believe that these activities lie near
the foundation of true progress in civilization.
In the matter of education, statistics that I have
seen are nothing short of startling. The Japanese
easily lead all of the nations of the world in percent-
age of those of school age who are receiving edu-
cation. This is very impressive and cannot help but
inspire confidence that Japan, which is now a great
world power, will not only become greater as the
years go on, but will have every right to aspire to
true leadership. Their educational work, together
with their industry, in all that these mean broadly,
contribute the largest share, but I feel that a won-
derful as it all is, it is only the beginning.
The Rapid Advancement in Science
The great men of Japan are very liberal towards
uplifting influences and their work is coming on
apace, although their country is young. Twenty-
three years after they were released from serfdom,
the Mikado vastly contracted his household ex-
penses and every official gave 10% of his salary
to the Government toward the first battleship to be
ordered from England—a little 13,000 ton ship,
which drew heavily on their resources, but note, the
startling thing that happened was that within seven
years they were building their own battleships, the
first of 15,000 tons, and they made practically every-
thing. I was taken through two of the largest dock-
yards they have, one of them four times as large
as any navy yard in this country, where they take
in Swedish pigiron at one end of the place (only it
happens to be the middle) and put out 33.000 ton
battleships at the other end, with enormous 16-inch
guns. Turrets, armor plate, turbines, gear drives
and all are made on the ground.

In engineering and scientific activities, Japan is
without question going forward with leaps and
bounds. Their tools, equipment, and machinery in
many branches of these activities are the finest ob-
tainable. They are not being handled with as great
speed in some instances, possibly, as in our country,
but with caution and excellent understanding. Their
principles are sound, and the product, especially in
any line in which they have had some experience,
is of the best.
There are no engineers the world over who are
I am very glad to report that they were very cordial-
ly received and with every indication of the finest
cooperation and fellowship. In each case, I was
the bearer of important messages of acknowledge-
ment back to America.
There is something that I cannot explain about
the engineers in Japan, except to tell you that they
have no traditions, precedents or ruts, and need not
stop to unlearn a lot of things. Their minds are
free to go straight to the mark. This is certainly
one explanation I have for what I saw.

Beautiful Fujiyama
more studious, devoted, or, I believe, more enthusi-
astic in their work. This I say from quite intimate
contact with two very important classes in Japan—
the Mechanical Engineers and the Naval Architects.
Each of these branches has a society which was
formed just twenty-five years ago, and I went to
Japan to aid them in the celebration of the auspi-
cious event of their anniversary. It was certainly
a very unusual honor that thus came to me, bearing
greetings and congratulations to these societies, be-
ing a member, as I am, of the corresponding soci-
eties in America, and having been made an Honor-
ary Vice-President of one, the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers, for the purpose. The idea
was taken up very enthusiastically by our engineers,
so I had the pleasure of participating with others
in conveying greetings to the two important Japan-
ese bodies over the great seal of our societies here.
In Washington, we have a great model basin in
which a ship is taken in model form and towed from
end to end under many conditions and the most ac-
curate investigation. These items are all studied
before the large ship is made. Michigan, your alma
mater, is the proud possessor of a second one, so we
have two such model basins in this country. In
Japan they have four and in England they have six.
There are fifteen in the world, so you see Japan has
a goodly share.
We have in our Navy Yard here in New York, the
largest horizontal mill, I believe, in this country, 36
feet in diameter. They have a still larger one In
Japan. You can get a 13 foot forging in America, a
15 foot one in England, but for a larger one you must
go to Japan, as they have a still larger press there. The
Japanese built this great forging press themselves

and the work I saw being done on this press was of
the very best.
Their locomotives all over the realm are the most
modern we know how to make in America. In
America, we have locomotives with five kinds or
generations of valve gear, but in Japan we see only
the latest. They have adopted the very latest in
almost every line and have nothing else. We hear
it said that the Japanese come to our country and
take away many things. It would be much more to
the point to say that they reject fifty things to one
they may select.

The Spirit of the Worker
The Japanese are going on with leaps because
they do not have some of the problems that Ameri-
ca has. The problems that we have will probably
slow up our rapid advance. The curve of progress
is easily twice as steep as ours. We are facing prob-
lems that are making us go slowly because of our
nearness to Europe, whereas the Japanese have no
immigration problems. We used to pride ourselves
on our heterogeneous make-up, but, of course, the
heterogeneous factor can go too far. Many Europe-
ans come over here and try to plant their notions
in American institutions, where they do not fit,
and we have to lay down the tools of progress to

catch them and teach them that they cannot ruin
America. I never saw such team work as you find
in Japan. They actually sing together when they
work, which aids in unanimity of purpose and team
work. The secret is that they are all brothers, all
down along the line, and there is no one that any-
one has suspicions about not keeping up his end.
Japan is a nation of workers; there arc no idlers
to be found. Industry and intense activity are the
rule. In Japan a man is estimated by his work and
what he produces. The workers are loyal and cheer-
ful, no matter in what walk of life. When you go
down a city street it almost seems that you run the
automobile by two horns instead of petrol. Both

of the horns try to clear the way. Ahead there will
be a young man struggling with a load that four
people ought to be taking care of, for instance, a
great telegraph pole with the large end 18 inches in
diameter, 50 feet long. You will see him way down

Smh.es
at the other end of the pole with a strap over his
shoulder, struggling along with the pole balanced
exactly on its center of gravity. Finally he turns out
and lets you pass, put to all sorts of inconvenience. If
this were in America, you would be "bawled out" nine
cases out of ten, but when you get up to this man he
turns up with a smile and says, "We got past each other
all right, didn't we?"—a line smile and a splendid
spirit.
I have the old-fashioned idea that industry is the
price and if you are willing to pay the price, namely,
work, you will surely get the goods. Nature never
cheats you. Nothing will be able to stop this won-
derful people with all their enormous industry and
progress. Overshadowing all, they have national
spirit and patriotism hardly equalled, or even ap-
proached, in my judgment, by any nation of the
world, and as the reverse is unfortunately true just
now on the continent, this, I believe, is making for
true leadership in the Orient. Being a great nation
of workers and having no end of solidarity, the Jap-
anese are going forward irresistibly.
I remember, when 13 or 14 years old, reading in
my b'g geography that the Japanese people were
"altruistic," and the teacher explained what it
meant. That was early in the '70's, when our Com-
modore Perry was almost the only one who had
been there, and the very trait that he discovered is
still possessed by these wonderful people. It is a
great national heritage. They are courteous and
self-depreciating in the extreme, exceedingly mod-
est, and their courtesy comes from the heart. Every-
thing in Japan is orderly, self-restrained and digni-
fied, with great courtesy on every hand.
Another observation of no little significance is
that during an extended sojourn in Japan, one sel-
dom encounters an inscrutable face or a face that one
cannot understand and be in sympathy with. One
finds that in any walk of life the people are thought-
ful, responsive and well oriented. They often feel
what one means although one cannot talk their lan-
guage. But I don't think I could possibly have un-
derstood the faces and people I saw, had I not gone
away from Tokyo and encountered the mountains.
We have all heard about beautiful Fujiyama, and
half of its beauty has never been told us, but I did
not know that 19/20 of the entire surface of Japan
was covered with cragged, cruel mountains. These
inountains explain Japan as no other one thing does.
The vigor of the ceaseless effort to conquer these
barriers has wrought marvels throughout the land
and reacted strongly upon the people themselves,—
in fact, has been carried on to heights that have com-
pelled world recognition. In patient hands, some of
these rock-bound fastnesses have become the back-
ground to extreme beauty, while their challenge ha?
developed great hardihood in these gentle and cour-
teous people, coupled with a dauntless spirit—-the
soul of their dual charm.
One word about the children of Japan. It is
Julian Street who says that Japan is a Kingdom of
Children. Every child, without exception, seems
also to be a happy child. They are forever smiling.
You almost step on a group engaged in active and
boisterous play, but instead to taking offense at the
interruption, as would be likely with American chil-

A Big Load
dren, they all look up and smile as much as to say
that they were not at all disturbed,—'twas only a
part of the fun. Everywhere you see the fathers
after work hours, playing with their children in the
parks and elsewhere. The children are very court-
eous to their parents. In traveling on the train you

Public interest in the high building has been
greatly stimulated by the Tribune Building Compe-
tition. Like the modern battleship, the skyscraper, now
a commonplace structure of our large cities, has had a
rapid development. The early ones were ten to twelve
stories in height, reaching their maximum when the
solid masonry walls came to occupy too large a propor-
tion of the lower floor areas. With the development of
steel came the skeleton construction by means of which
the walls were supported at each story by the steel
frame, the masonry serving merely as an enclosure
pierced by windows. On the ground floor, the masonry
was reduced to a protective and decorative covering for
the steel columns; such covering is required by build-
ing laws, since buckling under intense heat would in-
volve the collapse of the entire structure. Parallel
developments with the steel frame were fire-proofing
methods and materials, the elevator and other mechan-
ical and electric devices, which were absorbed into the
ever increasingly upward soaring structures.
The skyscraper admirably illustrates the unrestrained
individualism which has so greatly hampered the prop-
er development of our cities. Many of these buildings
rob others of light and air and lower their rental value
while increasing their taxes. Not until many city
blocks had been solidly built up of high buildings
reaching beyond the "fly and dust line," the lower stor-
ies darkened and streets seriously congested, did build-
ing promoters become amenable to reason and agree
to building regulations and zoning in order to protect
their future building projects. Such regulations have
been upheld by the courts and should be studied and
applied by all live communities.
Great ingenuity has been shown by architects in
making plans for lots of varying size and shape so as
to attract desirable tenants through good equipment,
well arranged corridors, offices and exterior lighting.
The exterior design from the very outset received
careful study. Owing to the large sums represented
by ground and construction cost, speed in the produc-
tion of plans and in the construction of buildings be-
came an important factor and has influenced design.
The tremendous pressure of present day business and
production and the completeness of its building organ-
ization appears in the springing upward of riveted
steel frames at the rate of a story a day, with masonry
or terra cotta enclosing walls often going forward si-
multaneously on several floor levels.
The Greek Doric temple and the Gothic cathedral,
the two most consummate creations of architecture,
and presenting an opportunity no greater than the sky-
scraper, both came at the end of a long evolution dur-
ing periods when there was ample time for design and
construction. There was a well-established architec-
tural tradition in which emotion, form, and structural
system fused, the style being a natural result. Our
complex of races and associations, the marked eco-
nomic bent of our development, and the uncertainty as
to what is most representative or expressive of us has
brought about our hectic mixture of styles, the funda-
mental conditions for a single national embodiment not
being existent.
The architecture of the colonies, the classical and
Gothic revivals, the efforts of Richardson and his fol-
lowers to adapt the Romanesque to American require-
ments, and the Renaissance movement—all these have
produced works of considerable merit, but the knowl-
edge thus gained has not proved fully equal to the task
of the high building.
The Advent of Steel Construction
Each historical style has rather definite associations,
like the Romanesque and Gothic with certain human
conditions which brought medieval ecclesiastical archi-
tecture into being. The "styles" represent a self-
sufficient masonry construction, while steel construc-
tion logically reduced masonry to a mere enclosing or
covering function. With the advent of the steel frame
many designers continued to treat masonry hung on
steel frames much as when it was self-supporting,
while others, led by Louis H. Sullivan, of Chicago, put
forward the theory of function and form and insisted
that the protected steel structural system l)e treated on
its merits rather than imitatively. The first or tradi-
tionalistic group has continued to use or adapt historical
form, while fhe second or progressive group has sought
to derive the enclosing form from structure and to
solve the dualism of rational hidden structure and
expressive enclosing form in another material with its
own practical and artistic implications.
The announcement of the Tribune competition found
architecture of every conceivable type in our large cen-
ters. In New York the graceful terra-cotta-covered,
steel-framed "Gothic" Woolworth Building looks down
on the old New York World Building with its metal
Renaissance dome, and on the clumsy mansard-roofed
Postoffice; nearby stands a bank with a colossal Order

and Mangin's lovely City Hall. Just beyond is the St.
Paul Building, on which a series superposed pilasters,
one to every two stories, mounts to the top. Not far
away are Gothic and Renaissance churches, Adam
hotels, the Madison Square variante of the Giralda
Tower, about which stream automobiles which show
progress in design in that they no longer resemble the
old buggy. There are chateaux on Riverside Drive,
French and Italian palaces and clubs on Fifth Avenue,
and apartment houses in every and no style. All these
show the experimental stages through which we have
passed in trying to find ourselves in the works of
others.
The camera and the illustrated book, combined with
foreign travel and study, have helped to create a love
of the fine old types, and our seizing upon the form
instead of profiting by the principle has proved a pit-
fall in the development of forms appropriate to the
new construction.
Foreign criticism of American architecture ranges
from high and moderate praise to the statement that
it will presently not be necessary for us to go abroad,
since all the important European structures will have
been reproduced here. Dr. Coue was tremendously
impressed by our architecture and is duly hopeful
regarding it! Europeans are greatly amused at our
quotational design, finding domes and temple-like units
sprayed about our commercial structures. However,
when controlling economic conditions are such as to
compel the design of colossal buildings in a few weeks
or months, it is obvious that the creative process is apt
to turn into one of adaptation. So many problems have
to be reconciled in some of these tremendous structures
that the problem of form has been often considered as
secondary, with the consequence that the artistic result
falls below the building's practical adaptation to use.
A balance of the two would make sound architecture.
The adaptation of suggestive past motifs and reason-
ing from precedent have received more emphasis than
the direct attack a new problem demands.
New Era in Architecture
There is a growing body of architects who see the
real goal and are slowly laying the foundation needed.
Some of the better architecturally designed industrial
buildings are truer as modern design than many of
the pseudo-monumental structures whose forms belie
their time and place and structural method. And these
truly creative designers will presently receive the rec-
ognition due them. We accept the new poetry and the
new music, as we have accepted impressionistic paint-
ing, and likewise new forms in architecture must take
their proper place after undergoing the refining process
of repeated study and use.
While the Tribune competition found architectural
opinion at variance as to what is best in high building
design form, it profited by the effects of a law in New
York as to heights and set-backs which during the last
few years has served to break up the monotonous
cubical masses of the preceding maximum cubical con-
tent of high structures, rendering the design problem
more difficult and fascinating and the results more pic-
turesque, and at the same time making for better con-
ditions of light and air in the canyon-like streets.
It is evident from the Tribune competition program
that there was a sincere desire for the most beautiful
design obtainable. The entire architectural world was
invited to participate and large prizes were offered.
Moreover, the architect receiving the first prize of
$50,000 was to erect the structure. Ten architects were
invited to compete, each receiving $2,000 as retainers.
Over two hundred architects participated, at an esti-
mated cost to the competitors of nearly one-half mil-
lion dollars. The site, 100 by 139 feet, is one of the
most important in Chicago. Up to a height of 260
feet this entire area could be used for office purposes;
beyond this, to a height of 400 feet, an area limited to
3,600 square feet could be used, but not for rental
space. With simple plan and structural requirements,
the real task was to design a building which would dis-
tinguish itself among adjoining office buildings of equal
height; there was also the specific problem of compo-
sition, of uniting the tower-like unit at the top with the
solid block below, and of modeling these masses.
Some of the competitors adopted unusual expedients
to differentiate the building from the ordinary com-
mercial structure. Gables and turrets were used to
build back from the main rectangular mass to the upper
square, polygonal, circular, or elliptical element. While
a Pisan would be surprised to find the famous leaning
tower standing erect in Chicago, the free-standing
arcades inspired by that tower give one design a dis-
tinctive and uncommercial character. Giotto would be
amazed to see his Florentine campanile vibrant with
printing presses and a wireless which can reach no fur-
ther than the spirit of the beautiful original. St.
Sophia stood at the top of one of the designs, a neat
little Roman temple on another. Some proposed to
house the modern newspaper in a cathedral tower, with
pinnacles, flying buttresses, traceried windows, carved
canopies, and sculptured figures. Some very skillful
and picturesque designs employed these forms of ques-
tionable fitness, some of them having, however, a con-
sistent lightness of scale appropriate for a structural
steel skeleton.
Some of the designers assumed that they need not
express the structural frame and treated the enclosing
walls as of ordinary masonry or as a decorative skin

When such a design terminated in a dome or belfry

RIZONA is known best in irrigation matters by
"its Salt River Valley Project, which is irri-
gated by waters impounded by the Roosevelt dam.
There are several other projects of lesser import-
ance but all combined would have less area than

as much land as the low water flow will permit.
times. This loss is easily measured in small flows,
and is a contingent study on groundwater problems.
The term of average depth to water can be applied
only to small areas since the topographic and geo-
logic conditions are variable, causing the water plane
to be held up in some places and again to lie at great
depths at others. In several instances, without any
change in the slope of the valley floor, the depth to

Since the river flows, in the arid southwest, are of
the flashy flood type such that three-fourths the
runoff occurs in a few weeks, it may readily be seen
that irrigation is very much limited without storage.
On many rivers, storage may not be economically
feasible or no storage sites may exist. When the
low water flow is exhausted, there still remains the
alternative—pumping from the underground waters.
The source of these underground waters is de-
rived from the loss by percolation downward from
the gravel beds of washes and rivers during flood
water may vary from 40 feet to 150 feet in a distance
of one mile. This condition may arise where the
valley is narrowed by mountain spurs from the sides
or through the proximity of bad rock below.
Of course those areas, under which the water ex-
ists at moderate depths, are the most valuable for
development. The depth from which the water can
he raised profitably depends almost entirely upon
the type of farming practiced and the nature of the
crop raised. It is usually considered that general
farming can exist only if the depth to water is less

than 40 feet, while the more valuable crops such as
citrus fruit, grapes, lettuce, canteloupes, etc., will
provide a sufficiently higher return to warrant pump-
ing from greater depths. While there are several
instances of pumping waters from a depth of 100

feet, it is safe to say that 90 percent of pumping in
Arizona is done from waters lying at a depth of 50
feet or less.

desirable grasses and from disease that may affect
stock. lie can have water at any time he wishes
it while the other man must await his turn. How-
ever, a breakdown of machinery may be a serious
inconvenience to the pumper and his capital invest-
ment and operating costs are usually greater.
Pumping may be and is combined with gravity
systems to augment the low water flow. It is also
practiced as a means of preventing the waterlogging
of irrigated lands and the water so pumped, if of
good quality, is added to the gravity supply. There
are approximately 55,000 acres of land irrigated in
Arizona dependent upon pumping from the under-
ground waters. Two thirds of this area is comprised
of projects in which the water is dispatched to the
land as in a gravity system. These projects are of
three sorts: those privately operated, irrigation dis-
tricts, and power districts. The last two are incor-
porated communities organized under legislative
acts.
Concerning the Supply
Wells are of two main types, dug or drilled, and
sometimes they are a combination of the two. Both
types must be deep nough and must contain suffic-
ient openings for the admission of water to meet
the demands imposed upon them.
Many dug wells are simply timbered down to the
water surface. That part below the water is usual-
ly a large sized, perforated, iron pipe driven down
as far as practicable by hand methods and the ma-
terial removed from the inside. Another type of duj^
well is the reinforced concrete caisson. By this
method, as material is removed from under the
shoe, the concrete curb sinks by reason of its weight.
The bottom part of the caisson contains removable
plugs which are pulled when it reaches its final
position. All the water must enter the bottom dur-
ing the sinking operation and is removed by a pump.
When the pump can no longer keep the water down
to a working depth, operations cease. Dug wells
for irrigation purposes arc only successful when
good water-bearing material exists near the water
level.
In Arizona, as a general rule, wells are drilled
with drop-tools. A few wells have been put down
by the rotary method and in certain artesian dis-
tricts where the overlying materials are principalis

clays or silt, a process of wash-boring is used. Stan-
dard drop-tool rigs may use a bit in localities
where the formations are very hard or cemented.
Usually, however, a bucket or, in well drilling ver-

nacular, a "mud scow" is used alone. This bucket
varies from the sand bucket only in weight and in
the heavy shoe it carries. One of these is shown
in Fig. 3 lying beside the discharge pipe from the
well.
Drilled wells for irrigation range in size from 10
inches in diameter to 26 inches, the most common
sizes being 16 and 18 inches. The casing used is of
two types, screwed casing, and inserted or Cali-
fornia stove-pipe. The former is used in many dif-
ferent weights and is seldom over 12 inches in dia-
meter. The latter is designated by the gauge of
the rolled metal. It is a vertically riveted pipe com-
ing in lengths of from two to four feet, the alternate
sections fitting inside and outside the other and
breaking joints in the middle. Screw pipe is forced
down by pounding while stove pipe casing is forced
down either by pounding of by powerful hydraulic
jacks. If the well is to be a deep one, the casing
often becomes fast in the hole and the well must be
completed by putting a smaller casing down inside
the other. Frequently a large sized casing is put
down only to receive the pump and the well is com-
pleted with smaller sized casing. This applies only
to the turbine type of pump installation.
It is not unusual to drill a battery of wells which
are connected by a common suction pipe to a single
pump. One instance of an installation of this char-
acter is in the Salt River Valley where n feet per
second are pumped from a battery of 12 wells by
one pump driven by a 150 horsepower gas engine.
The depth of wells depends upon the water-bear-
ing quality of the materials encountered and upon
the proposed demand. For the most part, wells are
drilled in the unconsolidated gravels in valleys or
along stream courses. These wells are the best yield-
ers of water and do not have to go so deeply into
the gravels as into the older, tighter or cemented
formations in order to obtan the same yield. Drilled
wells enter the water-bearing depths from 50 to
400 feet, a fair average being about 150 feet.
Fig. 2 illustrates the sort of openings made in
well casing. Casing A shows the holes made by
the Mills knife, one is made at a time by pulling on
a cable. Casing "B" is perforated by a ripper which
cuts a long slot. Casing "C" is perforated by a four-
way Star perforator. Four toothed-wheels are driv-
en down by pounding, cutting four rows of holes at
one operation.
Different Types of Pumps
Nearly all types of pumps are represented in lift-
ing water for irrigation and are listed in the order
of their importance of use: turbine, horizontal cen-
trifugal, vertical centrifugal, single and double act-
ing plunger, propeller, rotary, and air lift.
The turbine is the development of the centrifugal
pump produced to gain high capacity in small com-
pass. The smallest size will fit into a 12-inch casing
and the largest size is 24 inches. The capacity may
range from 400 to 4,000 gallons per minute. The
impellor of this pump is very similar to that of the
ordinary centrifugal pump, but the water, on leav-
ing the periphery, is immediately conducted up-
wards by fixed vanes, thereby effecting a reduc-

tion in total diameter of the pump. The impellors
are carried on a long shaft reaching to the ground
surface inside the discharge pipe and supported by
special bearings running in oil. The discharge pipe
is fastened to the pump head and supports the
pump shell. An efficiency of 75 percent has been
attained in the larger sizes of this pump. Fig. 3
shows an elctrically driven turbine discharging 2,200
gallons per minute against a 65-foot head. The
discharge is measured through the orifice in the
manner shown by obtaining the static head a few
feet back of the plane of the orifice. The tremen-
dous advantage of the turbine pump lies in the
possibility of lowering the water in the well to any
depth. This lowering of the water surface upon
pumping, is called the draw-down and if known iu
advance the turbine can be designed to operate with
little or no suction head.

The horizontal centrifugal pump requires a pit for
its installation and if the prime mover is at the
ground surface, then its use is limited to a ground-
water depth of about 30 feet. A belt is required
and must be given sufficient slant to cling to the
driven pulley without undue initial tension. The
capacity of the pump is limited by the drawdown in
the well since the suction head must not be ex-
ceeded. If an electric motor is used as a drive, the
pump may be placed many feet below the ground
surface. The University of Arizona campus is
supplied with tits domestic and irrigation water by
two such installations, 80 feet below the ground
surface.
The vertical centrifugal pump requires a pit and
is hung on a frame which is supported at the ground
surface. A long shaft supported at intervals by the
frame extends to the top. This pump is used when
the groundwater is at a depth greater than 30 feet,
but seldom is it used at depths exceeding 70 feet.
Various types of rotary pumps have been used
but have not been found satisfactory under irriga-
tion conditions. Propeller pumps are represented
by several makes. This type has propellers sta-
tioned along the shaft at definite intervals which
boost the water along the discharge column. This
particular type can be used in a smaller sized well
than the turbine of equal capacity. The air lift, be-
cause of its general inefficiency, is very little used.
Its principal use is in wells too small for any but a
low capacity pump. Plunger pumps, when double
acting, give good efficiencies when pumping at high
lifts. They are usually expensive, are of low capa-
city, and cannot handle gritty water.
Cheaper Power Necessary
The first pumps used in irrigation were driven
by steam engines using mesquite wood for fuel.
When this fuel became exhausted in the vicinity of
the pumping plants, they were forced to shut down.
The internal combustion engine solved the fuel
problem and in its present state of development is a
highly satisfactory source of power. At first, gaso-
line engines were used, but the price of gasoline
soon became prohibitive when the automobile came
into use. These engines were remodeled then to
burn distillate and soon engines burning kerosene
and heavier oils were developed. The engine now
in general use for irrigation work is of the 4-cycle,
electric ignition type burning gas oil of from 370
to 400 Baume gravity. These engines are made as
large as 80 horsepower in one cylinder.
Engines dependent upon a preheated element for
ignition are of diverse types and makes and are
found in all pumping communities. They burn
lower grades of fuel oil, usually of about 270 Baume
gravity, and some show good fuel economies. True
Diesels are not much used for irrigation but several
makes approaching the Diesel type have found fa-
vor. Because of the heat produced and to simplify
construction, they are made in small cylinder units
of about 25 horsepower. Numbers of these units
are grouped together to provide the required
amount of power.
The electric motor, because of its reliability, com-
pactness, and steady flow of power, is the ideal drive
for pumps. The motor may be directly connected
to the pump, either vertically or horizontally, and
thus eliminate the belt loss in engine drives.
Expansion of pump irrigation will depend upon
the development of a cheap source of power—hydro-
electric, probably. Optimistic views prevail now in
the state on the development of power in the Colo-
radio river and should cheap power be thus obtained,
then pumping would receive a tremendous boost.
As conditions now exist as to the price of power and
farm products, the pump irrigationist is only mark-
ing time.
The University of Michigan Student Chapter of the
American Society of Civil Engineers
For a long time it has !,een felt that here was some
form of a society or organization which would be of
particular interest to the upper classmen of the civil
engineering department. There are many things
which come up in the class room or elsewhere that are
very interesting but there never seems to be an oppor-
tune time to discuss them.
There is a society whose purpose is to foster such
discussions and to bring about new matters for inves-
tigation. This organization is the American Society
of Civil Engineers which has in the last two years al-
lowed the organization of student chapters at the dif-
ferent universities. To date there have been establish-
ed fifty-three such chapters.
Recognizing the need and seeing, in the organization
of a student chapter of the Am. Soc. C. E., the solu-
tion of the problem, several of the members of the
faculty selected a body of twenty senior civils and
placed the proposition of the organization of a chap-
ter before them. The body of students effected an or-
ganization and have secured a charter from the parent
society.
The purposes of the society are to professionally
improve its members and to encourage intercourse
with men of practical science. The membership of
the society is restricted to members of the junior and
senior classes who have the requisite scholastic stand-
ing and who are interested in the practical application
of their technical training.
The officers of the society for the remainder of the
academic year are: E. J. Giffels, President; P. C.
Rurg, Vice-President; J. A. Fisher, Secretary; L. C.
Davis, Treasurer.


As Related to the System of Modern Chemistry
William G. Smeaton
Associate Professor of Chemistry
It is probable that chemistry is the oldest experi-
mental science. Evidences of its applications to arts
and industries are found everywhere amidst the re-
mains of earlier civilizations that have been unearthed
by archaeologists and explorers. Amongst the Su-
merians from the valley of the Euphrates and in other
localities, about which recent discoveries have given
us some knowledge, its applications had reached a
remarkable stage of development even fifty cen-
turies before the beginning of the Christian era.
But one of its phases, that which pertains to gases,
is of very much later origin. The term "gas" was
not devised until early in the seventeenth century.
Although the ancients had come in contact with
different representatives of the gaseous condition of
matter and they comprehended to a slight extent
certain of their properties and functions, still they
had no real knowledge of gases. The term "air"
was representative generally of the gaseous condi-
tion. The ancients knew that air was necessary to
combustion and they showed ingenuity in supply-
ing suitable air-draughts that could be regulated,
for furnaces used in ceramic and metallurgical pro-
cesses and for heating apparatus used in distilling
operations by pharmacists and others. In the eighth
century directions for calcining, by which base met-
als are converted to oxides, recommended heating
the metals in shallow open vessels. Not until the
thirteenth century did it dawn upon metal workers
that the drossing or partial calcination of molten al-
loys used for castings could be prevented by keep-
ing the melts out of contact with air. The first flux
used for this purpose consisted of molten glass.
Former Ideas and Conception of Gases
Early writers on science, especially Pliny, describ
ed airs having striking properties, which were pe-
culiar to certain districts. Also laboratory workers
in chemistry often observed peculiar airs arising
from their alembics and retorts. They were de-
scribed as inflammable airs, choke airs, sulphurous
airs, and the like, but the concept that they might
be different material substances had not dawned.
At the beginning of the Christian era only one ob-
server had conceived the idea that air is ponderable.
This was the Roman architect, Vitruvius, a friend of
Julius Caesar, who expressed a relatively clear view
of air pressure which he elaborated to explain the
action of water pumps. The fact that a calx al-
ways weighs more than the metal from which it is
produced, was noted repeatedly and during the mid-
dle ages tabulations of the gain in weight shown on
converting different metals into their calces became
fairly common. But none of these earlier observers
had conceived the idea that air is in any way re-
sponsible for this weight increase. The seventeenth
century has brought some very noteworthy contri-
butions to the history of pneumatics. Early in the
century the Belgian chemist, J. B. van Helmont, de-
rived the new word "gas" from "Geist" or spirit
and conceived a distinction between this new term
and the older word "vapor." Gas represents an air-
like substance, not easily condensible to a liquid,
and corresponds to our concept of permanent gas,
while vapor is used for material like steam, that is
condensible easily to liquid. Naturally he had dis-
covered a gas and this is the most important item
contributed by him. Since he did not have a con-
venient method to isolate and handle gases his study
was necessarily incomplete and, as would be expect-
ed of any pioneer research, repetitions and exten-
sions of the work had to be made before its authen-
ticity was established. Since the new substance was
prepared first from wood he called it "gas sylvestre."
He showed that it is produced also in the process
of fermentation and likewise by interaction between
limestone and an acid. Its natural occurrence in
certain mineral waters, in the air of the stomach
and in the air of certain caverns was noted. He
demonstrated its relative heaviness and its property
to asphyxiate animals and to extinguish a lighted
taper. The curious effects observed in the famous
"grotto del canis" he attributed to this gas, which
remains close to the floor because of its heaviness
and produces partial aphyxiation of the dogs that
are trained to cross the cavern.
More Practical Methods Disclosed
The French physician, Jean Rey, asserted in 1630
that the increase of weight observed on calcining
tin and lead is due to an absorption of air, but he
did not have the means to demonstrate the accuracy
of the statement since it had not been shown that
air has weight. The proof that air is ponderable
(15)

was given by the Italian physicist, Torricelli, in
1643. His explanation of the vacuity above the
mercury column of the barometer tube suggested a
means to obtain a vacuum in a convenient container
and provided a method to isolate gaseous substances
that made possible the observation of their proper-
ties. Additional facilities to handle gases were af-
forded through the invention of the mechanical air-
pump in 1654 by Otto von Guericke, the famous
Mayor of Magdeburg. This invention aroused a
great deal of interest throughout the scientific
world. It attracted the attention of Robert Boyle,
who constructed an improved pneumatic engine in
1658 with which he continued the series of classi-
cal investigations on air that already had rendered
his name famous as the discoverer of Boyle's law
about 1650. During the latter part of the century
interest centred chiefly in the problem of determin-
ing the properties of air and particularly its functions
in calcination, combustion and respiration. Besides
the very important fact that air has a constant co-
efficient of volume change with pressure Boyle
showed also that only a part of the air is used for the
above processes, confirming an earlier observation
of van Helmont. It was demonstrated too, that a
mixture of combustible material and niter can be
enflamed in a vacuum under a bell jar if the mixture
is heated by means of a focussing lens. An attempt
to explain this fact by affirming that niter and air
both contain the same material particles which sup-
port combustion, unfortunately did not receive the
recognition it merited. The attention of chemists
was side-tracked upon an erroneous explanation of
combustion and calcination put forth by German
investigators, which held sway through the first
three quarters of the eighteenth century. In the
meantime improvements were made in the methods
of handling gases and several new gases were dis-
covered.
Early Methods of Collecting Gases
Boyle collected a gaseous substance such as that
produced through interaction of a meial with an
acid by allowing the gas to displace liquid in the
flask used for the reaction. This was effected by
inverting the flask over water after it had been
charged with the reacting mixture. To the clergy-
man, Stephen Hales, who is noted for his botanical
investigations, is due the device to collect a gas in
a separate receiver. He utilized a retort for the
generating apparatus and dipped the neck of the re-
tort under water below the mouth of the inverted
receiver, which was filled with water. In his "Vege-
table Staticks," issued in 1727, Hales has published
a number of quantitative determinations of the gas-
eous products obtained from different distillations.
Unfortunately he regarded them all as modifications
of air, otherwise he would receive credit for the dis-
covery of oxygen since he had distilled red lead and
undoubtedly had obtained pure oxygen from it. Ob-
viously only those gases which have a slight solu-
bility in water could be collected by the method of
displacing water from a receiver. The Scotch in-
vestigator, Joseph Black, further improved the ap-
paratus for generating and collecting a gas in 1755
by devising a separate delivery tube that could be
attached to the generating flask by means of a cork.
Incidentally he made a classical investigation of
"gas sylvestre," showing that it may be prepared
from limestone by the agency of heat as well as
through the action of an acid. He named the gas
"fixed air," thereby calling attention to the fact that
a comparatively large volume of gas may be locked
up within narrow confines in a solid, from which it
may be eliminated by suitable operations, and also
stimulating greatly an interest in gaseous sub-
stances. Subsequently his eminent English contem-
porary, Henry Cavendish, used collapsible balloons
for assembling gas mixtures to test their explosive
properties. He has contributed the second gas de-
finitely known to us, obtained by interaction of sul-
phuric acid with zinc. This reaction was studied
by Boyle, van Helmont and several earlier investi-
gators, but the identity of the product as a distinct
gaseous species was determined first by Cavendish,
who made an exhaustive study of its properties. To
the English clergyman, philosopher and politician.
Joseph Priestley, is due the final step in the early
development of gasometry. By the invention of
the pneumatic trough with its perforated shelf for
sustaining the receiver he has perfected the method
to collect gases. He has shown also that gase*
which readily form solutions with water may be
collected over mercury and by this means he has
proven the existence of a number of gases which
had escaped observation because they were absorb-
ed by water, for instance hydrogen chloride and sul-
phur dioxide. Particularly noteworthy is his pre-
paration of a gas by heating calx of mercury. The
substance had been distilled from red lead by Hale*
in 1727 and it was prepared also by Priestley in
1771 from niter but a clear description of its re-
markable property to support combustion was not
made until he prepared it from calx of mercury in
1774. C. W. Scheele had devised also several meth-
ods for its preparation independently of Priestley
and it was described by still other investigators
about this time. Scheele had shown that air is a
mixture of two gases, one of wdiich was this new gas.
If we bear in mind the fact that the system of no-
menclature in terms of which arc expressed the facts

A Description of the World's Largest Boiler
Albert L. Clark
Assistant Professor of Engineering Drawing
In 1921 a new boiler unit was added to the Congress
Street heating plant of the Detroit Edison Company.
The installation is of special interest because of its
size, 2,982 horse-power, being, as far as can be ascer-
tained, the largest boiler in existence. The increased
demand for central heating facilities has been clearly
shown by the steady growth of the central heating load
and made necessary the addition of this unit. (The
addition of this unit raised the capacity of the four
heating plants in Detroit belonging to the Detroit E'li-
banks are fifty-two tubes wide in the direction of the
length of the drums.
Because of the closeness of the two center upper
drums no attempt was made to connect them with
water-circulating tubes. Outside circulating pipe bends
of five inches pipe diameter connect the ends of the
drums.
The boiler is designed for a working pressure of one
hundred fifty pounds per square inch gauge. It is
operated at present, however, at pressures varying

son Company to 24,093 horse-power.) This new boiler
is not a radical departure from existing types, but has
many unusual features and refinements in design which
are of more than passing interest.
In general design the new unit is somewhat similar
to the Type \V Stirling boiler. It was made by the
D. Connelly Boiler Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The
four upper drums are of forty-four inches diameter,
and the two lower or mud drums of forty-eight inches
diameter. There is a total of 2,184 tubes. The tube
between one hundred twenty-five and seventy-five
pounds per square inch gauge, depending upon the
demand caused by weather conditions.
Unusually Large Heating Surface Obtained
The floor space occupied and the column spacings
are nearly the same as for the 2,365-horse-power Type
W Stirling boiler. The omission of any super-heater
apparatus (the central heating plants generate only
saturated steam) has made it possible to increase the

amount of tube surface without changing the amount
of space occupied. A further increase in the number
of tubes is made possible by the fact that the drums
are rolled from a single sheet of metal, a design seldom
used in large boilers, principally because of limitations
in manufacturing equipment. The omission of the
second longitudinal seam, which would have been
required had the drums been made up of two sheets,
makes it possible to install tubes in the entire upper
halves of the circumference of the mud drums. The
result is that it has been possible to obtain 29,820
square feet of heating surface in this boiler without a
rated capacity of 1,200 to 1,400 pounds of coal per
retort per hour, giving a total fuel-burning capacity of
33,600 to 39,200 pounds of coal per hour. The two
stokers are driven separately by ten-horse-power direct-
current motors. The clinker rolls or grinders have
separate sources of power, also of the direct-current
motor type, which are entirely independent of the stoker
drive, allowing the speed of the grinders to be adjusted
without reference to the speed of the stoker, a very
desirable operating feature.
Each stoker is driven through a line shaft in the
usual manner. Each section, consisting of two or three

corresponding increase of size of the boiler setting,
auxiliaries, and so forth. The boiler also naturally
becomes more efficient on account of the fact of the
increased heating surface exposed to the hot gases.
The boiler is set with the mud drums fifteen feet
nine inches above the floor, which seems to be a com-
mon height for boilers of this type, giving a height to
the extreme peak of the combustion chamber of approx-
imately thirty-five feet. The volume of the combustion
chamh&gt;er from the tubes to the top of the stoker tuyeres
is 11,440 cubic feet.
The stoker is of the Taylor three-plunger type, with
fourteen retorts on each side of the boiler. It has a
retorts, has a two-speed clutch, enabling the speed of
any section to be reduced to one-half normal when nec-
essary. This feature has proved of considerable oper-
ating value by enabling the firemen to eliminate uneven
spots in the fuel bed as they occur. The speed range
of the stoker, including the additional speed from the
two-speed clutches, is from six to one hundred revolu-
tions per hour.
The floor beneath the stoker is depressed and partly
cut away to allow easy access to the stoker, which is
otherwise difficult when the stoker is set at the usual
height above the boiler-room floor.

H. M. Hansen
Asst. Prof, of Engineering Drawing
Things frequently seem to move in a circle. The
soaring plane, that has been looked upon by many peo-
ple with more or less consternation, was really the fore-
runner of the now common motor driven aeroplane.
It is somewhat like the man who said: "I can not pos-
sibly see how they can wire without a wire—but by
the way, how do they do it with the wire?" Some
may think that the phenomenon of the soaring plane,
which in a few years will be commonplace, may in its
present state of development need some explanation.
In trying to do this I am making extensive use of ar-
ticles written by Professor Wegener in "Illust. Flug
Wochc."
The soaring flight of birds depends on two circum-
stances, namely on their special build and their intuitive
use of certain meteorological conditions favorable to
soaring. It is therefore necessary to try to acquire
the corresponding abilities. The glider must be built
to meet the requirements of soaring which deviate from
those of motor driven flight, and the operator must
learn to judge when the raising air current is strong
cnough to counteract the force of gravity.
Comparison with Aeroplanes
The trend of design in gliders is to lighten all parts,
with especial emphasis given to wing construction. The
glider which has the least load per unit of wing surface
will have the smallest gliding angle and therefore will
need a less forceful raising air current in order to hold
its elevation. The weight per square foot of wing sur-
face of an aeroplane is about 10 pounds, as compared
with from 1.5 to 2.5 for the glider. It will then be ap-
parent that small dimensions are desirable. For ex-
ample, if we consider two similarly built aeroplanes,
one being half the size of the other, the weight of the
smaller will be (yi)3 or one eighth the weight of the
other while its wing area will be only (yi)2 or one
quarter the area of the other. Thus the weight per
unit of wing surface of the smaller will be only one
half of that of the other. In addition to this, all harm
ful resistance must be minimized as far as possible.
This is best done by leaving out all struts, stays and
supports possible and allowing the machine to carry
the wings entirely free. The less the speed for which
the glider is built the more curved must be the shape
of the wing. The best glider has attained a speed of
25 to 30 miles per hour.
The velocity with which birds with outspread wings
fall to the earth is from 1.5 to 5.0 feet per second,
while the corresponding velocity for the glider is 3.0
to 6.5 feet per second and for a common aeroplane
10.0 to 16.0 feet per second. The modern designer
has devoted considerable attention to the possibility
of minimizing this velocity. The older machines which
were hampered with numbers of struts and stays were
found to bz entirely inefficient. The modern designer
goes farther, however, and tries to utilize all the dead
load possible, such as designing all control surfaces to
act as lifting surfaces also. This is particularly im-
portant due to the large size of the control surfaces,
necessitated by the low speed of the glider, just as the
low speed of a barge requires the use of an unusually
large rudder. These large areas also require a careful
consideration of the means for counteracting the tor-
que caused by sudden gusts of wind. Attempts have
been made to replace the ailerons by wing tips which
can be twisted and also to use these wing tips for side
steering by operating them individually. There still
remains the problem of discovering some method of
changing the relative positions of the center of pres-
sure and center of gravity, and thereby omitting the
elevator (the rudder used for changing elevation). The
birds unconsciously obtain that result by stretching
and unfolding their wings. By proper means it should
be possible to change the position of the center of gra-
vity with respect to the wings without appreciably in-
creasing the total weight of the glider, this being one
way of eliminating the elevator. Because of its low
speed and consequent small risk for operator and ma-
chine, the glider is particularly well adapted to this
type of experimentation.
Meteorological Conditions
The meteorological possibilities for soaring depend
on the following two things:
First. The use of slope wind,—the wind which fol-
lows the slope upwards on the exposed side of the hill.
If, for example, the slope of the ground is 1 to 10, a
velocity of the wind of 25 to 30 feet per second at the
top of the hill will give a sufficient lift to counteract
the action of gravity. If in addition the raising air
current has been heated in the valley, as might occur
on the south slope at noon, gliding can be carried out
with even less wind velocity.
Second. When the earth has been heated during
the day by the sun and the air, which has accordingly
reached a higher temperature near the ground than in

the higher altitudes and begins to work its way up-
wards, we shall tind a real air current developing about
thirty feet above the ground. On clear days these ther-
mostatic winds may have quite an appreciable raising
effect.
In cloudy weather we find the raising air current di-
rectly under the clouds, while the colder air sinks
down between them. This will explain how a glider,
forced to leave a raising current, may fly as fast as
possible thru thq downward current and then compen-
sate for the consequent loss in elevation by remaining
as long as possible in the next raising air column. The
slow speed necessary for remaining as long as possible
in the upward air currents is acquired by using the
least possible gliding angle.
By dynamic flight is meant gliding that is accom-
plished by the use of two air strata moving in different
directions.
Gaining Elevation
The kinetic energy of the glider s expressed by the
formula 1/2MV2, in which v means velocity of the
glider thru the air. All surplus velocity above that
needed for gliding can now be transformed into poten-
tial energy in the form of added elevation. This ener-
gy may be expressed by Mgh, where h is the elevation
of the glider and g the acceleration due to gravity. Gain
in elevation occurs, then, when there is a surplus of
velocity above that necessary to sustain flight and loss
of elevation occurs when the velocity is insufficient to
sustain flight. From the law of conservation of energy
we know that the loss in kinetic energy, 1/2MV2, must
just equal the gain in potential energy. Mgh, and vice
versa, or v'J=2gh.
It can be seen from this formula that a gain of ele-
vation obtained by additional velocity will be greater
than the loss of elevation due to a decreased velocity
when the increase and decrease are equal, because the
ratio of elevations varies as the square of the ratio of
the velocities. Assuming a glider to have a velocity
of thirty-five feet per second, an increase of velocity
of Av will give a corresponding addition to elevation
Ah namely
Av=5 10 15 20 25 30 FT/SEC.
Ah,=6 12 20 28 37 47 FT.
For the same decrease in velocity, on the other hand,
we shall have the following loss in elevation:
—Av=5 10 15 20 25 30 ft/sec.
Alv=5 9 13 16 18 19 FT.
To the following changes in velocity:
Av=±5 ±10 ±15 ±20 ±25 ±30 ft/sec.
we have then the corresponding total increases in ele-
vation of
!\\\—Ah.,= I 3 7 12 19 28 FT.
From this it follows that two wind strata must have
a dfference in velocity of at least 15 feet per second
in order that the energy gained will balance the loss
caused by gravity, which as previously stated is from
3.0 to 6.5 FT/sEC Air strata with different velocities
are practically exclusively found close to the ground
and are as a rule caused by friction between the air
and the ground.
Assuming that an efficiently built glider will lose
practically nothing in velocity by passive resistance
and assuming the following typical conditions,
1) a glider, with initial speed required to sustain
flight of 35 feet per second,
2) encounters and flies in the same direction with
an air current of 15 feet per second, thereby ac-
quiring a velocity relative to the earth of 50
feet per second,
3) and then suddenly runs into a dead calm near
the earth, the velocity relative to the earth still
remaining 50 feet per second,
it is evident that if the glider describes a half circle
and encounters the previous air current, this time fly-
ing in the opposite direction, it will have acquired a
velocity relative to this air current of 65 feet per sec-
ond. The tables show that in obtaining this additional
velocity it has gained 47 ft. in elevation. From this,
however, must be subtracted the loss in elevation due
to gravity and the loss in energy due to describing this
half circle in which the slant of the wings produces
considerable passive resistance. This maneuver, never-
theless, which reminds one of the soaring flight of the
birds of prey in the lower air strata where the velocity
of the wind increases rapidly with the elevation, can
be expected to suggest possibilities for continued dy-
namic gliding.
Forestry in Ireland
Some time since the American Forestry Associa-
tion, in its desire to minimize the damage done by
necessary war cutting to the forests of the United
Kingdom, presented some twenty-five million tree
seeds to the British Government. They were re-
ceived by the British Forestry Commission, whose
chairman is General Lord Lovat, in the spring of
1920. The larger portion of these seeds were Doug-
las fir from west of the Cascade Mountains. Two-
thirds of the whole shipment of Douglas fir (about
fifteen million seeds) were sent to Ireland, where
they have been sown in scattered nurseries and will
be used in the creation of small forests on hitherto
unproductive land.
The seeds of Douglas fir seem to be one thing
which can be sent from America to Ireland, via
England, without involving any one in political
complications.

HP HE ENGINEERING COLLEGE of the Univer-
sity has undergone an immense expansion since
its foundation.' In 1922 the present structure was be-
gun and in 1910 an addition was built that could ac-
commodate about 1,200 students. Now, over 2,000
students are using the building as built for approxi-
mately half that number. Some of the departments
have outgrown their original quarters and to make
room for them, the New Engineering Laboratories
were planned.

CHEMICAL ENGINEERING treats of the oper-
ation and control of those important industrial opera-
tions in which chemical processes play a vital part. It
arose as a separate division of engineering with the
development of the chemical industries, just as elec-
trical engineering developed over a generation ago
when electricity became industrially important. In

Construction Between Wings
connection with chemical engineering one thinks first
of those industries which are generally recognized as
chemical; the manufacture of cements; electro-metal-
lurgy ; the destructive distillation of fuels to form gas,
coke and tar; the distillation of j:etroleum; the pro-
cesses of water purification; the refining of fats and
oils and their manufacture into soap, paints, and var-
nish; the manufacture of sugar, paper pulp and pa-
per; the bleaching and dyeing of silk, wool, and cot-
ton. Other fields, often thought of as non-chemical,
involve chemical processes which the Chemical Engi-
neer should operate, such as the heat treatment of
metals, the melting and casting of metals and alloys,
and the combustion of fuels.
The student in chemical engineering studies not only
the chemistry involved in manufacturing processes
and the method of applying it to control quality of pro-
duct, but also the factors to be considered when an
operation is transferred from the laboratory to the
manufacturing scale, the advantages and limitations of
large-scale operations, and the controlling influence of
cost as a factor in all industrial operations. The Chem-
ical Engineer must understand how to modify a pro-
cess to allow proper control on the large scale and
must be able to select special materials for his appara-
tus, develop and design equipment, assemble equipment
to form a plant, or operate the finished plant. His
work is distinct from that of the chemist on the one
hand, and from that of the mechanical engineer on the
other, though he must have a strong background of
bulb chemistry and mechanical engineering. He is,
then, primarily a man who is concerned with the devel-
opment, operation, or equipment of processes.
The application of Chemical Engineering to the in-
dustries involving organic chemistry is of relatively re-
cent development. The manufacture of dyes, medic-
inals and coal tar products stands first in popular
imagination. This is an important and well-developed
field but is inferior in importance and prospects to
those tremendous industries like petroleum, sugar and
leather which are chemical industries although in many
cases conducted as yet on an empiric basis.
THE GENERAL LABORATORIES of Chemical
Engineering occupy a space 112 by 34 feet on the sec-
ond floor and 33 by 34 feet on the third floor of the
North Wing. Provision is made for the following
processes:—
EVAPORATION. The Evaporator Laboratory
occupies a space 26 x 69 feet extendng from the base-
ment thru the first floor. It is to be moved from the
old boiler house where it has occupied an approximate-
ly similar space since 1917. The principal equipment
is a set of evaporators and accessories which are the
gift of the Swenson Evaporator Co. of Chicago. It Is
perhaps the most complete and extensive equipment of
its kind in the country. The evaporators include a
vertical tube, a horizontal tube, and a semi-film unit.
They have a maximum capacity of about 4,000 lbs.
water evaporated per hour in each unit. They are
completely equipped with such accessories as devices
for weighing and controlling feed, removing crystals
and measuring condensate. They have the greatest
possible flexibility to permit thcir adaptation and pro-
cess development.

Fourth Floor—North Wing
DISTILLATION. Facilities for the study of batch
and continuous distillation, and of dephlegmation, are
available. The equipment consists of three batch-stills
and one continuous still, and is so designed as to be
suitable for investgations of the fundamental princi-
ples of fractional distillation and fractional condensa-
tion.

GAS ABSORPTION. There is an absorption col-
umn which can be filled with various types of tower
packing.
FILTRATION. The present equipment consists of
a 24" washing plate-and-frame press, with an assort-
ment of special frames. There is also a De Laval cen-
trifugal clarifier and filter, and a 10" Weston centri-
fuge.

DRYING. At present the laboratory possesses a
spray drier with a capacity of 15 gals, per hour, com-
plete wth cyclone separator, superheater, and other
accessories.
CRYSTALLIZING. For this work there is a stand-
ard 20 ft. single deck Swenson-Walker continuous
crystallizcr; and also a special vertical batch crystal-
lizer.
STIRRING AND MIXING. One of the labora-
tory's tanks is equipped with paddle stirrers and with
devices for studying agitation. Facilities are also avail-
able for the study of propeller stirrers.
Considerable additions will be made to the above list
of equipment when the new building is occupied and
the field available for investigation will be correspond-
ingly widened. In addition to this special equipment,
there is a full complement of storage, reaction, and
weigh tanks, scales, pumps, and other accessories nec-
essary for carrying out complete processes. Soft wat-
er may be obtained from two Zeolite water softeners
and a supply of condensed water nearly as pure as
distilled water is also on hand. Most of the above
special units are interconnected for continuous opera-
tion. Much of the equipment is of such a size that
the results.of investigations are directly applicable to
commercial operations or to the design of full-scale
commercial plants.
METALLURGICAL LABORATORIES. Facili-
ties for heat treating and melting are provided in a
furnace room 25 x 60 feet equipped with standard
electric and gas furnaces. A pyrometric control sys-
tem including automatic regulators is a part of this
equipment. Facilities are provided for electro metal-
lurgical work and experimental electric furnace work
in this room. Power is furnished through three 50
KAY. transformers. Additional facilities for metallur-
gical work are available in the foundry and forge shop
and in the heat treating room of the Engineering
Shops.
For instruction in metallography facilities are pro-
vided in the way of a large grinding and polishing
room, a microscope and camera room, and a well-
equipped dark room. A smaller room fully equipped
wth grinding, polishirg and microscopic equipment,
and special camera and dark rooms, arc available for
graduate: students.
Special testing cijuipmc ;t such as the Brinell Hard-
ness machine. Shore Schroscope, Rockwell Hardness
Tester, Lcwis Upton Toughness machine, Izod Im-
pact and others are available. Provision has been
made for the installation of small rolls and a draw-
ing bench. General physical testing equipment is avail-
able in the Enginering Mechanics Laboratory.
Tn the Pyrometry Laboratory unusual facilities are
provided. This laboratory has desk space sufficient to
accommodate 15 students working at the same time.
The equipment includes several types of millivoltmet-
ers. indicating and recording potentiometers, a trans-
formation 1x&gt;int apparatus, optical and radiation py-
rometers, various types of thermocouples, and ample
facilities for calibrating and checking pyrometric ap-
paratus. The arrangement and equipment of the lab-
oratory are all aimed to supply the student with infor-
mation which will enable him to take charge of the
installation and control of commercial pyrometric and
temperature control systems.
SPECIAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING LAB-
()RAT( )R IKS. In addition to the general laboratories

above mentioned, small laboratories are equipped for
special work as follows:—
The CEMENT LABORATORY is equipped with
a small rotary kiln and other apparatus for burning
Portland cement under controlled conditions and for
testing the properties of the finished cement.
The CERAMIC LABORATORIES, located on the
third floor, consist of a kiln room, preparation room
and laboratory. The kiln room covers about 600
square feet and is equipped with oil fired pottery, high
temperature, and down draft kilns, an air blower and
gas booster for firing with gas, and the necessary py-
rometric equipment. A switchboard is provided for
connections to apparatus for electrical drying and
heating. The Preparation Room includes a dry pan
for fine grinding of shales and hard clays, two mixers,
a pug mill and extruding machine, glass topped tables,
and other equipment used in preparing clays for burn-
ing. The laboratory is supplied with a Fairbanks test-
ing machine, a volumeter, and means for analysing
and testing the raw and burned clay.
The PULP AND PAPER LABORATORY con-
tains small digesters for the manufacture of pulp, a
beater, screen, and bleaching apparatus, and screens
for making paper by hand. .
THE PAINT AND VARNISH LABORATORY
contains facilities for the study of problems connected
with the manufacture of paint and varnish and their
application. In addition equipment for this work is
provided in the general chemical engineering labora-
tory.
THE PETROLEUM AND MOTOR FUELS
LABORATORY has facilities for study and utiliza-
tion of motor fuels and other petroleum products.
These are supplemented by the equipment available in
general chemical engineering laboratory.
THE DYE, TEXTILE, AND LEATHER LAB-
ORATORY has facilities for the study of problems
connected with the dye, textile, and leather industries.
These are supplemented by additional equipment in the
general chemical engineering laboratory.
THE ELECTROCHEMICAL ENGINEERING
LABORATORY provides research facilities for elec-
trochemical work. Equipment for the study of elec-
tro-thermal and high-temperature electrolytic processes
are also available as part of the facilities of the metal-
lurgical laboratories.
THE GAS ENGINEERING LABORATORY
contains furnaces for manufacture of gas on a small
scale and for measuring and testing the finished pro-
duct.
THE GAS AND FUEL LABORATORIES occu-
py three rooms on the fourth floor on the north wing.
They contain apparatus for the routine analysis of flue
gases and coal gas; calorimeters for gas and for solid
fuels, and equipment for testing boiler water and lub-
ricants.
The New Engineering Shops
During the coming summer the equipment of the
Engineering Shops will be moved into the new quar-
ters in the East Engineering Building, and will occu-
py the south wing.
A storage room, twenty-three by sixty feet, has been
provided for in the basement, where materials and
supplies for all shop departments will be kept. This
material will be issued to the various departments
through a stores clerk and will be controlled by a reg-
ular factory form of stores control.
Electric power is used throughout, the machines be-
ing driven in groups rather than individually, in order
to keep the investment in power transmission as low
as possible. Power transmission of the best type will
be installed, standardized as to size and speed for all
laboratories so that maximum flexibility and efficiency
is obtained.
The shop administrative offices and drawing room
are located on the south-west corner of the second
floor. Class-rooms are placed adjacent to each shop
laboratory. Locker-rooms are provided on each floor
with showers on the first and third.
The machine shop, approximately sixty by one hun-
dred thirty feet is located on the first floor and has
been carefully arranged to demonstrate the two types
of machine shop methods, tool-room and production.
Machines of the tool-room type are arranged in group-
to best serve instructional purposes, while a separate
group of machines are arranged to give the student a
perspective of the machine tools and methods used in
the manufacture of an article in quantity. Considera-
ble new equipment in the form of lathes, milling-ma-
chines and special machines for research work, such a?
die-casting, punch press, drop forge hammer, die-
sinking machine, gear generators, etc., are being add-
ed. A well organized tool-room, twenty-five by thirty
feet, serves the machine shop and is controlled by an
attendant. Machines such as grinders for taking care
of the tools and a cut-off saw for issuing stock will be
located in the tool room. An inclosed room which will
contain all of the dry grinding and polishing machines
is located adjacent to the tool room. Boxes are being
provided so that each studenfs tools and work can be
kept in a part of the tool-room while he is not in the
laboratory. Other boxes are arranged for each ma-
chine which contain all tools and accessories needed in


Page 25

operating that machine. These will also be kept in the
tool-room when not needed.
A wood and pattern shop sixty by fifty feet is locat-
ed on the second floor. This shop will be somewhat
smaller than the present wood shop, although facilities
for instructing a large number of students will be
available. Wood storage rooms and pattern storage
rooms are also located on this floor. Two rooms, each
about twenty-five by twenty-five feet, are located on
the second floor, in which research work may be con-
ducted.
The forge shop, sixty by one hundred feet, is locat-
ed on the third floor. New equipment in the form of
forges, electric and gas welders, heat treating and case
hardening furnaces, etc., are being added. The course
in forge shop is being revised so as to supplant to a
great extent manual training by principles, demonstra-
tions and modern practice in the working and heat
treating of steel. The heat treating apparatus will be
complete and will be available for extensive research
work.
The foundry, sixty by one hundred feet, will be on
the fourth floor and is being provided with many new
pieces of equipment, such as a cupola, crucible fur-
nace, core oven, electric furnace, sand blast machine,
etc. A two-ton traveling crane will serve the foundry
floor. All of this equipment will be of the latest de-
sign and will be excellent for instructional purposes
as well as research work in casting metals such as cast
iron, cast steel and the non-ferrous group. A chem-
ical lalxiratory is being installed next to the foundry
in order to control scientifically the product of the
foundry. This combination offers excellent opportuni-
ties for foundry research.
A large elevator is to be placed in the east end of
the wing to serve all of the shop laboratories. The
storage space for the foundry supplies is provided for
in the court, while flasks and other accessories will be
stored on the roof of the building.
NEW TRADITION was inaugurated on March
6, when the Junior Engineers held their first
annual banquet at the Union. The occasion was
one of formality and dignity throughout.
Dean Cooley with his usual wit and humor, spoke
on '"Wanted, a Job." He explained that there are
several types of students in the Engineering Col-
iege, and told how the environment of each would
affect his experience as an Engineer. Following
Dean Cooley, Mr. Theodore Hinchman, '93, of the
firm of Smith, Hinchman and Grylls, enlarged upon
the phrase, "Wanted, an Engineer." Among the
qualifications of the successful engineer which he
enumerated are a broad cultural education, a fun-
damental knowledge of the principals of Economics
as well as thorough Engineering training and exec-
utive ability.
The committee in charge of the banquet deserves
to be complimented for the success of the affair. It
is hoped the succeeding Junior classes will continue
the banquet as an annual function.
The New Aeronautical Laboratory
A strictly modern aeronautical laboratory is being
installed in the basement of the south wing of the
new engineering shops. This laboratory will be
complete with a model shop, drafting room, and
two wind tunnels which will facilitate a more prac-
tical knowledge and increased efficiency for the aer-
onautical engineers.
The larger wind tunnel will resemble the Crocco
Tunnel of Italy and have a variable diameter of 5,
(.. or 8 feet. It is to be built into the concrete and
will be the second largest in America. Wind veloc-
ities from 100 M. P. H. may be obtained by a spe-
cially constructed fan of variable pitch and driven
by an electric motor of 200 II. P. One of the unique
features of this tunnel is that the return ducts are
widened out instead of being of constant cross sec-
tion as in the Crocco Tunnel. This arrangement
will greatly increase the dynamic efficiency of the
tunnel.
The smaller of the two tunnels will be about 1 foot
in diameter and used exclusively to study high
speed phenomena. With a wind velocity of 450 M.
P. H. it can be used for experimenting with aerial
bombs and the calibration of aerial instruments.
An experimental chamber, called an Eiffel's
Chamber, is to be placed directly over the main air
jet two stories high containing two dynometers on
traveling bridges which will permit the setting up
of a new experiment while one is in progress.
Due to the large capacity of this wind tunnel, a
great deal of research work will be done and it will
now be possible to carry out both governmental and
commercial investigation in the aeronautical depart-
ment here.
Engineering College Magazines
Engineering College Magazines, Associated, held
its second annual convention at the University of
Illinois. February 16th and 17th. The representa-
tives of the member magazines assembled on the
morning of the 16th in the Union Building where
all the meetings were held.
Most of the problems relating to the editorial and
business policies of the publications were discussed.
The object of the organization is to develop better
Engineering College magazines through co-opera-
tion in securing articles by prominent men and ad-
vertising of a national rather than local scope.

The meetings were very successful and termin-
ated in a banquet at the Inman Hotel Saturday even-
ing. The 1924 convention will be held at Ames,
Iowa. The first convention was held in Ann Arbor,
a year ago, when the delegates were entertained by
The Technic.
Federated American Engineering Societies
The Federated American Engineering Societies,
organized by members of the large American En-
gineering Societies, has issued its annual bulletin, a
report of the work initiated and supported by the
organization during the past year.
A large number of bills have been presented to
Congress dealing directly or indirectly with the en-
gineering field. The Muscle Shoals project, refor-
estation, chemical dye embargo, patent legislation,
and re-organization of governmental departments
have received considerable impetus from the ef-
forts of the Federated officials.
Numerous investigations have been initiated by
the Council in the hope of bettering industrial con-
ditions. A study was made of the length of shifts
prevailing in industry and an extensive report on
the findings has been published. The Committee
on Elimination of Waste in Industry surveyed six
national industries finding room for much saving
of waste materials, elimination of inefficiency in
processes, and their report has also been published.
The Federation was represented at the Engineer-
ing Congress at Rio de Janeiro last year and was
in a large measure responsible for its success.
Are We to Have Another Engineering Exhibit?
)URING the past few months we have heard con-
siderable talk about engineering exhibits. The
conversation, however, has been composed largely of
questions, and "What is an engineering exhibit?" was
the principal one. Outside of a small group of seniors,
who attempted to put the movement through this spring,
very few students have any definite idea about the
affair. It is because of that fact that The Michigan
Technic wishes to tell you something of the past
exhibits and of the possibilities of an exhibit for next
year.
In the past the students of the Engineering College
have put on three exhibits, the last of which took place
in the year of 1916. At that time it was the intention
of the faculty and the students to hold the event every
two years. However, along came the war, just at a
most inconvenient time, and due ot the abnormal con-
ditions resulting therefrom, the exhibits were tempo-
rarily discontinued.
The three exhibits that have been put on were aston-
ishingly successful. The first one was arranged to last
onlv for Friday afternoon, but such a crowd appeared
upon the scene that it was necessary to run the exhibit
until late Saturday evening. The news of the engi-
neering exhibit spread throughout the state, and when
the next display was opened people came from all parts
of Michigan to sec what the students had to offer.
The newspapers made quite a bit of the affair and
several trade magazines wrote up the exhibits in detail.
The people who swarmed in and out of the building
kept the recording turnstiles clicking noisily until they
had registered an attendance in the neighborhood ot
twenty thousand persons, who all agreed that the
exhibit was a complete success.
Now, the complete success was due to the splendid
cooperation and the enthusiastic work put forth by the
students of the college. The same spirit and enthu-
siasm was typical of all three exhibits, but the models
and stunts were naturally quite different. Each depart-
ment made some one or more things for display. To
illustrate: the civils, for one exhibit, built a miniature
mountain peak in which was located a source of water
supply. The water trickled over the rocks jnto a res-
ervoir formed by the hand-made canyon walls and a
model dam. Below the dam was a miniature power-
house which demonstrated the latest in hydro-electric
power developments. A concrete highway and a rail-
road ran through the valley and afforded an excellent
opportunity to show modern road and bridge con-
struction.
At another time the civils interested in structural
work assembled a model of a modern steel-frame sky-
scraper. The model had been displayed at the Paris
World's Fair and was shipped to the University in
parts. Several people had unsuccessfully attempted to
put the thing together, and finally, in disgust, turned
the jumbled mass of parts over to a few senior civils,
who succeeded, after months of hard work, in assem-
bling the model.
The electricals, at the same time, had an electric rail-
way running around the boiler-house. It received its
power from a generator driven by a gasoline engine.
When the train ran, it carried two persons, and gave
the men a splendid chance to display automatic signal-
ing and safety devices.
The mechanical, marine, and electrical laboratories
ran regular and special tests for the benefit of the vis-
itors. In addition to the tests, many freak stunts were
pulled off which livened up the exhibit. Person after
person tripped over a blast of air that was blown under
high pressure across the bottom of a doorway, while
others, attempting to locate some means of visible sup-
port, became dizzy walking around a rubber ball held
up by a stream of air. The largest sparkling gem in
the world, made from an ordinary light globe and a
unique set of flickering colored lights, attracted large
crowds. These are only a few of the hundreds of

things that made up the engineering exhibits in the
past.
To get the students to think satisfactorily and to
accomplish something worth while, it was necessary to
organize their individual efforts. In the past the organ-
ization has been relatively simple. A chairman was
elected from the senior members of each department.
These men in turn elected a general chairman, who
had charge of the entire exhibit. Under the depart-
ment chairmen were several vice-chairmen who had
charge of the men in the specialized branches of the
departments. The actual work was done by the seniors
and juniors of the departments, assisted by the sopho-
mores and freshmen, and was under the direct super-
vision of the vice-chairmen. The cooperation of the
department branches and of the departments was
obtained through meetings of the vice-chairmen and
of the chairmen as often as was deemed necessary.
The faculty in general acted in an advisory capacity,
but some of the younger men took an extremely active
interest in the exhibits.
At the present time the faculty seems to favor the
re-establishment of the engineering exhibits. All of
the department heads approved of the movement when
they were interviewed. Moreover, several of the
instructors, who were students at the time of one or
more of the exhibits, showed considerable enthusiasm
over the possibility of another exhibit. The special
committee, called together by Dean Cooley to pass
upon the advisability of an engineering exhibit for this
year, strongly favored the re-establishment of the
custom next year, when the opening of the new lab-
oratory building would relieve the crowded condition
of the present building.
Having found that the faculty looks with favor upon
it, the engineering exhibit of 1924 is almost entirely
up to the students of the Engineering College. Are
we going to push the matter or are we going to let it
die after it has been successfully started upon the road
to rejuvenation? The classes of 1914 and 1916 were
not so large as our present classes, and surely they had
no more ability, yet they made a huge success of the
exhibits. Can we do what has been successfully accom-
plished in the past? We surely can. Now is the time
to make our plans and get things started, thereby insur-
ing a bigger, better, and more successful engineering
exhibit than has ever been held before.

Citizens' Military Training Camp
The War Department has announced that the annual
Citizens' Military Training Camp for the states of
Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin will be held this
year at Camp Custer, Michigan, during the month of
August.
This camp is open to all young men who are men-
tally, morally, and physically fit and who desire to
attend. All expenses, including transportation, are
defrayed by the government. In no way does partici-
pation in this camp obligate one to further military
service, although the War Department quite naturally
hopes that many of the men will be inclined to asso-
ciate themselves with the National Guard or Reserve
at some later date. The main object of holding these
summer camps is to stimulate interest in national
defense and to offer to those who desire it a course
in physical and military training which is unquestion-
ably beneficial.
For further information regarding the camp, apply
to the Chief of Staff, Eighty-fifth Division, 500-502
Marquette Building, Detroit, Michigan.
Examination for Commission in the Regular Army
A final examination of candidates for appointment
in the grade of second lieutenant, Regular Army, will
be held during the week commencing June 25, 1923.
There are eighty-five (85) vacancies to be filled.
Applicants who live in the State of Michigan may
submit their applications to the Chief of Staff, Eighty-
fifth Division, or directly to the Commanding General,
Sixth Corps Area, 1819 West Pershing Road, Chicago,
Illinois.
Application forms (No. 88, AGO.) and copies of
Army Regulations 605-5, which govern the examina-
tion, may lie obtained from the Commanding General,
Sixth Corps Area. Full details concerning the exam-
inations are set forth in these regulations, and candi-

dates should familiarize themselves with the provisions
thereof. Special attention is called to the following
provisions of these regulations:
(a) Candidates must be citizens of the United States
and between the ages of 21 and 30 years. At the time
of examination candidates must be in one of the fol-
lowing classes:
(b) A warrant officer or enlisted man of the Regular
Army, having not less than two years' service as such.
(c) A reserve officer or member of the Enlisted
Reserve Corps.
(d) An officer, warrant officer, or enlisted man of
the National Guard.
(e) Graduate of a technical institution approved by
the Secretary of War.
(f) Any citizen of the required age may, upon pass-
ing the preliminary examination, enlist in the Enlisted
Reserve Corps for the purpose of establishing his
eligibility.
Preliminary examinations may be conducted at any
time under provision of Corps Area Commander. This
examination consists of an inquiry into the physical,
moral, and mental qualifications of an applicant to de-
termine whether or not he has the requisite qualifica-
tions to satisfactorily proceed with the final examina-
tion. Such a preliminary examination will avoid incon-
veniences and unnecessary delays and expense to both
the applicant and the government in many cases.
The final examination is held simultaneously
throughout the country and is the same for all candi-
dates. The scope of the mental examination is such
as to insure the Army securing men of the requisite
educational foundations to satisfactorily follow a
career as an army officer. The elementary part of this
examination embraces the subjects of history, gram-
mar, geography, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, arith-
metic, and physics. The advanced part of the exam-
ination consists of a large number of subjects, includ-
ing mathematics, advanced mechanics, surveying, lan-
guages, literature, electricity, chemistry, law, and minor
tactics. Examination is required in but three subjects
of the advanced group to be selected by the candidate.
Employment Continues Favorable
That engineering services continue to demand, with
practically no unemployment in the ranks of profes-
sional engineers, is reported by the employment depart-
ment of the American Association of Engineers. Con-
struction work has not fully opened up, but is continu-
ing at a regular winter diminished rate, with the best
prospects of a wholesome activity this year. The gen-
eral mood of the public on business conditions is veiy
cheerful and there is no apparent loss of confidence.
Recent advances in the cost of materials, particularly
the increase in the cost of steel, may result in a num-
ber of projects being held up. Several big projects in
the central west which would run into a cost of several
millions have already been held up on this account.
There is a possibility that shortages will exist for
lx&gt;th skilled and unskilled labor, which is already
becoming noticeable in industrial establishments. If
the European political and financial stiuations are
ironed out soon, this country will probably experience
a most excellent era of prosperity when coupled with
the present favorable general conditions.. The state
highway programs for the entire country will aggre-
gate this year an expenditure close to three-quarters of
a billion dollars. Very few highway engineers of expe-
rience are available for employment, and it will be
necessary for the highway commissions to engage inex-
perienced men for their staff or obtain young men who
are graduating from universities this year.
The present great demand continues for designing
engineers, including structural, mechanical, and archi-
tectural. This holds true for practically all sections
of the country except some sections in the East. ISos-
ton reports that little engineering activity is in progress
in the northeastern section. Most of the engineers are
employed, but very little outside activity is evident.
New York reports considerable designing work now
being undertaken, with excellent prospects for con-
struction work starting soon after the first of April.
Practically all other sections of the country report a
shortage of professional engineers except a few sec-
tions west of the Mississippi River, where the supply
and demand about balance.

facilities are completely up-to-date and equal to
some of the American standards with which I am
familiar.
I am pleased to learn that the trip of our honor-
able Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Denby, which I be-
lieve is by far the most important trip taken by any
Secretary of the Navy of the United States, gave
him much the same opportunity for observation
in Japan that I enjoyed, and I cannot but believe
that he was impressed by many of the same phases
and noble traits of Japanese character that impress-
ed me, including the entire sincerity of their altru-
ism and charming courtesy. It is a nation of cheer-
ful workers, happy and obedient children and loving
parents, a kingdom that one might almost say is
ruled by beauty and smiles.
I am informed that as a result of the courtesies
received on his visit, Mr. Denby has sent back across
the Pacific to his distinguished hosts a beautiful,
specially prepared memento in the form of a volume
entitled "Peace and Friendship." This has made
the many friends of Japan most happy and the noble
thought that promoted it is certainly inspiring.
EARLY CHEMISTRY OF GASES
(Continued from Page 16)
of modern chemistry, was used first in 1787 after the
classical discoveries of Boyle, P,lack, Cavendish,
Priestley, and Scheele had received a correct interpre-
tation from Lavoisier, the eminent French chemist,
we should see why it is that a relatively large propor-
tion of space in elementary chemistry courses is given
up to the study of gases. The foundations of chem-
istry rest upon knowledge of the gaseous condition.
The principle underlying modern nomenclature is em-
braced in the definition of chemical elements furnished
by Robert Boyle in 1661. Like certain other brilliant
conceptions this one came before the world of science
was readyr for it and acceptance was delayed until the
necessary preparation had been accomplished. In the
meantime during the latter part of the eighteenth cen-
tury a fairly large number of gases were identified
and pneumatic studies claimed a large share of atten-
toin at the time when the reform of chemistry was in
progress. The revival of the ancient Greek atomic
hypothesis by John Dalton in the beginning of the
nineteenth century also directed the thoughts of chem-
ists to a further consideration of gases because of a
controversy that arose between Dalton and the French
chemist, Gay-Lussac, regarding the interpretation of
facts embodied in the law of combining volumes that
was enunciated by the latter in the interval between
1805 and 1809. Dalton insisted on an interpretation
which seemed to be connected logically with the views
of structure expressed in the atomic hypothesis and it
was seen that his interpretation led to inconsistencies.
Expeirmental facts cannot be controverted but their
interpretation may be changed to accord with chang-
ing viewpoints. Fortunately the new viewpoint need-
ed to establish an harmonious connection between the
law of combining volumes and the atomic hypothesis
was furnished in 1811 by the Italian physicist, Avo-
gadro. Avogadro's hypothesis bridged the gap be-
tween these facts of experiment and an interpretation
that brought them in agreement with the theory of
atoms. Furthermore it gave chemists contact with
the molecular theory which had been used by physic-
ists as a structural basis to explain the general behav-
ior of bodies since its revival by Daniel Bernoulli in
1738, likewise from an ancient Greek hypothesis.
Chemistry owes its first direct interest in the molecu-
lar theory to studies of gases. It is natural that the
first applications of this most important structural con-
cept should be limited to substances in the gaseous
condition. Only after a long interval has it become
possible to apply to the liquid and solid condition cer-
tain concepts that have developed from knowledge of
gases, whereby we can express in a few instances the
relative molecular magnitudes of these substances.
For so common and well known a material as water
the formula H20 expresses its molecular aggregation
as steam. For liquid water and solid ice all we know
about the molecular aggregation may be summed in
the statement that each represents a complex mixture
of different aggregates, including various hydrols.
Necessity of Logical Study
Chemistry affords its votaries many interesting con-
tacts with the affairs of everyday life. Relatively few
of these are derived from gases. Indeed relatively few
substances exist as gases under ordinary conditions.
The inclination to lead a class of students in pleasant
excursions over territory that has many points of in-
terest is always a temptation to an instructor. But
this tendency must not be given development to an ex-
tent that would vitiate the educational significance of
chemistry as a proving ground for accurate thinking.
If it is to retain its location in the divison of the exact
sciences, the method of logical development from sim-
ple and well-known to more complex and less well-
known phases must be maintained reasonably. Aim-
less excursionists are often bumped on the rocks of
uncharted seas and are either drowned in the sea of
uncertainty or left stranded in the desert of doubt.
Frequently they are unable to express themselves in-
telligibly because they have overstepped the funda-
mental parts of the language in reaching out for at-
tractive appearing fruits. The reason for beginning
the study of chemistry with a comprehensive treat-
ment of gases is clear. Our knowledge of gases has

been accumulating for a long time and the information
available is accurate. They permit a simple and direct
illustration of a fundamentally important theory.
TENDENCIES IN HIGH BUILDING
DESIGN
(Continued from Page io)
tinct strata of different scale cannot produce a unified
effect. Organic unity, and not an "arranged" effect,
is needed.
The jury was made up of four laymen and but one
architect, which proportion had better been reversed.
The poorest group of designs came from abroad, prob-
ably because few of the better European architects
entered the competition. It was misleading to give
many of these an "Honorable Mention" merely because
they were from abroad, and was unjust to other "Hon-
orable Mentions" and a number of designs markedly
superior to all the foreign designs with the exception
of the one receiving second prize. This one, by Eliel
Saarinen, a Finnish architect, is quite generally con-
ceded to be the most original and straightforward and
the finest contribution of all the designs submitted. It
is by an architect who has never designed a high build-
ing, but who for many years has been one of the lead-
ers of the progressive group in Europe, and a brilliant
contributor in 1906 to The Hague Peace Palace com-
petition, in which design is shown the germ of his
present essay. Mis project is remarkably free of
applied and unrelated form and it has beauty to an
unusual degree. It rises rhythmically and harmoni-
ously from the base upward, modulating subtly to the
top; all the masses, planes, and lines are in unison, as
in the master work of the exceptional man who appears
only at rare intervals.
If the Tribune competition had done nothing more
than to produce this design, it would have been well
worth while.
A SUPER BOILER
(Continued from Page 18)
Description of Setting and Auxiliaries
The boiler setting is of solid fire brick excepting the
upper portion of the fronts, which are of special design,
consisting of a tile lining, silocel brick insulation, and
a steel casing. The end walls in a setting of this type
usually require special construction to overcome the
tendency to fall inward. This has sometimes been taken
care of by giving the inner face of the wall a curvature
with a vertical axis forming a sort of horizontal arch.
In other cases large sections of the end walls have
been tied back by clamps and hangers around the indi-
vidual blocks. In the case of this boiler there are sev-
eral horizontal rows of large blocks tied back to steel
framing. This is expected to hold the walls back
effectively.
In order to reduce the sticking of clinkers to the
side and front walls, a belt of "Carbofrax A" carbo-
rundrum brick, approximately eighteen inches high,
completely encircles the furnace. This material is
highly refractory and practically eliminates any adhe-
sion of clinkers to the wall, the chipping off of which
after a long run under heavy load is often a very dif-
ficult and tedious task.
The service to which this boiler is put requires the
use of raw water to about ninety per cent of the total
output. To remove the scale-forming materials from
the water, the boiler is equipped with four live-steam
purifiers, each consisting of a drum containing a num-
ber of shallow pans over which the water flows. Each
purifier is connected directly to the steam space of the
boiler by a pipe of generous size, and the scale-forming
materials in the water are deposited as the water
becomes heated by the high-pressure steam. Sodium
carbonate is added to the water in carefully measured
amounts before the water enters the purifiers as an
additional safeguard against any scale formation. The
purifiers are located directly above the boiler and the
water flows to the boiler from them by gravity.
The auxiliaries have a capacity sufficient to take care
of the boiler when operating at three hundred per cent
of its rated capacity, a rate of generation which, it is
expected, will be reached after certain present difficul-
ties of furnace maintenance and of the characteristics
of the coal supply have been overcome.
The furnace air is supplied by two centrifugal motor-
driven blowers discharging into a large air chamber
below the stokers (a typical forced draft installation).
Access to this air chamber is easily gained by means
of an air lock.
The stack which will eventually care for two lx,ilers
of this size is self-supporting, brick-lined, and of
approximately seventeen feet inside diameter and 225
feet in height from the boiler-room floor.
It can be readily seen that this unit, while not strik-
ingly different from present practice, is, nevertheless,
a great step forward in saturated steam boiler design.
Its size, which is the largest yet attained, is the result
of a natural alteration in the design of existing boilers
to meet this special service. At the same time, the effi-
ciency has been improved and the investment per
horse-power materially reduced.
(Data furnished by Mr. J. H. Walker, Detroit Edi-
011 Company.)
The tallest reinforced concrete building in the United
States is one recently erected in New York City. It
stands on a site approximately 75 feet square and is
eighteen stories high.






It is with deep sorrow that we record here the
death of Claude M. Burns on March 21st at Lansing,
Michigan. He was taken ill with an attack of acute
appendicitis on Sunday, March iSth, and succumbed
to the disease on the following Wednesday.
Claude McLain Burns was born at Utica, Michi-
gan, April 12, 1895. Following his preparatory
schooling at Western High, Detroit, he entered the
University of Michigan in 1913 and graduated with
the degree of B.S.E. (C.E.) in 1917. During his col-
lege career Burns served as editor of both the Mich-
igan Technic and the Camp Davis Black Fly, and as
Vice-President of the Engineering Society. He was
a member of Phoenix Club, Toastmasters, and Web
and Flange.
Following the entry of our country into the World
War, Burns left college in May 1917 with a con-
tingent of engineers recruited for service in the
construction of the National Army Camp at Fort
Riley, Kansas. In October of the same year he en-
listed as a private in the 23rd Engineers and was
assigned to Camp Meade, Maryland. He went over
with his regiment soon thereafter. In France in com-
petition with a large class he was one of three en-
listed men who were commissioned following their
examination. Lieutenant Burns served with the
water supply service of Base Section No. 5, situated
at Bordeaux.
At the time of his death Burns was with the Mich-
igan State Highway Department in publicity work.
He was married September 16, 1922 to Miss Ellen
Christine Wood, who survives him.
To his closest friends Claude Burns was known
as a man of unusual ambition, with an intense inter-
est in the work or play before him, sincere in his
friendships and always an optimist.

German Deliveries Now Uncertain
Because of the depreciation of the German mark
it seems probable that the German Manufacturers
of electrical machinery and equipment will not be
able to deliver on the longer term contracts made in
marks. Information to the foregoing effect has been
received by the Department of Cimmerce.
Recently a daily paper published an extraordinary
communication ascribing the Hoboken (N. J.), pier fire
to the malign influence of electric current which in-
dulged in a flying leap from the lighting circuits to
the water.

INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS SHOULD BE WELL
LIGHTED.
From the employer's viewpoint, the big difference
between men who work out of doors and those who per-
form tasks inside the building, is the factor of light. Day-
light furnishes sufficient illumination outside during the
daytime working hours for men to pursue their tasks
efficiently and safely. But the proposition of getting
enough daylight into the interior of industrial buildings,
requires some thought.
It is not a difficult problem by any means, and any
employer can take advantage of daylight and utilize it for
lighting his building during the daytime, if he desires. It
is an excellent light, especially suitable for the eyes, re-
ducing eye strain and eye weariness to a minimum, and
has the great economic advantage of costing nothing.
To utilize daylight to the utmost, we must first pro-
vide means for allowing daylight rays to enter the interior
of buildings in sufficient quantity—namely, proper and
adequate windows and skylights. Many excellent instances
of buildings designed with a due regard to the importance
of daylight lighting can now be seen in many of our in-
dustrial cities. Such buildings present the appearance of
being practically all windows—"window walled," as they
are termed—and this type of daylight construction is
coming rapidly into favor, because it constitutes a more
healthy building for large numbers of employes, both
from the lighting and ventilation standpoints.
Among those who have constructed this type of mod-
ern industrial building may be mentioned: The Shredded
Wheat Co., Gillette Safety Razor Co., Lyon &amp; Healy Piano
Co., H. J. Heinz Co., Corona Typewriter Co., Skinners
Macaroni Co., Grape Juice Co., Dodge Bros., Nelson Valve
Co., Piston Ring Co., Remington Arms Co., and a great
many others.
The Larkin Co., Philadelphia, has erected a building
almost entirely glass, 85% being windows, and the Loomis
Breaker, operated by the D. L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., Nanticoke,
Pa., is literally a glass house, being 93.5% of glass. The
new buildings of the Winchester Repeating Arms Co.
have an average glass area of 58%.
An investigation covering 18 buildings constructed by
the Aberthaw Const. Co., Boston, shows that the average
window area is 57.5%.
These figures indicate how important the subject of
lighting is now considered by employers of industrial
labor, and how well the idea has been carried out by the
architects and engineers, in order that all parts of a build-
ing may receive sufficient daylight. But, in addition to
providing ample window space, there is another factor
which is equally important, and that is, equipping the
•windows with the proper glass.
The bright direct rays of the sun should not be per-
mitted to strike the eye, and we must provide a means for
reducing the glare to rays which will not be too bright.
This is accomplished by glass especially manufactured for
industrial windows, known as Factrolite. This glass pos-
sesses the property of breaking up the intense rays of the
sun and diffusing the light into the interior of the build-
ing in proper portions, solving the problem of sun glare.
If you are interested in the distribution of light
through Factrolite, we will send you a copy of Laboratory
Report—"Factrolited."

The Origin
of Cylindrical Qrinding
SEVENTY-TWO years ago, in 1851, me-
chanics knew that a hardened shaft would
outwear a soft one. Yet the hardening
process distorted shafts enough to make them
useless; and straightening was not a satisfactory
method of remedying the distortions.
By 1852, however, a lathe was in use whose
spindle bearings had been hardened and ground.
These ground bearings are the first evidences
of cylindrical grinding.
The unknown discoverer of grinding used an
iron wheel having a lead rim charged with
emery. This wheel, driven by an overhead belt,
was mounted on the tool post of a lathe.
As early as 1864 Brown &amp; Sharpe were build-
ing grinding machines of the lathe type. In
1868, Joseph R. Brown designed the Universal
Grinding Machine which appeared at the Cen-
tennial Exposition in 1876.
From these beginnings the Brown &amp; Sharpe
line has grown to include 18 sizes of grinding
machines—Universal, Plain, Crankshaft, Surface,
Tool and Cutter. These high-grade machines
are noted for their accuracy and capacity for
producing work of the highest quality.

THE ALASKA RAILROAD
By COLONEL JAMES GORDON STEESE*
M. Am. Soc. C. E.
ON the 15th of July, 1923, the late President
Harding drove a golden spike at the north
end of the Tanana River Bridge, Nenana, Alaska,
thereby officially completing the construction of
The Alaska Railroad. The Act of Congress, ap-
proved March 12, 1914, authorized the President to
locate, construct, maintain, and operate a railroad
or railroads to connect one or more of the open
Pacific ocean harbors on the southern coast of
Alaska with the navigable waters in the interior,
and with a coal field or fields.
On the 13th of July, 1923, President Harding
landed from the Naval Transport Henderson at
Seward, an open-all-the-year-round south coast
harbor of Alaska, and boarded his private car Den-
ali (Indian name for Mt. McKinlcy) attached to
the end of a special train on The Alaska Railroad.
This train consisted of the President's car, an obser-
vation compartment car, a diner, three sleeping
cars, a coach (smoker), the Chairman's business
car B-l. and a baggage car. On the 14th of July,
1923, the President was shown the coal fields from
which is obtained the coal used to drive the trains
on The Alaska Railroad. On the 15th of July, 1923,
the train reached Nenana, the head of navigation
on the Tanana River, the principal tributary of the
great Yukon. After the ceremony, the train pro-
ceeded to Fairbanks, the main distributing point for
the Interior.
*Colonel Steese is Chairman of the Alaska Railroad,
President of the Alaska Road Commission, District Engin-
eer for Rivers and Harbors, and Consulting Engineer,
16th Lighthouse District, for the Federal Government,
and Director of Public Works for the Territorial Govern-
ment. His article on "The Alaska Road Commission"
was published in the March, 1923, issue of the TECHNIC.
The Government Railway Project in Alaska
The Government Railway Project in Alaska was
originally reported upon by the Alaska Railroad
Commission, appointed by President Taft in 1912,
and headed by General Jay J. Morrow, now Gover-
nor of the Panama Canal. Upon receiving author-
ity by the Act of March 12, 1914, the President
placed supervision of the project under the direc-
tion of the Secretary of the Interior and designated
the Alaskan Engineering Commission as the con-
struction agency to be permanently resident in
Alaska to handle the work. After additional sur-
veys and investigations, the President selected the
route in the spring of 1915, and active construction
continued since that date except for greatly cur-
tailed activity during the World War. John C. Got-
wals is Vice-Chairman of the present Commission.
The Golden Spike ceremony was very simple.
Colonel Steese, in his capacity as Chairman and
Chief Engineer of the Alaskan Engineering Com-
mission, in a brief address, outlined the development
of the project and formally announced the comple-
tion of construction to the Secretary of the Interior,
the Honorable Hubert Work. Secretary Work, in
turn, reported to the President that the will of Con-
gress, as expressed in the Act of March 12, 1914,
had now been accomplished. President Harding
then spoke of the effect of the accomplishment of
this great task upon the future of the Territory. He
then received the golden spike from the Honorable
Scott C. Bone, Governor of the Territory, and a
silver spike-maul from Commissioner Steese, and
performed the last symbolic rite of the ceremony.
The Tanana River bridge, under the shadow of

which the ceremony was performed, is a notable
structure, 700 foot simple truss; there is only one
longer span of similar type in America.
Operations of the Alaska Railroad
The distance from Seward to Fairbanks, over the
operated line, is 470.3 miles. Spurs to the Eska,
Jonesville, and Chickaloon coal mines in the Mata-
nuska District, and to the Healy River coal mines
in the Nenana District, aggregate an additional 46
miles of standard gauge. A four and a half mile nar-

the foreground is the construction camp
row gauge spur to the Moose Creek coal mines and
a 39 mile narrow gauge branch from Fairbanks to
the gold creeks as far as Chatanika bring the total
operated mileage up to 560 miles. The Alaska
Railroad also operates a River Boat Service on
the Tanana and Yukon Rivers between Nenana
and Holy Cross, a distance of 750 miles,
carrving passengers, mail, express, and freight.
It has through billing agreements covering freight
service from Seattle or Tacoma to points
on the Yukon River and its principal tribu-
taries between the International Boundary at Eagle
and Bering Sea at St. Michael. It also has an agree-
ment covering automobile service on the Richard-
son Highway from Fairbanks to Chitina and Val-
dez, 410 miles. In addition, it operates telegraph
and telephone lines, coal mines, docks, power plants,
hospitals, hotels, and commissaries.
In 1915, Seward and Fairbanks were flourishing
towns, each being the distributing center for an
immense hinterland. Seward received its supplies
all the year round by ocean service from Seattle.
Fairbanks received all its supplies by river boat
during the open season of navigation. The country
between was an almost uninhabited wilderness.
The only overland route then in existence was the
Richardson Highway, some 200 miles to the east-
ward of the route selected for the railroad. It was
necessary therefore to develop and carry various
agencies along with the actual railroad construc-
tion. Ocean docks, towns, and camps, machine
shops, hospitals, schools, etc., all had to be pro-
vided. Rolling stock, construction equipment and
supplies of all kinds had to be shipped in from
Seattle. Such supplies were then carried inland
by boat or pack-horse in summer and by horse-sled
or dog-team in winter.
In the actual construction, clearing of right of
way, grubbing, grading, excavation and other kinds
of labor which could be standardized, were let out
tostation-men. All tools, powder, camp equipment,
subsistence supplies, etc., were rented or sold to the
station-men by the railway supply department.
Building of bridges, snowsheds, laying of track, etc.,
were performed on force account. Several large
steel bridges were fabricated and erected by con-
tract, the piers and approaches being built on force
account.
Expenses and Revenues
The total amount appropriated by Congress for
the construction of the railroad and related works,
including unexpended balances available to June 30,
1924, was $56,000,000. There had actually been ex-
pended, including certain extraneous activities up to
December 31, 1922. a total of $55,096,318.83, classi-
fied as follows:
Investment in Road and Equip-
ment $51,645,227.98
Investment in Miscellaneous Phy-
sical Property 2,392,585.65
Income and Expense, Accounts.. 1,058,505.20
Total $55,096,318.83

preciation, and Eska Coal Mine

The Navy coal mining operations, for the pur-
pose of securing a reserve of fuel for the Navy, were
handled through the facilities of the Alaskan En-
gineering Commission as a matter of administrative
convenience.
Soon after starting operations, the Government
purchased and rehabilitated the Alaska Northern
Railroad, 71 miles of standard gauge track extend-
ing from Seward northward to Kern Creek, and
the Tanana Valley Railroad, 46 miles of narrow
gauge track extending from Fairbanks to Chena and
the gold creeks between Fairbanks and Chatanika.
dollars. The deficit is met, of course, by direct
appropriation by Congress.
Transportation Situation
The entire transportation situation in the Ter-
ritory has been changed by the completion of The
Alaska Railroad. Whereas, heretofore it had been
necessary for all supplies for an entire year to be
shipped up the Yukon River during the short sum-
mer season, with the attendant heavy charges for
interest on investment, insurance, storage, deter-
ioration, and depreciation, it is now possible to dis-
tribute the same shipments throughout the entire

Typical track and scenery through the Indian River Valley, Mile 268, Alaska Railroad
These lines were immediately put into operation.
As additional mileage was constructed train ser-
vice was extended, so that considerable revenue
accrued during the construction period. The rev-
enues for 1920 were about $350,000; 1921, $550,000;
1922, $720,000. For July. 1923, the transportation
revenues alone were $115,000 as compared with
$48,000 for July, 1922. This indicates a healthy
growth. As with all railroads through pioneer
country, it will be a generation possibly before The
Alaska Railroad will earn full interest on the invest-
ment. For the current year, it is expected to re-
duce the operating deficit to less than a million
year. Frequently shipments missed the last boat,
causing great inconvenience and even distress.
For example, in the fall of 1920 an important
bridge was ordered for a stream crossing about 28
miles out of Fairbanks. This bridge was shipped
from Seattle to St. Michael in the summer of 1921
soon after navigation opened. It caught the last
boat up the river. An early freeze-up caught this
boat 200 miles short of destination. As it would
have cost $135 per thousand board feet for freight-
ing over the snow, the bridge as well as all other
supplies lay there till the summer of 1922, when it
reached Fairbanks, was freighted overland and

erected. Meanwhile, about $1200 was spent on
patching up the old bridge to carry the 192i traffic.
Last winter, a 250 foot highway bridge was taken
down, using the ice as false-work, freighted three
miles by bob-sled to The Alaska Railroad, hauled
about 400 miles over The Alaska Range into the
Interior, freighted 12 miles again over the snow by
bob-sled and re-erected over another river, again
using the ice as false-work, and all in less than 90
davs.

Steel bridge over the Tanana River built at a cost of
approximately $1,250,000. With a single span of
700 feet, it is the second largest bridge of
this type in the world
inaugurated last summer by the Brooklyn Daily
Eagle party of 70 people, over half of them being
ladies. The entire tour requires three weeks from
Seattle back to Seattle and costs about $350, all
expenses included.
Leaving Seward, The Alaska Railroad crosses the
Chugach Range through two passes amidst snow-
covered mountains, glaciers, and lakes, then follows
the shore of Turnagain Arm to Anchorage, Mile
114. It then follows Knik Arm, crosses the Mata-
nuska Valley, and follows up the Susitna River to
the summit of the Alaska Range through Broad
Pass, Mile 313, elevation 2337 feet. Several large
glaciers are passed within a stone's throw of the
track. There are tunnels, trestle spirals, and one
complete loop where the track makes two reversed
horse-shoe bends and then crosses under itself. The
Susitna River is crossed upon a simple steel truss
of 504 foot span. Hurricane Gulch is crossed upon
a steel arch of 384 foot span, 300 feet above the
creek.
After leaving Broad Pass, The Alaska Railroad
follows down the north slope of the main Alaska
Range, past Mt. McKinley National Park, through
the Nenana and Healy River Canyons, and across
the Tanana River bottom of Nenana. At Nenana
the Tanana River is crossed on a 700-foot bridge,
45 feet above highest high water. The railroad
In another case, a rush order of 200 tons of heavy
mining equipment left Seattle in January of 1923.
In sixty days, these supplies traveled 1600 miles by
ocean freighter to Seward, 470 miles by rail to
Fairbanks, and 86 miles by bob-sleds drawn by
caterpillar tractors over the Richardson Highway
and tributaries to final destination. Without The
Alaska Railroad, that equipment would have landed
in Fairbanks during the summer of 1923, where rt
would have lain till mid-winter of 1924 when snow
conditions would permit it to be handled over the
last 43 miles of sled-road tributary to the Richard-
son Highway.
Tour of A faska
With the completion of The Alaska Railroad, a
most remarkable circular tour through the interior
of the Territory is now possible. This tour in-
cludes a 16(X) mile ocean voyage from Seattle or
Vancouver up the Inside Passage, then across the
Gulf of Alaska, through Prince William Sound, and
up Resurrection Bay to Seward, touching at all
Alaskan ports; then 470 miles over The Alaska Rail-
road to Fairbanks; then 320 miles over The Rich-
ardson Highway to Chitina; then 130 miles over
the Copper River &amp; Northwestern Railway to Cor-
dova; and then a 1400 mile return ocean voyage
through Prince William Sound, the Gulf of Alaska,
and the Inside Passage. This tour was formally

Other Railroads in Alaska
In addition to The Alaska Railroad, there are two
other railroads operating as common carriers in the
Territory of Alaska. The Copper River &amp; North-
western Railway, above referred to, extends from

The New Steel Industry of Australia
Hoic it Will Effect America s Exports to That Country
By Prof. Wm. H. Hobbs, University of Michigan
A L'STRALIA has had no prehistoric iron age,
t\. man's early implements in that part of the
world having been made either of wood or stone.
The Australian "black fellow" represented a very
low order of intelligence; he did not put out to sea,
and he was so far removed from other cultures that
he learned nothing of the iron age as it developed
elsewhere. The peculiar isolation from which Aus-
tralia has suffered, and still suffers, has been reflect-
ed in her primitive men almost as much as in her
lower animals.
Australia possesses, however, all the necessary
elements for a successful steel industry. She has
ample deposits of iron and coal, both of excellent
quality, and she has the markets for her products
in steel and iron. With a territory as large as the
United States, she has a population of only five and
a half millions, less than that of the city of New
York. Nearly half of this population is to be found
in the four port cities of Sydney, Melbourne. Ade-
laide, and Brisbane, the capitals of her four largest
states.
It is only during the last decade that the steel
industry has developed much importance in Aus-
tralia, the two plants constructed having been
located at Lithgow and Newcastle in New South
Wales, respectively ninety-six miles west and about
seventy-five miles north of Sydney. These locali-
ties are over the great coal basin of New South
Wales, the coal of which is of an excellent coking
variety.
The smaller of the two iron works, that at Lith-
gow, first took on importance when it passed into
new hands in 1908. The main works at Lithgow
is in the Blue Mountains three thousand feet above
the sea, but the collierv and coking plant are at
Dapto on the sea-coast fifty-six miles south of
Sydney, near where a new and modern steel plant of
the company is soon to be erected. The Lithgow
Company is practically self-supporting, having its
own iron ores in New South Wales and Tasmania,
its own coal and ferro-manganese mines, and its
limestone quarries. Both the iron ores and the coal
are mined within a hundred miles of the smelters,
and the limestone is quarried only twenty-five miles
distant. Its iron ores are magnetite and hematite,
all higher than fifty-seven per cent in iron. The
cast iron pipe plants of the company, located in and
near Sydney, are the largest in Australia and are
claimed to be among the most modern of any in the
world.
The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, Ltd., the
other and larger steel concern of Australia, has been
the largest of the great Broken Hill mining com-
panies which developed the silver, lead, and gold
of the "Great Barrier Reef." In a period of 34
years, it paid to its shareholders a total of over
sixty-four millions of dollars and distributed a
similar amount in wages to its employees. The
end of its workings at Broken Hill is, however,
already in sight; and a considerable part of its
interest and capital has recently been put into the
steel industry.
The iron deposits of this company are two moun-
tains of hard hematite which were formerly quar-
ried for flux to supply the Broken Hill smelters.
They are named Iron Knob and Iron Monarch and
are situated on the west shore of Spencer Gulf about
100 miles northwest of Adelaide in South Australia.
The ore is hematite, runs about 68 per cent of
iron, and is hauled by rail a distance of but 35
miles to tide water, where from the bins it goes

It is 1200 miles to the smelters at Newcastle, but
the returning vessels carry the steel products to the
markets of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, which
ports are passed enroute. The average haul of the
coal to the smelters is 15 miles, but the limestone
flux which is of exceptionally pure variety, is
brought from Tasmania. , "*

It was only in 1913 that the plans for this great
plant were completed, and the material for con-
struction was ordered early in that year. Mr. David
Baker, an American, was placed in charge as Gen-
eral Manager and has occupied that position
continuously. The first cargo of material for con-
struction arrived at the site on New Year's Day,
1914, and the foundations only had been put in
when the Declaration of the World War called a
halt. After only a few days of delay the Board of
Directors decided that the early completion of the
works would make Australia independent of outside
sources of supply for most of its steel requirements
and would thus greatly aid the Allies to win the
war. Construction was accordingly pushed; the
first blast furnace was lighted in March, 1915; and
the first steel was made and the first rails rolled
in the following April.
Vitally important consequences flowed from this
decision and execution. The strategic rail line from
Port Augusta near Adelaide to Kalgoorlie in West
Australia was put through and connected up that
western state to the eastern ones; rails were sup-
plied to South Africa to replace those sent to
France; rails and munition bar were supplied to
the British War Department; and steel joists and
ship-plates were furnished in sufficient quantity for
all the ships built by the Australian Common-
wealth.
At the present time this great modern steel plant
consists of: (1) a coke-oven department with 224
Semet-Solvay by-product ovens of the recuperative
type; (2) a blast furnace department with four
furnaces, one of which is for the manufacture of
ferro-manganese; (3) an open-hearth department
consisting of 7 basic furnaces of 65 tons rated capa-
city and with hearths 33' 6" x 15'; (4) a blooming
mill provided with three 4-hole pit furnaces, a 35"
geared Mackintosh &amp; Hemphill mill with two high-
pressure cylinders 62" x 42" using steam at 150 lbs.
pressure; and, (5) a rail mill which consists of three
strands of rolls in line, of 28" pitched diameter.
The rail mill has a capacity of 1000 tons per day
of 80 lb. rails, but this output can be doubled if
necessary. The steel produced has thus far met
every requirement for railroad tracks and for loco-
motive forgings; as well as for structural work,
ship and boiler plates, sheets and wire.
Sheets and wire are, in Australia, commodities
of the first importance. Outside the urban centers
houses are almost invariably roc-fed with corru-
gated iron; water cisterns are made of the same
material; wire fencing is employed to enclose vast
"runs" for sheep and cattle; all agricultural land
must be fenced in with rabbit-proof netting to keep
out the rabbits, and a 5 foot fence of the same
material has been constructed across Australia from
north to south in order to protect the western sec-
tion from the same pest. Sheets, fencing, and
netting have heretofore been imported from Amer-
ica. Since 1911 a company in Melbourne has been
using American and Continental rods to manufac-
ture barb-wire fencing, but in 1918 it began to draw
its supplies from the Broken Hill Proprietary Com-
pany and decided to construct a large modern wire

of Warrington, England, decided to establish an
Australian plant, and somewhat later amalgamated
with the Australian company under the name

these combined plants is now 75009 to 100000 tons

ranging from heavy fencing down to the finest
gauges of tinned wires such as are in use for mat-
tress making, etc. The plant is capable of dealing
with all the wire and net requirements of the coun-
try.

galvanized sheeting was in the year before the war
over 100,000 tons. An up-to-date plant for the
manufacture of such sheets, as well as of black
sheets and galvanized plain sheets, has been con-
structed by the Lysaghts Newcastle Works, Ltd.,
which already is able to put out 450 tons of corru-
gated roofing per week.
It is only a question of time when Australia will
become self-supporting as respects other important
manufactures. At the present time she imports her

motor cars largely from the United States at a
cost augmented by about one-third; and one Ameri-
can harvester company is reported to have done
a business of a half-million dollars in agricultural
machinery during the past year.
As regards the future supply of raw materials,
the coal and iron deposits of Australia are both
vast and of excellent quality. In addition to the
iron ores now mined at Iron Knob and vicinity,
which are believed to have reserves of 130,000,000
tons, there are the great deposits of Koolan and
Cockatoo Islands at tide water in northwest Austra-
lia with a content of iron of 65 to 68 per cent and
with reserves estimated at about 100,000,000 tons.
These could hardly be worked profitably today be-
cause of their remoteness from the Newcastle coal
basin; but, like other large iron deposits in Queens-
land they are a matter for exploitation in the dis-
tant future.
*This article is based quite largely upon the paper by
Mr. David Baker entitled, "The Development of the Iron
and Steel Industry in Australia," a paper read before
the American Iron and Steel Institute at its May meeting,
1922. Mr. Baker is the General Manager of the Broken
Hill Proprietary Company whose plant is located at New-
castle in New South Wales.
NEW AID TO LUMBER INDUSTRY
For many years lumber has been cut in this coun-
try, without any effective attempt to replenish the
supply. Now that the end of the timber supply in
"this country is in sight, measures are being taken
to avert the catastrophe of destruction of timber.
Timber has been so abundant that it has been
cut, without any science, and no attempt has been
made toward reforestation. It was as if a farmer in
the wheat territory went out and reaped the wheat
harvest, and then went fishing till next harvest
time, with the expectation that there would again
be wheat in abundance for him to cut. If we are
to maintain a timber reserve, we must begin to
treat it as a crop, and plant it, cultivate it, and cut
it, scientifically.
The Federal Government has taken steps toward
this end, and has established forest experiment
stations in different parts of the country, the latest
one being recently inaugurated at St. Paul, Minn.,
which location is representative of the territory
tributary to the Great Lakes. These stations will
concern themselves with experiments designed to
promote forest preservation, and reforestation. The
future of our country depends much on these sta-
tions, for reforestation is today of great impor-
tance, as the new forests must be planted shortly
if they are to be ready for use when the present
ones are exhausted.
There is also a new government laboratory at
Madison, Wis., which is engaged in experimenting
on processes of treating wood after it has been
turned into lumber. This laboratory offers short
courses at a small cost, open to everyone interested
in the use and preparations for use of lumber.

An Efficient Heat Interchange Apparatus
By LAWFORD H. FRY
Metallurgical Engineer, Standard Steel Works Co.
THE modern locomotive bailer stands pre-emi-
nent as a compact and efficient apparatus for
the production and utilization of heat and in spite
of its importance the amount of technical literature
devoted to it is comparatively small.
The present note is intended to illustrate the ef-
ficiency with which a well designed locomotive
boiler operates and to indicate the sources of this
efficiency.
The boiler chosen for consideration is that of the
Pennsylvania Railroad K4S Pacific type passenger
locomotive. Complete tests of this engine are de-
scribed in Bulletin No. 29 of the Railroad company's
locomotive testing plant. The drawing of the boil-
er, Fig. 1, is reproduced from this bulletin, from
which has also been taken the experimental data,
on which the present study is based. Tests were
made at various rates of working, ranging from a
very light output up to the maximum possible.
What follows is based on the figures obtained in
test 4067. In this test a boiler efficiency of 65.6
per cent with an output of 1957 boiler horse power
was obtained, under conditions which represent
a high rate of working which can, however, be
maintained continuously. In stationary practice we
expect, with modern equipment, to obtain an ef-
ficiency better than 65 per cent, but we do not
expect to compress a 2000 H.P. boiler plant, boiler,
firebox and draft appliance into a space -10'-6"x8'-
0"x8'-0". The securing of the efficiency and the
capacity within this limited space is a noteworthy
achievement.
Particulars of the test, to which reference has
been made, show that it lasted one hour during
which time 7038 Ibs. of coal were fired and 50,583
Ibs. of water evaporated. This is firing at the rate
of 102 Ibs. of coal per square foot of grate per hour
with a steam production of 12.5 pounds of steam per
square foot of evaporative surface per hour, and 7.2
Ib. of superheated steam per pound of coal fired.
From the foregoing information and from infor-
mation regarding firebox and smokebox tempera-
tures and gas composition given in the Bulletin, the
present writer has made a study of the heat dis-
tribution during the test. The analysis of the smoke-
box gases enables the amount of air supplied per
pound of coal burned to be computed as 12.46 Ib.
Then as each pound of coal contains 0.94 Ib. of
combustible, including nitrogen and oxygen, the
weight of gases of combustion is 13.4 Ib. per pound
of coal burned. From this and the smokebox tem-
perature of 546° F. it is possible to arrive at a heat
balance which takes the following form:—
A. (a) Heat effective in evaporation.... 65.6%
B. Heat lost :—
(b) In sensible heat in smokebox
gases 11.4%
(c) By production of CO 1.8%
(d) By fuel escaping unburnt. . . . 17.9%
(c) By external radiation, etc 3.3%
Total heating value of coal fired 100.0%
Note:—The total heat taken up by the
boiler is made up of (a) the heat
utilized in evaporation and (e) the
heat lost by external radiation and
amounts to 68.9%
In order to bring out more clearly the meaning
of these figures Fig. 2 has been prepared. The
height of the shaded area (ordinates) represents
amount of heat, while the horizontal distances (ab-
scissae) represent the distance from firebox to
smokebox. At the extreme left the height of all
the shaded areas represents the total heating value
of the coal fed into the firebox per hour. This is
taken as 100 per cent. The heavy horizontal line
AA divides the shaded area into two parts. The
height of the part below AA is proportional to the
heat lost by imperfect combustion of the fuel, while
the height of the shaded area above AA is propor-
tional to the amount of heat generated in the fire-
box. It will be seen that of the heating value of
the coal fired 80.3 per cent appears in the firebox
while the remaining 19.7 per cent is lost through
incomplete combustion, 1.8 per cent by the pro-
duction of CO, and 17.9 per cent by the escape
of fuel unburnt. This last item covers the losses
by unburnt fuel through the grate, and by the
escape of sparks and cinders through the flues to
the smokebox. This loss of practically 18 per cent
of the fuel unconsumed, will appear high from the
point of view of the stationary boiler, but is very
satisfactory for -a locomotive boiler with full load.
The unburnt fuel escapes mainly through the flues
to the smokebox and represents part of the price
that has to be paid for the ability of the boiler to
deliver a high output from so restricted a volume.
In order to force the boiler to a rate of firing of

SCALE-FEET A INCHES
102 lb. of coal per square foot of grate per hour,
a high draft is necessary, and the resulting rush of
air through the firebox sweeps away a certain por-
tion of the coal before combustion is completed.
This loss increases rapidly as the boiler is forced.
With the boiler and coal under consideration, if
it is desired to increase the boiler horsepower by
20 per cent from 2000 to 2400 H. P. it is necessary
to increase the rate of firing from 102 to 165 lb.
of coal per sq. ft. of grate per hour, that is by o0
per cent, and the loss by unburnt fuel is doubled,
being increased from 18 per cent to 36 per cent.
Now returning to the heat produced and offered
to the boiler; on examining the left hand or fire-
box end of the diagram it will be seen that the
shaded area above the line AA is divided into two
parts which represent:
A. Heat radiated direct from flame to firebox
surface. This is 29.1 per cent of the heat in
the coal fired or 36.2 per cent of the heat
actually produced.
B. Heat carried by the gases of combustion.
This is the sensible heat in the gases corre-
sponding to the firebox temperature of 2440°
F. and amounts to 51.2 per cent of the heat
in the coal fired, or 63.8 per cent of the heat
actually produced.
Now the heat radiated direct to the firebox sur-
face is absorbed completely, and the gases of com-
bustion enter the flues with a temperature of 2440°
F. and giving up a part of their heat emerge from
the Hues with a temperature of 546°. The horizon-
tal distance BB represents the length of the flues, 19
feet, and the curved line CC shows the rate at
which the gases give up heat in passing through the
flues. It will be seen that the gases which enter
the flues carrying 51.5 per cent of the heat of the
coal fired emerge with only 11.4 per cent of the
heat. The latter figure gives the final loss due to
sensible heat in the smokebox gases. Adding to
this the losses due to incomplete combustion which
have been seen to be 19.7 per cent, we have the
heat distribution at the right hand or smokebox
end of the diagram, as follows:—
Heat absorbed by boiler 68.9%
Heat lost by incomplete absorption.... 11.4%
Heat lost by incomplete combustion.. 19.7%
Total heating value of coal fired. . . . 100.0%
It is evident that the boiler is more efficient in
heat absorption than in heat production. Table 1
brings together the various percentages of heat dis-
tribution and offers some other relations between
the quantities discussed.
Column 3 shows that of the heat in the coal fired,
80.3 per cent appears in the firebox.
Column 4 shows that of the heat generated, 36.2
per cent is radiated direct to the firebox


November, 1923
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and 63.8 per cent is carried out of the
firebox as sensible heat in the gases of
combustion.
Column 5 shows that of the heat generated, the boil-
er absorbs 36.2 per cent by way of the
firebox and 49.6 per cent in the flues,
giving an efficiency of heat absorption of
85.8 per cent; the remaining 14.2 per
cent being lost as sensible heat in the
smokebox gases.
Column 6 shows that of the heat taken up by the
boiler, 41.0 per cent is received by the
firebox as radiation while 59.0 per cent
is taken up by the flues from the gases of
combustion.
If other tests with the same boiler and the same
coal, but at other rates of firing, are examined it
will be found that the efficiency of heat absorption
remains very nearly constant at approximately 86
per cent in all cases and that though the over-all
boiler efficiency is increased as the rate of firing
is reduced, this increase is practically entirely due
to an increase in the efficiency of combustion, that
is to a decrease in the loss by the escape of coal
unburnt.
So far the methods used in ascertaining the heat
distribution have not been discussed, but before
concluding it is desirable to put on record the pro-
cedure involved in determining the quantity of heat
radiated to the firebox, and in arriving at the cur-
vature of the line CC representing the heat trans-
fer in the flues.
RADIATION
We find from the heat balance that 80.3 per
cent of the heat in the coal fired is effectively pro-
duced in the firebox, and this when firing 102 Ib.
of coal of 14467 B. T. U. per sq. ft. of grate per
hour, gives a production of 1,180,000 B. T. U. per
sq. ft. of grate per hour. We also find that the
weight of gases of combustion per sq. ft. of grate
per hour is 1115 Ib. and that the gases at the fire-
box temperature of 2440° F. carry 753.000 B. T. U.
as sensible heat and in the latent heat of the water
vapor. The difference between the heat actually
produced and the heat carried by the gases which
in this case amounts to 427,000 B. T. U. is the
amount of the heat radiated directly from the flame
to the firebox surface. This radiation per square
foot of grate area amounts to 96,500 B. T. U. per
square foot of firebox surface as there are 4.43 sq. ft.
of firebox surface for each sq. ft. of grate area. Xow
if the firebox flame were radiating to the firebox
surface under perfect 'black body' conditions the
heat in B. T. U. per hour received per square foot
of firebox surface would be given by the expression
1600 (1^6)'- 1600 y^)' where T is the absolute
temperature of the radiating flame and t the absolute
temperature of the receiving surface in degrees
Fahr. In the present case with a flame temperature
of 2240° F. and a surface temperature of 390° F.
the rate of radiation by the above expression is
118,000 B. T. U. per square foot of firebox surface
per hour. The radiation measure as above is 96500
B. T. U. or 83 per cent of the radiation under ideal
black body conditions. Tests with this and other
locomotive boilers show that when running with
light loads the radiation is about 40 per cent of the
ideal, the percentage increasing as the boiler Is
forced until at the highest power the actual radia-
tion corresponds closely with that given by the form-
ula. Apparently at low power firebox is not com-
pletely filled with flame, but as the boiler is forced
the volume of flame increases until at maximum
power ideal conditions are closely approximated.
Before leaving the question of radiation, we call
attention to the high rate of evaporation due to the
large quantity of heat thus transferred to the fire-
box surface. This surface as we have seen receives
96500 B. T. U. per square foot per hour. This is suf-
ficient to produce 80 Ib. of steam per sq. ft. per
hour while the average evaporation for the whole
evaporative surface is only 12.5 pounds of steam per
square foot per hour.
HEAT TRANSFER IN FLUES. The curve
representing the transfer of heat, or what is prac-
tically the same thing, the fall of temperature,
as the gases of combustion pass along the flues
from firebox to a smokebox, has been constructed
by using the formulae for heat transfer proposed
by the present writer, Trans. A.S.M.E. 1917 p.
709. Experience has shown that in locomotive
work these give results having a very satisfactory
degree of accuracy. In the present 'case starting
with the firebox temperature and the weight of the
gases of combustion, the computed smokebox tem-
perature comes out within four degrees of the
actual. This is a closer check than can usually be
counted on.
The following table shows the drop in tempera-
ture along the flue and also the amount of heat
(expressed as a percentage of the heat of the coal
fired remaining in the gases at each stage.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The Military Engineer
By Major William T. Carpenter*
Coast Artillery Corps, University of Michigan
WE are now in the mechanical age and warfare
has therefore taken on a decidedly mechanical
nature. The influence of the engineer was apparent
in all phases of the late war. The support and act-
ive cooperation of the engineering profession is
vitally essential in any plan for national defense.
Modern wars are fought by Nations in arms and,
as President Wilson said during the late war, "The
whole Nation must be a team in which each man
shall play the part for
which he is best fitted."
The infantry is the
backbone of the army.
All other arms and
branches such as Artil-
lery, C a v a 1 r y. Air
Forces, Engineers,
Ordnance, Signal, Sup-
ply and Transport are
contributary and essen-
tial to the team.
In war the services
of the engineer are re-
quired both in the front
line and in rear of the
combatant forces. His
greatest effort must be
made in the rear of the
line in the production
of war materials and
supplies, in the manu-
facture and supply of
commercial products
and in the maintenance
of those utilities neces-
sary to the non-com-
batant population. Due
to the shortage of man-
power in the fields of production his ingenuity and
skill are stressed to the limit during war. A sane

MAJOR WM. T. CARPENTER
*Major Carpenter recently took up his duties at the Uni-
versity of Michigan as Professor of Military Science and
Tactics. He graduated from the University of Kentucky
in 1898 with the degree of Bachelor of Mechanical Engin-
eering and received his M. E. degree_from the same insti-
tution in 1918. Major Carpenter served in the Engineer
Corps during the Spanish-American War and was a col-
onel of Heavy Artillery in the late war.
preparedness in peace time will obviate some of
these difficulties.
One of the important provisions of the law which
established our present Military Policy is that
which provided the Council of National Defense.
Among the important duties of the Council are:
The promotion and coordination of industrial pre-
paredness; to increase domestic production of
articles and materials essential to the support of
armies and of the peo-
ple during the interrup-
tion of foreign com-
merce; to give informa-
tion to producers and
manufacturers as to the
class of supplies needed
by the military and
other services of the
Government; the crea-
tion of relations which
will render possible the
immediate concentra-
tion of the resources of
the Nation; the devel-
opment of means and
routes of transporta-
tion. This touches the
realm of the engineer
and all branches of his
profession.
The military courses
provided for the train-
ing in college of our
young engineers are
designed to give them
a knowledge of the re-
quirements of war, a
knowledge of our mili-
tary mistakes of the past and our needs for prepar-
edness in the future so that they may be prepared
to lend a hand, not only in war but also in peace,
toward the coordination and development of our
industrial, commercial and military pursuits, all of
which are so vital to a state of national defense.
The late war cost the United States more than
one million dollars an hour for over two years, a
total of nearly twenty-four billions. Of this sum
over fourteen billion was spent on our land forces


November, 1923
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and of this amount forty-one per cent was spent
directly by our engineers of the Ordnance Depart-
ment, Engineer Corps, Signal Corps, Air Service
and Chemical Warfare Service. The Ordnance De-
partment spent over four billion for munitions,
more than half being for artillery ammunition which
in a way is a measure of the importance of the
artillery arm. These figures do not include the im-
mense sums spent by other departments for build-
ings and transportation. They are quoted to show
the great part played by the Engineering pro-
fessions.
Marshal Foch paid the following tribute to the
Engineering profession when addiessing the En-
gineering Societies in New York during his visit
to this country:
**** "Tt was due largely to engineering and the
engineering industry that the war was brought to
a successful conclusion. To the engineering pro-
fession also we are indebted for many great lessons
which will be vital to mankind in the future.
"The armies could not have done a great deal
without the effort of the engineer. Success was
made possible to a great extent by the industry of
the people at home, but when it became a question
of decision, when the decisive moments arrived,
the engineer stood out as an essential factor in
complete triumph.
"What would have become of the armies without
the technical training, without the professional
knowledge which you have exercised for the Allies
and which enabled us to lead our armies in the
field, to feed them, to protect them and to facilitate
their advance quickly and decisively?
"It is for these reasons that I am pleased to find
you here today, to receive from you so splendid
a welcome and to express my gratitude and the
gratitude of France, as well as the recognition of
my countrymen for the tremendous sacrifices made
by you and the men of your calling.
"I am grateful to you for including me in your
ranks as a member of the four great engineering
societies of the United States." ****
The achievements of our army in peace time have
been overlooked or forgotten. The army has not
only afforded protection to our people in the west-
ward movement of our civilization, but it has con-
ducted explorations, blazed the trails in advance of
the settlers, made surveys and prepared maps for
their use, constructed roads and bridges, and main-
tained supply bases along the overland routes. The
colonization of our outlying possessions has also
fallen to the lot of the army.
The Lewis and Clarke Expedition, an army enter-
prise, opened the great northwest. The army has
made the development of Alaska possible by open-
ing up its harbors and rivers to navigation, by
building trails, roads and railways and by maintain-
ing law and order in the territory.
The Signal Corps constructed and has since oper-
ated the Alaskan cable and 600 miles of telegraph
lines and the radio system connecting the territory
with the homeland. The Signal Corps operates
hundreds of telephone systems and the business
transacted over its cable, telegraph and radio sys-
tems amounts to over one hundred and ten million
dollars per year.
Our military engineers were the pioneers in the
construction and operation of many of our great
utilities such as the Baltimore and Ohio, New York,
New Haven and Hartford, the Union Pacific and
other railways. These achievements led the Czar of
Russia to select an American army engineer to build
the railroad from St. Petersburg to Moscow.
Army engineers were the pioneers in canal con-
struction in this country. They built the old Chesa-
peake and Ohio Canal, the Erie and Panama Canals.
They are charged with the execution of river and
harbor improvements and many other duties of
national importance. Army engineers were the
pioneers in the development of geodetic, topo-
graphic and hydrographic surveying. The army
organized the Weather Bureau and operated it for
many years.
Army engineers built the Washington Monument
and many of the public buildings in Washington.
The army has initiated and helped to develop
many of our great industries. Our Ordnance en-
gineers developed the steel industry. They intro-
duced alloy steels in this country. They revolu-
tionized industry by the introduction in 179S of the
idea of interchangeability of parts in machinery.
An Ordnance officer established the method of
shipping high explosives now used by our transpor-
tation lines. The Ordnance Department has played
an important part in developing our Nitrate in-
dustry.
Our Chemical Warfare Service has adapted the
gas mask to many civil pursuits and is also devoting
its energies to the application of gases and chemi-
cals to sanitary and agricultural purposes. Gases
have been developed to kill rodents and insects.
Results have been accomplished in cooperation with
the Department of Agriculture in fighting the boll
weevil and other crop destroyers.
The Air Service, now the weakest part of our
national defense due to its inadequate' size, is rend-
ering valuable aid in the development of commercial
aviation and in protecting our forests against fire.
It is also cooperating with the Department of Agri-
culture in the development of means of spraying
orchards and growing crops.
Many other accomplishments of the army not in
the engineering line could be mentioned at length,

Fatigue'' of Metals and the Basic Assumptions of
Mechanics of Materials
By PROFESSOR H. F. MOORE,* University of Illinois
A MOXG the most startling accidents which
•**• occur to structures and machines are those
which occur to metal parts under stress which is
repeated again and again. Perhaps the most strik-
ing example of this kind of accident is furnished
by the occasional failure of a car axle or locomotive
axle. A car axle is a "live" axle and is subjected to
reversed bending stress: as the axle revolves the
stress in any fiber changes from compression to
tension as the position of the fiber moves from top
to bottom of the axle. After watching the failure

of a steel specimen in tension tests, or, the slow
buckling of a steel column under an excessive load,
it is natural to expect that the steel axle will bend
a great deal before it breaks, yet this does not
occur; the axle snaps off, and the fracture usually
has a jagged "crystalline" appearance. So marked
is this appearance that about the middle of the
19th century, when such failures first began to be
noticed, it was commonly supposed that under re-
peated stress, the steel developed a crystalline struc-
ture. The term "crystallization" came into common
use, and is still used, although the metallurgical
microscope has shown us that steel is always crys-
talline and that ordinarily steel does not change its
crystalline structure under the action of repeated
stress.
This breakdown of steel under repeated stress
suggested an analogv with muscular fatigue in the
body, and as the crystalline theory was discredited
by the advent of the microscope in steel testing, the
name "fatigue" failure came to be generally applied.
This name is scarcely more appropriate than the
name "crystallization." Muscular fatigue is repaired
by rest, and there is no evidence that the spreading
cracks, which bring about fatigue failures in metals,
are repaired by rest.
The advent of the metallurgical microscope and
its application to the study of steel has given us a
new viewpoint of this phenomenon of "fatigue"
failure and has forced us to recognize the approxi-
mate nature of the assumptions on which the whole
science of mechanics of materials is built. Under
the microscope, materials are seen to be made up,
not of homogeneous material, but of an aggregation
of irregular crystalline grains with fairly well de-
fined boundaries. Most metals are composed of two
or more different kinds of crystalline grains, usually
of varying hardness and strength. \X hen stress
is applied to a metal at first the general appear-
ance of these crystalline grains is not changed,

At a stress somewhat below that at which the
elastic limit is ordinarily found, some of the crys-
talline grains appear to split into thin plates which
slide on each other, something like a pile of loose
boards. If a steady load is continued still fur-

ther, the surface of the metal begins to wrinkle,
as is shown by the appearance of shadows in the
"valleys" of the surface as seen under the micro-
scope. If instead of a steady load, being applied,
repeated load is applied to the metal, the slip lines
between the sliding plates, increase in number and
distinctness and if the stressing be violent enough,
cracks frequently open and extend right through
crystals and spread. Such cracks are shown in fig-
ure 1. These cracks may well be compared to
minute hacksaw cuts which gradually spread
through the cross-section of the piece, subjected to
repeated stress.
This progressive failure explains the suddenness
of fatigue failure. If a piece of metal is watched
as it is cut in two by a power hacksaw it will be
noted that there is very little apparent deformation
of the piece until the saw cut is nearly finished,
then it fails quite suddenly. In the same way for
a piece subjected to progressive spreading of cracks,
no corresponding evidence of these cracks is given
by observation of the piece until it is nearly ready
to fail.
The relation between the actual spreading cracks
in progressive failure and the slip lines between
plates in a crystal is not altogether clear. There
are cases, notably that of pure iron, in which a con-
siderable amount of slipping occurs without the
development of spreading crack and progressive
failure. On the other hand, in certain non-ferrous
metals, fatigue failure has occurred under stresses
at which there was evidence of the slipping within
crystals. The whole matter of the relation of slip
lines to spreading constitutes a field in which com-
paratively little exploration has been done.
If we adopt the assumption as to atomic struc-
tures of crystalline metals which is held by phy-
sical chemists today, we shall recognize that with-
in crystalline grains the atoms are arranged in regu-
lar geometrical patterns and at the grain boundar-
ies the patterns for adjacent grains do not "per-
fectly" match, and that there is a thin layer of
irregularly arranged atoms constituting an "amor-
phous" film. This regular geometrical arrangement
of atoms within the crystal is called the space lat-
tice of the metal. Under light stress, the space lat-
tice is slightly distorted but no change in the plan
of arrangement of atoms takes place. Under stress
which causes slip, some bonds between adjacent
atoms are broken, but the atoms, or at least most
of the atoms, establish new bonds with new part-
ners and these bonds, especially after a little time
has been allowed for adjustment, may be as strong
or even stronger than the original bonds between
atoms. If a crack occurs, bonds between atoms are
broken and new bonds are not established.
The above picture has been presented as if inten-
sity of stress were not affected by slips and cracks.
As a matter of fact the intensity of stress existing is
very clearly affected by such actions as slip and the
starting of cracks. It has been long recognized by
elasticians that if in a homogeneous material there
should be an absolutely sharp re-entrant angle, such
as a sharp notch in an axle, the intensity of stress
at the root of that notch under any load, however
small, would approach infinity. It has been recog-
nized that at the roots of actual cracks, notches,
tool marks, screw threads, etc. there are minute
areas of very high intensity of stress. These local-
ized stresses are not considered at all in developing
the ordinary formulas in mechanics of materials.
At a crack in a crystalline grain there must be local-
ized stress such as is found at cracks in the surface
of metal. This presence of localized stress in the
end of the crack explains why the cracks are self-
spreading under repeated stress.
The statement of the falsity of the basic assump-
tions of homogeneous materials, on which our en-
tire science of materials rests appears at first to be
a very revolutionary suggestion. When, however,
we consider the significance of the small localized
stress, we come to the conclusion that we are by
no means ready to abandon our old time proven
formulas or mechanics, but that we must realize
that they have distinct limitations. In this they are
not different from other working formulas of en-
gineering. The formulas of mechanics of materials
have been developed mainly by civil engineers.
Civil engineering has dealt mainly with structures
subject to steady loads, or to comparatively few
repetitions of load. The consideration of localized
stress and spreading cracks in such structures is
of minor importance. If a microscopic crack forms,
but is subjected to merely a few hundred repetitions
of stress, it probably will not spread sufficiently to
do any damage. Looking at structural importance
in a "statistical" way, viewing the millions of crys-
talline grains as the life insurance expert views
the millions of individuals carrying insurance, we
see that our ordinary formulas of mechanics of
materials give us a view of the behavior of a struc-
tural part. Just as the life insurance expert can-
not predict the time of death of any individual, but
can predict with reasonable accuracy, the number
of deaths which will occur in a year among a million
individuals, so the ordinary formulas of mechanics
of materials cannot predict the stress at the be-
ginning of slipping of minute fractures for any given
crystalline grain, but can predict stress at the gen-
eral vielding of a structural part as a whole.
When we consider machine parts, subject to re-
peated stress, localized stress becomes much more

Should Technical Education be Ameliorated?*
By Professor William S. Franklin
Professor of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
I am sure that my article on "Amelioration" in
this issue of Technic will only serve to strengthen
a mistaken idea in the minds of some of your
readers. Any one who likes to believe that the
study of science is unredeemably dry and exacting
will be encouraged in the belief; but every good
sport will read between the lines.
The greatest fault in a person of serious purpose
is to take himself too seriously; to think to himself
of himself, "How virtuous am I; who do things
with no fun in them." But nothing worth while
is ever done except for fun! Be a good sport!
W. S. F.
Most of my life has been spent as a teacher in
the technical school, and teaching is great fun in
spite of. or, I should say in all honesty, partly be-
cause of delinquent students and their softened
fathers and tearful mothers. From their point of
view technical education certainly should be amelio-
rated. How often I have faced a real condition
with a young man only to have him and his fond
parents assume that a favor on my part would alter
or even greatly mitigate the stern facts of the case!
A sense of humor alone, is sufficient to fortify a
teacher in such a position; but, alas, much more
than a sense of humor is needed to keep a teacher
sane in face of the widespread abhorrence among
civilized men for every kind of ordeal or test or trial
of young men. No one would wish to go back to
the practice of savages in dealing with young men,
but the point of view of the "softies" is hopeless.
There is, of course, a very real constraint in the
technical school, and the unmistakable distress
which grows out of this constraint is by no means
confined to our less determined students and their
over-indulgent parents.
The worst thing about it, as I know too well, is
that it fosters an illusion of laborious study. I have
known many students to fail because they could
not, in their opinion, be expected to carry on in so
strenuous an undertaking, and yet I have never
known an engineering student, one not earning his
own living, whose work was half as hard in fact as
in his imagination or one-tenth as hard as the sym-
pathetic members of his family thought it to be.
A very small part of the distress among engineer-
ing students comes from the fact that a few of them
are not at all adapted to mathematical studies. More
than fifty per cent of those who enter our engineer-
ing schools drop out before graduation, and if this
high mortality were due to essential non-adaptabil-
*Reprint from Tech Engineering News
ity, it would be a serious thing; but in the great
majority of cases it is unqualified perversity, not
mental deficiency, that is the cause of the mortality.
But one should not use the word mortality in this
connection, for many young men have been killed
by being kept in college and no young man has ever
yet been killed by being "kicked out." Nor should
one speak of unqualified perversity, for it is the
God-given privilege of young men to go their own
way. No, we should not speak of perversity but
merely of unwillingness to study and to think. Even
so, it is life itself that must draw up the indictment;
not one who knows the pains of those who really
learn and the grief of those who are wise!
A great deal of distress among engineering stu-
dents comes from the curtailment of normal in-
stinctive activities which is inevitable when the en-
ergies of young men are largely devoted to serious
study. Always, we must expect to find an under-
current of melancholy among husky young men
who cannot hunt and fish and play, and make love
all of the time. What a wonderful field in which to
make use of literature and poetry! For the fine arts,
and especially literature and poetry, are useful be-
cause they alone can keep us moderns from revert-
ing to outright savagery.
"Ernst ist das Leben, heiter ist die Kunst."
The older form of this saying is that life is
short and somewhat empty; whereas art is long;
but Goethe would have us understand that life is
only serious and trying, whereas art is a flowing
river of comfort and good cheer.
If I were a teacher of English in a technical
school, I would expend most of my energies in a
fine-arts emphasis on literature. However, technical
education needs such amelioration no more than
college education, for to deaden imaginative appre-
ciation by over-much routine work is no worse than
to let it be killed by sheer laziness. I would try to
stimulate resourcefulness in recreation among my
students. It is a popular belief that resourcefulness
in recreation among college students is far above
the dismal American averages, but it is not so. Our
college students do, of course, have their rooting;
and I look to see the college graduate of the future
meet every crisis in life as he learns to meet the
crisis on the gridiron—by jumping up and down
and yelling.
Consider the wonderful capacity of the Wild In-


November, 1923
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
dian for long continued and strenuous effort in hunt-
ing, fishing, and raiding. Surely the Indian is not
as lazy as he appears to be in his Agency Home on
a Reservation! And every one knows that our
young men are not stupid, although it is as difficult
to persuade young men to study as it is to persuade
Agency Indians to plow, and for exactly the same
reason. Studying, and especially the studying of
science, is as new to us as plowing is to Indians.
The great grandfathers of most of our college stu-
dents could not even read or write, and it is absurd
to expect college boys to study because they like to
study or because they have an instinctive apprecia-
tion of the necessity of studying. No, carrying-on
in college must depend mainly on the will-to-study
based on a conviction of its necessity, and this con-
viction must come from the friendly counsel of old-
er men and be reenforced by a sustained demand on
the part of the college.
But, many people ask, is study, especially the
study of science, a necessity? Certainly not, if there
is any alternative; and, of course, there is an alter-
native. Imagine a never-to-be-escaped human need
of a twenty-foot arm. What age-long development
and what infinite pains! It is easier to build a steam
shovel. This no one will deny, and it means that
mankind is now bent decidedly, for better or for
worse, toward what has been called social-inheri-
tance as opposed to organic inheritance; but social
inheritance has its pains, too, as many know who
burn the midnight oil.
"Woe to those who are young!"
It is a common belief that youth means only care-
free joy, but this blissful state is for childhood only.
The divine quality of youth is not freedom from
care but enthusiasm, and as enthusiasm has in the
past led young men to the terrible sacrifices of
war, so enthusiasm alone can lead men to accept
the increasing burdens of preparation and training
which the new kind of war, called civilization, de-
mands. Woe to those who are young!
How shocking to substitute a materialistic love
of steam shovels for a tender-minded love of science
for its own sake, and to make study appear as a
dire necessity rather than a pure delight! But study
is a distressing thing to most young men. Let us
face the facts for nothing but facts can help us in
our dealings with young men. You can fool all of
the people part of the time and part of the people
all of the time, so it is said; but our young men,
they never can be fooled at all.
But, many people ask, is an exacting constraint
really necessary in the teaching of science? It cer-
tainly is; constraint and not a little coercion. It
would be a great boon to education if some clear
understanding of this fact could be given to all men.
Everyone feels the constraint which is placed on
the lives of men by the physical necessities of the
world in which we live, and although in one way
this constraint is relieved by the advancement of
the sciences, in another way it grows ever more and
more exacting. It is indeed easier to cross the
Atlantic Ocean now than it was in Lief Ericsson's
time; but consider the discipline of the shop, and
above all consider the rules of machine design!
Even the hardy Norsemen never knew anything as
uncompromisingly exacting as these.
Every person with whom I have ever talked, old
or young, theorist or practician, student-in-general
or specialist in whatever line, has exhibited more or
less distinctly an attitude of impatience towards
the exactions of this or that phase of the precise
modes of thought of the mathematical sciences.
"There, alas, the spirit is constrained, and laced
in Spanish corslets."
It is no wonder that easy-going believers in liber-
al education have always looked with horror on the
sciences, as very much softened men and women look
upon work. Liberalism means freedom, and "liber-
alism in education is the freedom of development in
each individual of that character and personality
which is his true nature." This I accept in a spirit
of optimism, believing men's true natures to be
good; but there is a phase of education which has
but little to do directly with character and personal-
ity, and I call attention to this conception of liberal-
ism in education in order that I may turn sharply
away from it as an incomplete conception which to
a great extent excludes the sciences. There is a con-
dition in education which is the antithesis of free-
dom; for the teaching of the sciences is a mode of
constraint, a constructive discipline without which
no freedom is possible in our dealings with physical
conditions and things. The study of elementary
science is a reorganization of the workaday mind of
a young man, as complete as the pupation of an in-
sect, and an exacting constraint is the essential con-
dition of this reorganization.
There is a kind of salamander, the axolotl, which
lives a tadpole-like youth and never changes to the
adult form unless a stress of dry weather annihilates
his watery world. Ordinarily he lives always and
reproduces his kind as a tadpole, and a very funny-
looking tadpole he is, with his lungs hanging as
featherv tassels from the sides of his head; when the
aquatic home of the axolotl dries up, however, he
quickly develops a pair of internal lungs, lops off
his tassels and embarks on a new mode of life on
land.
Something not wholly unlike the change that
overturns the world of the axolotl seems lately to
have come upon the world of men, for our modern
age of science and organized industry is like a stu-
pendous drought in its effect on the fine arts and on
all the fine old wavs of life. Millions of men do


Page 21
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
indeed continue to live as tadpoles, not very con-
tentedly, it is true, and those who develop beyond
the tadpole stage do so because they meet the great
stress of dryness with a quick and responsive in-
ward growth. The study of science is td a very
great extent an "inward growth" or what we may
call "making up one's mind" in the sense of putting
one's mind in order. It is the setting up of exact
definitions, the formulation of precise ideas, and
the building up of elaborate points of view. Noth-
ing is so essential in the acquirement of scientific
knowledge as the possession of precise ideas be-
cause nothing else so effectually opens the mind for
the perception of the simplest evidences of a subject.
The necessity of precise ideas! Herein lies the
impossibility of compromise and the necessity of
constraint. One must think so and so, there is no
other way. And yet there is always a conflict in
the mind even of the most willing student because
of the narrowing influence which precise ideas exer-
cise over our vivid and primitively adequate sense
of physical things. This conflict is perennial, and
it is by no means a one-sided conflict between mere
crudity and refinement, because refinement ignores
many things. Precise ideas not only help to form
our sense of the world in which we live, but they
inhibit sense as well, and their complete and un-
challenged rule would indeed be a stress of dryness.
"All theory, my friend, is somber, gray;
And only the tree of life is green."
An extremely remarkable thing in science is that
highly complex and penetrating interpretations are
forced upon the almost unthinkably meager data
which we obtain directly through our senses. An
astronomer, for example, looks at a speck of light
as it crosses the field of his telescope and he listens
to the beats of a clock, noting the time of day when
the speck of light crosses the center of the field.
He then looks at a set of finely engraved lines on a
divided circle, noting the angular distance, of the
speck of light above the horizon. All this he does
three times in succession. Then, proceeding to in-
terpret his data, he calculates when the speck of
light (a comet) will be nearest the sun, how far it
will then be from the sun, how fast it will be mov-
ing, and when it will return, perhaps a hundred
years hence. This kind of forced interpretation is
very common in physics and chemistry, and in most
cases the actual sense data are so extremely meager
that to layman they seem to be absurdly inade-
quate.
Another equally remarkable thing in the physical
sciences is that we have learned to exercise over
physical things a kind of rational control which
greatly transcends the cunning of the most skillful
hand.
Francis Bacon long ago listed in his quaint way
the things which seemed to him most needful for
the advancement of human knowledge or power,
and, among other things, he mentioned "A New
Engine or a help to the mind corresponding to tools
for the hand"; and the most important aspect of
the modern mathematical sciences is the aspect in
which they constitute a realization of Bacon's idea.
These sciences do certainly constitute a New En-
gine which helps the mind as a tool helps the hand,
and it is this Engine which makes possible all forced
interpretation and all rational control.
This New Engine is in part a mechanical struc-
ture. Consider, for example, the carefully planned
arrangement of apparatus which is set up and used
in any experimental study in the laboratory or in
making any kind of engineering test. Experimen-
tal data which are in themselves as meager as the
astronomer's data take on meaning and bear a com-
plex interpretation very largely because of this ar-
rangement of apparatus. Or consider the carefully
planned series of operations of solution, reaction,
filtering, drying, and weighing, such as is always
carried out in chemical studies and tests. The ex-
perimental data of the chemist are as meager as the
astronomer's data and they take on meaning and
bear a complex interpretation very largely because
of the carefully planned operations, and, of course,
a carefully planned group of operations is essen-
tially a mechanical structure.
The New Engine is also in part a logical struc-
ture, that is to say, a closely reasoned body of
mathematical and conceptual theory.
These two structures do indeed constitute a new
engine, and the teaching of the physical sciences is
the building of this engine: (a) By developing the
logical structure of the sciences in the mind of the
young man, (b) by training in the use of instru-
ments and in the performance of ordered opera-
tions, and (c) by exercises in the application of
these things to the phenomena of physics and chem-
istry at every step and all the time with every pos-
sible variation.
That certainly is an exacting program, and the
only alternative is to place the student under the
instruction of Jules Verne where nothing is to be
done. There the student need not be troubled by
exactions, but he can follow his teacher pleasantly
on a care-free trip to the moon, or with easy im-
providence embark on a voyage of twenty thousand
leagues under the sea!
"Superiority to fate
Is difficult to learn,
'Tis not conferred by any,
But possible to earn

Until, to her surprise,
The soul, with strict economy,
Subsists till paradise."

The most distressing idolatry the world has ever
known is the modern, popular science-worship
which pays no tithes and takes no pains. It is our
Great Religion. Its catechism is science teaching
which abhors exactions; its litany is the semi-serious
wail of regret of our easier college graduates that
a silver-spoon smartness was not transmitted by a
pleasant college course into what they conceive
the talents of its priesthood to be; and its creed is
the belief of every would-be parasite who thinks
exaltingly that science is the building of steamships
to carry him where he has no need to go, of rail-
ways to bring him things he could better do without,
and of airplanes to carry quickly his letters which
would not lose in meaning if their time of transit
were to take a thousand years. Most people think
of science in terms of results, chiefly, indeed, of
results which facilitate joy-riding of all kinds, in-
cluding easy orgies of near thinking. And these are
the Beatitudes! Blessed is the joy-rider, for he
shall not run amuck! Blessed is the nation of joy-
riders, for it will stand—until the next great war.
In view of such bliss it is, of course, absurd to
count humanistic things such as literature and art
as safeguards against reversion to savagery.
No! Science is Finding Out and Learning How.
Its greatest gift to those of us who live inside of
its frontiers is an understanding of the things which
surround us and of the things we have to do; and
its price is pains.
Science is finding out and learning how, but its
results have fascinated the crowd, who, neither pay-
ing nor achieving, adopt a scale of material values
for everything in life with a consequent neglect of
human quality and a denial of human value in
everything. We have a wisdom of easy plausibili-
ties, a religion of mechanical beatitudes, a theology
of universal indulgences, a jurisprudence which will
hang no rogues. All of which means that we can-
not discern worth or unworth in anything, and least
of all in men; whereas nature and heaven command
us, at our peril, to distinguish worth from unworth
in everything and most of all in men. Our real
problem now, as always, is "Who is best man?"
and the fates forgive much—forgive the wildest,
fiercest, and crudest experiments, if fairly made in
the settling of that question. Theft and blood guilti-
ness are not pleasing to the gods, and yet the favor-
ing powers of the material and spiritual worlds will
confirm to you your stolen goods and the noblest
of voices will applaud the lifting of your spear if
only your robbing and slaying have been done in
fair arbitrament of the question "Who is best man?"
But if we refuse such inquiry we come at last to
face the same question wrong side upwards, and
our robbing and slaying must then be done to find
out "Who is worst man?" which, in our wide order
of inverted merit, is a difficult question, and its
decision is a Denial:

such as the achievements of the Medical Corps in
the elimination of yellow fever and tropical dis-
eases, the eradication of typhoid and other diseases
which formerly ravaged the armies of the world.
All these and the campaign against social diseases
have had a marked effect upon our population. The
army has always gone to the assistance of the popu-

gencies, such as fires, floods and internal disorders.
Aid has been rendered the peoples of other coun-
tries in times of famine and earthquake.
Contrary to enormous reports only 13.5 per cent
of the Federal Budget is spent for national defense
and the army is now as in the past paying a large
dividend to our people for every dollar expended
by the War Department. The peace time activities
of the army not only render great public service but
keep it prepared for its duties in national emer-
gencies.

On Sketching
By Eugene T. Cleland, '24A
MOST men have some hobby besides their regu- To be able to sketch rapidly and well in the
lar work in which they take a great deal of drafting room requires considerable practice and
pleasure. It may be some game, or radio, or other study out of doors. Copying some one else's work
side-line in which the cares of life are cast off and is uninteresting and less instructive than out-door
they enjoy what they best like to do. Sketching sketching because you lose the joy of tramping and
from nature seems the natural thing for an architect have no chance to express your own individuality,
to select for his hobby since his training fits him for No two men see the same subject in the same man-
it to some extent and
because it is akin to his
profession. A great
amount of pleasure is
derived from sketching
which grows with the
progress you make, be-

sides this it manifests itself in your work and your
ability to judge your own work increases.
The molding of your taste depends a great deal
upon the subjects you choose to sketch. The archi-
tect naturally turns to buildings when he starts out
to hunt a subject. Of course the locality dictates
to some extent what your sketches shall be. If
good examples of architecture surround you, your
knowledge of detail will be enlarged by sketching
them, or you may be more artistically inclined and
decide to hunt for some old picturesque spot where
dilapidation exists. The latter will invariably have
more charm and be more interesting to sketch.
Again, if you wish to venture into the realm of
the artist, you will forsake buildings entirely and
study the growth of trees and landscape com-
position.
But no matter which you choose to do, stick to
it until you have achieved some success. Invite
criticism, for it is hard to pick the flaws in your
own work. Try different mediums until you find
the one you like to work with the best and which
gives you the best results.
Do not become discouraged with your first at-
tempts but keep in mind that the men whose
sketches you admire achieved their success only
after long and diligent effort. Your success may
not equal that of professionals but nevertheless you
will reap pleasure and profit from your experience
and will not regret the time you have spent. At
least try a few sketches. You may discover you
have talent, and if you have, do not hide it under
a bushel.
ELIEL SAARINEN
It has been the very good fortune of the Archi-
tectural Department to secure as visiting professor
of the year, Eliel Saarinen, the architect from Hel-
singfors, Finland, who attracted more attention by
getting second place in the recent Chicago Tribune
Competition than if he had taken first. It was his
design that caused the many controversies as to
whether the jury demanded a home grown product
for a design or whether the winning design was the
best.
Up to the time of the competition Eliel Saarinen
Was known only to a few individuals in the pro-
fession. He was an unknown figure to the average
layman. It is quite true that in Europe his work had
attracted quite some attention due its great orig-
inality and clear way of execution, but no, or at
least very little mention, was ever made of him
here.
He was born on August 20, 1873. In 1896 he
settled in Helsingfors for the practice of architec-
ture and a short nine years later he entered the
Competition for the Palace of the Peace at the
Hague. Out of a number of designs well over two
hundred which were submitted, only forty were
kept for the final judging and Mr. Saarinen's was
among these. In looking at the drawing one is
immediately struck by the feeling that his work
there already evidenced the same characteristics
which are now so dominant in his work.
He is a firm believer in mass as contrasted to
detail. This is not to say that detail has no part
in his work but the mass is the overpowering thing.
And the mass has a feeling of immenseness about
it. Even his smallest statue, or decoration, seems
large. And yet all is in perfect scale. One almost
thinks that Mr. Saarinen could never conceive of
anything small or mean.
He looks to no school of which he may be a
disciple. His work has a sense of the modern about
it, which is by far more pleasing than some of the
many things which pass for modern but which
really are but sad attempts. His delimit is in hand-
ling large blank wall areas, which however are far
from being uninteresting. Lack of cornices is
also an outstanding feature, but this is marked the
most in his tall buildings. Irving K. Pond says of
him that his architecture is one which is not spelled
in terms of columns and conventionality. And this
about sums the man up. Extremely original and
handling this originality in a way that pleases, he
is bound by no conventions. Conventions are minor
details to him. If anyone had said that a Capitol
of a state could be built in any way outside of a
classical motive he would have been laughed at.
An architect, however, with more foresight than the
rest, showed some of Mr. Saarinen's work to the
commission on the Nebraska State capitol and the
result is an entirely new conception.
Mr. Saarinen in coming here will teach and criti-
cize advanced and graduate design and his coming
will spell another red letter day in the history of
the school.
NEW MEMBERS OF THE ENGINEERING
COLLEGE TEACHING STAFF
Mr. Alex L. Trout comes to the College of Archi-
tecture as Instructor in Architectural Design. He
received his preparatory education in the Detroit
schools and in 1905 was graduated from the Uni-
versity of Michigan. In addition to four years' pri-
vate engineering practice, Mr. Trout has been em-
ployed in various capacities by Whitehead and
Kales and the Structural Iron Works of Detroit,
the Smith Gas Power Company, and by Lewis
Kahn. He was in charge of the design of the Ford
Detroit and Philadelphia service stations, the Louis-
ville National Theater, the Detroit Athletic Club.
Southeastern High School, and the Vernor and
Lafer Buildings of Detroit.
During the World War Mr. Trout served about


Page 25

eighteen months as Captain in the army, being
overseas more than a year of this time. Since then
he has been engaged in field surveys in connection
with planning the town of Marysville, Michigan.
He has held offices in several of the Engineering
Societies of Detroit and is now a member of the
American Association of Engineers and American
Society of Military Engineers.
Mr. A. G. Pelikan has been engaged to fill the
vacancy of Mr. E. H. Barnes in the Architectural
College. Mr. Pelikan was graduated from the Car-
negie Institute of Technology and also received a
special diploma from the Bukshin Summer School
of Art. His post graduate work was done at Colum-
bia University. He was a member of the Kent
Scientific Museum Expedition making collections of
primitive art in the Sandwich and Navigation Is-
lands in the Pacific Ocean.
Mr. Pelikan comes from the Grand Rapids School
of Art and Industry where he was director and will
teach courses in decorative design.
THE PASSING OF WEST HALL
On the evening of November 16 about midnight a
motley array of architects dressed in the garb of
their profession and the principal figures dressed as
Greeks, assembled in the Engineering Quadrangle
and prepared to execute a ritual such as has never
been seen on this Campus before. The mysticness
of the ancient Druids was paled by the performance
which was staged by the assembled group. Garbed
in smocks and carrying lighted torches and candles
and wearing high cornucopias, some as high as
four feet, the group presented a weird appearance
as they formed their line of march and proceeded
to march solemnly down South University Street,
headed by a band which played solemn music and
mournful dirges. The band was headed by a
solemn faced drum major who carried with stately
mien a large baton on which was a draped "A."
The band was followed by the cloaked architects
and the flickering torches made the scene quite
gruesome in its mysteriousness. High on the
shoulders of six stalwarts was carried the image of
Apollo. An effigy of West Hall was carried by
two young Greeks. Following the God came his
high priest with his cortege.
The procession slowly wended its way to the
President's house where he was invoked to come
and mourn with the wailing procession. As the
procession swung into State Street the Architect's
flag was unfurled and carried by a stalwart young
Greek. With still more solemn step the cortege
approached the place where West Hall had once
proudly raised itself. The procession formed itself
into a circle and the many spectators who had
gathered formed a circle about five deep.
The high priest read a funeral oration the like
of which has never been heard before with the pos-
sible exception of Mark Antony's famous one at
the death of Caesar. It was a heart rending appeal
about the unglorious past of West Hall. The fun-
eral pyre was then lit and as the flames caught the
wood the priest invoked the God and Lo! he came
to life. Words of wisdom from his ruby lips and
the scene was suddenly changed from one of in-
tense sorrow to one of intense joy. However the
retinue of the priest performed their dance of death
to awe inspiring music of a slightly Turkish origin
and the God continued to rejoice at the demolition
of West Hall. The effigy was carried about the
fire and as it was placed on the pyre a distant "taps"
was sounded and the flames embraced the last
earthly remnants of a once mighty structure. The
God gleefully sprang down from his throne and
forgetting his associates high on Olympus he
capered gleefully around the fire in celebration of
the burning pile. He danced blithely to the soft
and inspiring strains of that great classic, "Yes, we
have no bananas" and the retinue of the priest
joined him. The high priest burst forth into loud
shouts of approval at the burning of the model. The
God suddenly disappeared, no doubt to Olympus,
and the procession headed by the Choregus and his
band left again to the world of reality. The God
will repose on Olympus until another architectural
mistake is consigned to the future when he will
again appear and make merry with his priests and
followers.
THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS
"Westward the course of Empire takes its way,"
and to all appearances the architectural department
is included in the word Empire. Due to the great
increase in enrollment in the school it has been
found necessary to utilize a part of the old Engin-
eering Shops and transform them into drafting
rooms. These rooms are connected to the archi-
tectural wing by a wooden bridge which has been
called the "Bridge of Sighs." The reason is obvious
when it is said that such things as Descriptive
Geometry will be taught in the new addition. But in
spite of this the Architects are, one of these days,
going to dedicate the bridge in a fitting and proper
manner and no doubt the Campus will have the
pleasure of witnessing a christening on a large scale.
We only hope that those who pass over the bridge
will not suffer the same unkind fate as those who
were escorted across the original Sighing Bridge.
Stranger: "Please, sir, how can I find the lib-
rary?"
Senior: "See that girl ahead of you, all dressed
up and no books under her arms? Well, just follow
her."

William Sound, to the Kennecott Copper Mines at
Kennecott, a distance of 196 miles. Its principal
function is the haulage of high grade copper ore
from the mines to the coast for ocean shipment to
a smelter in the States. At Chitina, Mile 130, the
Richardson Highway connects the railroad with the
upper Copper River Valley and the interior, north
of the Alaska Range.
The White Pass &amp; Yukon Route extends from
Skagway, a port at the head of Lynn Canal on the
Inside Passage of southeastern Alaska, to White
Horse in Yukon Territory, a distance of 112 miles
(only 20 miles in Alaska). At White Horse, con-
nection is made with river boats during the open
season of navigation which operate to Dawson, the
distributing center of the Klondike District, and on
down the Yukon River to Tanana, and then up the
Tanana to Nenana. Silver-lead ore, mined at Mayo,
up the Stewart River above Dawson, is carried by
this line to Nenana where it is delivered to The
Alaska Railroad.
The Seward Peninsula Railroad from Nome to
Shelton, 87 miles of narrow gauge, ceased operation
as a common carrier about 10 years ago. Last year
it was purchased by the Territory and turned over
to the Alaska Road Commission for operation
as a public tram and highway. It has been rehabili-
tated by the Alaska Road Commission and is being
operated with cars drawn by dogs.
MEASURING HIGH TEMPERATURES
A new type of pyrometer has superseded the opti-
cal pyrometer in the cement industry, and is des-
tined to displace it in other fields where similar high
temperatures are measured. The "radiation pyro-
meter," as it is called, is operated similarly to the
optical pyrometer in that the observer sights
through it at the spot whose temperature he wishes
to measure.
The radiation pyrometer differs, however, from
the optical type in that instead of the operator
matching colors of the wire with the hot point un-
der observation, the telescope in the new type of
instrument focuses the rays of light emanating from
the hot point upon the wire in the pyrometer. The
wire then expands, and moves a needle in the
indicator box, which reveals the temperature under
observation. This instrument practically eliminates
the "personal equation" from the work, and hence
is more accurate than the optical pyrometer.

Additions to Engineering College Teaching Staff
In Professor John Stephen Worlev, the Civil En-
gineering Department has secured the services of
a man of wide experience and practice. He was born
and received his preparatory education in Odessa,
Missouri. He attended Odessa College and the
University of Missouri for a year and a half and
then entered the Engineering College of the Uni-
versity of Kansas from which school he was grad-
uated with his Bachelor's and Master's degree in
Civil Engineering. In connection with his engineer-
ing work, he studied law and was admitted to the
Missouri Bar in 1919.
Professor Worlev has been identified with the
construction and operation of several mid-western
and southern railroads and traction lines, among
which are the Kansas City, Mexico &amp; Orient R. R.
in Texas; the Little Rock &amp; Fort Sumter in Arkan-
sas, and the St. Louis &amp; Arkansas R. R. While in
Toledo he was Principal Assistant Engineer in com-
pleting the Toledo Urban and Interurban Railroad,
and was assigned from them to the location, con-
struction, and preliminary operation of the Marion,
Bluffton, and Eastern Traction Company in In-
diana.
Professor Worley has close connections with sev-
eral large banks and trust companies of New York
City. He represented the Manhattan Trust Com-
pany in an accounting case with the Georgia In-
come Bond Company. For seven years he was a
member of the Engineering Board of the Interstate
Commerce Commission in charge of the evaluation
of railroad properties in the United States. In 1920
he was appointed representative of several banks
in the management of the Habirshaw Electric Cable
Company and later was placed in full charge of
their four plants and ten thousand men.
Among the fraternities and clubs of which Pro-
fessor Worley is a member are Tau Beta Pi, Ameri-
can Society of Civil Engineers, the Cosmos Club of
Washington, and the University of Kansas Club.

Mr. B. F. Dostal, a graduate of the University of
Wisconsin, is teaching several courses in mathe-
matics. He received his Master's degree at the Uni-
versity of Indiana and has done graduate work at
the University of Chicago. Mr. Dostal saw ser-
vice in the World War.
Mr. L. H. Donnell, instructor in the department
of Engineering Mechanics, was graduated from the
University of Michigan in 1915. For two years
following graduation he was an engineering ap-
prentice with the H. H. Franklin Co. of Syracuse,
N. Y. Since the war he has been with the Packard
Motor Car Co. of Detroit as a draughtsman and
with the Dodge Brothers in charge of computing
and design analysis.

Captain G. W. Dunn, a new instructor in the
R. O. T. C, is filling the vacancy left by Captain
Faust. He studied Civil Engineering at Columbia
University and before the war he was employed in
general surveying on the Seventh Avenue subway,
New York City and in prospecting for metals in
Tennessee and Virginia for the New Jersey Zinc
Company. In May 1917 Captain Dunn entered the
Plattsburg Officers Training Camp, received a com-
mission in August and sailed for France in Septem-
ber of the same year. Overseas he was assigned
as Orienteur of the 1st Battalion of the 52nd Ar-
tillery. Since the war, Captain Dunn has been
stationed at Fort Caswell, North Carolina and at
the Coast Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Vir-
ginia.
First Engineering Smoker Immense Success
The first smoker this year of the Engineering
Society was held at the Union on the evening of
October 9th. The speaker of the evening, Colonel
Manus McCloskey, was introduced by Dean Cooley
and gave a most interesting talk, first outlining the
present military organization of the United States
and afterward recounting some of his personal ex-
periences in the army both before and during the
war. Several orchestra selections were given and
Carl Boswell sang. Tang and Tavares concluded
the program by playing some of their excellent
Hawaiian numbers.
The Educational Building
The Model High School section of the Education-
al building is receiving the finishing touches of the
contractor. It will be much patterned after, by many
cities of the state because it represents the last
word in high school construction.
The Building Program
The year ending December 31, 1923, may be
hailed as the most progressive period in the history
of the University, as far as improving the Educa-
tional facilities is concerned. During this year, five
very essential buildings will be completed and
equipped for occupancy. Those who were not in
Ann Arbor during the past summer, missed a very
impressive sight on our campus. At one time there
were four steam shovels moving earth to make way
for various projects which were in progress. East
and South University Avenues were blocked by
piles of building materials and earth which was be-
ing removed from the trench for the construction of
the heat and conduit tunnels. To hasten the com-
pletion of the New Engineering Laboratories a
steam shovel was used to clean up the waste mater-
ials which had accumulated between the wings dur-
ing its construction. The same steam shovel placed
the remains of West Hall on trucks which hauled
them to their final resting place.
Clements Library
The first structure to be completed was The
Clements Library of American History. This is
without doubt the most artistic building on the
campus. The interior finish more than justifies the
exterior appearance of the edifice. It was dedicated
on June 15, 1923. Because it is not generally under-
stood, The Technic has secured an authoritative
statement as to the nature of this Library. It is
as follows: "This Library is designed for the use of
advanced students in American History who have
exhausted the facilities of a General Library." It
will serve the purpose of a Research Laboratory
for those who are qualified to use its valuable con-
tents to bring out the true facts of American His-
tory.
The New Engineering Shops and Laboratories
This building is essentially complete, and is being
rapidly equipped. Under direction of Prof. Badger,
the evaporators and their auxiliary apparatus are
being moved into the new building from their old
location in the old power house.
Due to slight tardiness in the installation of some
of the apparatus, the work in the Forge Shop was
delayed at the beginning of the semester. New
equipment in the form of electric and gas welding
apparatus and decidedly modern furnaces for heat-
treating, will do much to make Shop 2 a more val-
uable course to the real engineer.
The large machine shop with its new lathes, mill-
ing machine, gear generators and other new equip-
ment presents an interesting spectacle. This ad-


Page 29
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ditional equipment will provide facilities for a bet-
ter understanding of both production and tool-room
types of shop work.
The foundry shop will not be located in its new
quarters until after Xmas vacation, at which time
it is hoped that all will be made ready to complete
the semester's work there.
The Physics Building
Only last summer we peered over the edge of the
deep excavation which is now filled by the Physics
building, which will soon contain the best and most
scientifically equipped laboratories in this part of
the country. At present the plastering is being
finished and the Terrazzino floor is being laid. It
is planned to have it ready for next semester.
The Yost Field House
Our new field house so appropriately named by
the whole of the student body and Alumni, repre-
sents the most rapid progress of any building of its
size on the University building program. Work
was begun on this structure June, 1922, and
after only sixteen months, and in spite of the diffi-
culty in getting materials at times, every effort was
made to complete it for the dedication ceremonies
which took place November 10, the day of the
Marine football game. It seems only a short
period ago when the field house was first known to
be a real project, and now we are ready to enter-
tain other schools and colleges at large indoor track
meets, and also have ample room for a conference
indoor meet. Should weather conditions hamper
the early practice of the base ball team, the new
field house will provide facilities for indoor practice
far superior to Waterman gym which was formerly
used.
Uncompleted Buildings
In addition to the buildings completed this year,
there are several large projects in the state of de-
velopment. These include; the Power House annex,
the Heat Tunnels, the Hospital, the new Medic
building, the Literary building and the Law Club.
Next to the new Hospital, the Power House is
the largest job now under way. In order to keep
pace with the rapidly increasing number of Univer-
sity buildings to be heated and lighted, a new proj-
ect has been under construction since early in the
summer of 1923. This project consists of; the
Power House annex and the new Coal Storage
basin. The present battery of Wickes Vertical Tube
Boilers are being operated at 100% overload, and
with the increase of heat radiation surface due to
the new structures, which totals about 75,500
square feet, the need of additional boiler horse-
power is very evident. At present it is proposed
to install four-1000 H. P. horizontal boilers which
will operate at a pressure of 200 pounds. These will
be installed in the Power House annex which Is
being built onto the north end of the present build-
ing. Another departure from the type of equipment
used on the present installation is found in the pro-
posed method of handling the ash from the new
battery of boilers. Bucket type conveyors will be
used instead of the pneumatic system used at pres-
ent on the Wickes boilers.
For the benefit of those who have not had occa-
sion to know of the difficulties in storing in such
large quantities as is done at the Power House, a
word of explanation will make clear the purpose of
the new Coal Storage Basin. Finely divided particles
of coal oxidize rather slowly in air, and when the
heat thus generated is confined by a covering of
a huge mass of coal, temperatures great enough to
ignite the fuel quite often start the coal-pile to
burning. The difficulties encountered in fighting
this fire are not few, and it is thus that a great loss
of fuel occurs every year. The Coal Basin is the
attempted solution of this problem. It is a huge
concrete receptacle, 170' x 150' and 30' deep, in
which the coal is to be stored and can be kept under
water if necessary, thus avoiding the fire hazard
and loss.
The Tunnels
Closely connected to the production of active
B. T. U.'s is the problem of their distribution. The
Snyder Brothers, Contractors, constructed a Heat
Tunnel from Waterman gym along East Univer-
sity Avenue to South University where it turns
west and extends along the south side of the cam-
pus to a point west of President Burton's home.
A similar tunnel extends along the east side of
University Avenue to the New Engineering Labor-
atories. The latter houses an 8" main carrying boiler
pressure. The former houses a 14" main carrying
35 ft. pressure. All condensation from these heating
systems is returned back to the Power House
through the tunnels. The total length of the new
tunnel is about 1500 feet. The tunnel to the new
hospital is 1700 feet long, making a total of 3200
feet or about six tenths of a mile. The capacity of
these tunnels is great enough to meet the demands
of any expansions in the near future.
The Hospital
The work of finishing the new Hospital is gain-
ing momentum daily. The Building Committee
plans to have the completion of this structure well
under way by the opening of the building season
next spring.

This table brings out the fact that in the firebox
end of the flues the heat is taken up very much
more rapidly than in the smokebox end. In the
first foot of the flues the gases lose 330° F. and give
up 7.2 per cent of the heat in the coal fired, while in
the last three feet together they only lose 65° F.
and give up only 1.3 per cent of the heat in the
coal fired. On this basis the first foot of the Hues
is over 18 times as effective as the nineteenth foot.
Reviewing the foregoing, it w:ill be seen that the
efficiency of the locomotive boiler is largely due
to the radiation effect and to the effective heat
transmission of the flues. The fact that the com-
bustion space is almost completely surrounded by
the firebox heating surface causes 29.1 per cent of
the heat in the coal fired to be transmitted direct to
the firebox by radiation with no possibility of loss
so far as this portion of the heat is concerned. In
the transmission in the flues there is necessarily
some loss in the smokebox gases, but the small
flue diameter gives an opportunity for an efficient
absorption of the heat from the gases, so much so
in fact that the smokebox temperature is some forty
degrees lower than the temperature of the super-
heated steam and is 160 degrees above the temper-
ature of the water surrounding the flues.
FATIGUE OF METALS

important. Even here, however, our ordinary for-
mulas of mechanics of materials remain our best
guide for general design. The question of localized
stress is best taken care of by designing pieces so
that there will not be sharp notches and sharp
shoulders subjected to stress if it can possibly be
avoided. If such constructions cannot be avoided,
it is well to assume that the stress set up at such
a sharp corner will be at least double that given
by the ordinary formulas of mechanics of materials.
In a general way the strength of wrought-ferrous
metals under repeated stress is a function of the
ultimate tensile strength as given by ordinary test-
ing machine tests. In choosing a metal for machine
parts in addition to considering its strength, a study
of its microscopic structure should be made wher-
ever possible and metals should be chosen which
have a fine grained, homogeneous structure. In
this connection it should be noted that the initial
strains which are found in much heat treated mater-
ials, may be especially disastrous under repeated
stress. Such initial strains are sometimes shown
by the shape of the stress-strain diagram for the'
metal. This is illustrated in figure 2, in which are
given two stress-strain diagrams, (a) for a metal
relatively free of internal stress and (b) for a metal
with considerable initial stress. The effect of the
internal stress is shown by the gradual yield of the
specimen as fibers under internal stress successive-
ly reach their elastic limits.
In conclusion it should be noted that a study of
repeated stress and fatigue failure emphasizes the
importance of thinking about assumptions underly-
ing any formulas used and that there is added an-
other argument to the many already in existence
against the blind worship of handbooks and for-
mulas.
Julius II. Barnes, president of the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States, in a recent address,
cited ten production records that have been estab-
lished in industry the last few months. They are:
"The largest pig iron production;
The largest cotton consumption;
The largest steel ingot production;
The largest crude oil production;
The largest automobile and truck production;
The largest residential construction;
The largest production of locomotives;
The largest volume of mail-order sales;
The largest volume of retail sales;
The largest volume of railroad car loadings."
Mr. Barnes also made several significant com-
parisons of changes that have taken place in the
United States since the pre-war year of 1913. The
more important of these comparisons are:
"The population of the United States has in-
creased fourteen millions of people, with their en-
larged requirements.
"The annual national income has increased from
thirty-four billion, to fifty billion.
"The aggregate savings deposits have increased
from six billion to fourteen billion dollars.
"The deposits in national banks have increased
from six billion to seventeen billion dollars."

THE NEW MEDICAL BUILDING
This building, which is to occupy a site just op-
posite the present one on East University Avenue,
will be five stories high, have a floor space of 149,-
000 square feet. It will be V shaped, extending
330 feet along East University Avenue, and 240
feet along Washtenaw. These wings are 60 feet
wide on each street. It is proposed to finish this
structure by June 1925.
A NEW MOTOR FUEL
There is at present agitation in congress to re-
peal enough of the Volstead Act to allow our farm-
ers to manufacture alcohol at a profit, and thus
realize a profit on much excess foodstuffs, as pota-
toes, apples, grapes, etc., which now go to waste.
Just before the World War the Germans succeed-
ed in developing a new fuel in the form of commer-
cial alcohol, manufactured entirely from waste farm
products. Since the raw materials for this oper-
ation are a total loss if not used in this way, it
saves considerable money for the farmer who dis-
tills his own fuel, and makes money for the one who
can make enough fuel to have some for sale. This
industry was fostered by the German government,
and when the War broke out there were 70,000
such stills operating in that country. The idea has
since found favor in other countries, with the re-
sult that in England this gasoline substitute can
be bought for 25 cents a gallon, which is far below
the cost of gasoline; in Cuba the alcohol is sold
for as low as 9 cents per gallon. France, Holland,
and other continental countries are also using this
fuel in automobiles.

The Cooley Testimonial Dinner
Four Engineering Societies, Former Students and Friends, Unite in Tribute
to Dean M. E. Cooley
A MOST remarkable tribute to the personality
of a man was paid to Dean Mortimer Elwyn
Cooley at the Testimonial Dinner given him Fri-
day evening, November 23rd, at the Hotel Statler
in Detroit.
Over five hundred former students and later
friends gathered at the invitation of the engineers
of Detroit represented by the Detroit Engineering
Society, the Detroit Sections of the American So-
cieties of Civil and Mechanical Engineers and the
Detroit-Ann Arbor Section of the American In-
stitute of Electrical Engineers. Among the guests
were college presidents, deans of departments,
managers of railroads, bankers, attorneys, regents,
business men, presidents of national engineering
societies, friends dating from his earlier days in
Michigan, and friends made in the last two years.
Among the speakers was a former governor of
Michigan, a justice of the Supreme Court of New
York, and an Admiral of the United States Navy.
Friends came from New England, from west of
the Mississippi River and from south of Mason
and Dixon's line to pay tribute of admiration and
affection.
The gathering was presided over by Alex Dow,
President of the Detroit Edison Company and a
member of all four Societies giving the dinner.
After the Yellow and Blue was sung by the as-
sembly he introduced Acting Mayor John C. Lodge
who extended the welcome of the City to the
guests who had come to pay honor to one who had
rendered many important services to Detroit and
its citizens and presented the freedom of the
City to the guest of honor.
The Programme of Speeches
The chairman then introduced as Toastmaster,
Walter S. Russel, 73, President of the Russel
Wheel and Foundry Company of Detroit, and a
warm personal friend of Dean Cooley for over
forty years. The responses to the Toasts were ar-
ranged to cover the story of Dean Cooley's life and
began with "Mortimer Elwyn Cooley at his Boy-
hood Home," responded to by Robert F. Thomp-
son, *92L, of Canandaigua, N. Y., Judge of the Sev-
enth District, New York Supreme Court, who af-
ter explaining his selection to speak to a gather-
ing of engineers by recalling from his college days
the "close intimacy that existed between the en-
gineers and the bar," briefly reviewed the tradi-
tions and legends of Dean Cooley's early life, tes-
tifying to the determined character of the parents,
the wonderful inspiration received from Noah
Clarke, the founder of the Canandaigua Academy
and paid a well deserved tribute to Mrs. Cooley
as the "resident engineer" of the household.
"As Cadet and Ensign" was responded to by
Dr. Ira N. Hollis, Dean Gsoley's room-mate at
the Naval Academy, now President of the Worces-
ter Polytechnic Institute, who was graduated first
in his class with Cooley as number seven. He
told stories of the old Naval Academy days when,
as he said, Cooley sometimes got by with his
smile.
"As Professor of Mechanical Engineering" called
forth from Ernest B. Perry. '89E, manager of The
Industrial Works, Bay City, testimony to the last-
ing influence of the Dean's personality and teach-
ing upon his students.

Dean Cooley's War Service
"In the Service of his County" was responded
to by Admiral John K. Robison, U. S. N., Chief
Engineer of the Navy, as the official representa-
tive of Hon. Edwin Denby, '%L, Secretary of the
Navy, who began by saying that his grandfather
knew Dean Cooley and testified to the Dean's ac-
tive interest in the welfare of his former comrades
in the Navy and his services to his country in time
of need.
This was followed by a response to "On the
Yosemite" by Granger Whitney, formerly an en-
gineer of Detroit and a member of the Michigan
Naval Reserves, now engaged in farming and ap-
ple growing, who delivered an original poem de-
tailing the cruise of the Naval Reserve in the
Spanish War and the prominent part played there-
in by the guest of honor, under the title, "The
Dean a Sailor."
The Dean one time was a sailor bold and sailed in the
Carribee;
He'd shiver his main connecting rod when the wind was
in the lee.
He sailed as chief from the foot of Brush on a Grand
Trunk battleship
Wih a crew of dry land sailormen who'd ioined him on
the trip. * * * *
He stood on the deck of the Franklin, ship, in the Norfolk
navy yard,
He lived on goose eggs, scousc and tea and said that
life was hard.
The crew had gone across the bay where the liberty
men got tight,
But they sailed away at the break of day on the tin
clad Yosemite.
The force in the engine room got sore when found
they had no bread,
But the chief said, "War is Hell, my lads," and this he
also said,
"Remember the Maine and to hell with Spain and this
prehistoric craft,
"What 1 need is speed and plenty of feed and a pipe
and awning aft." * * * *
Our good old scow was wallowing 'round with her scup-
pers running red,
While the crew stood bravely to their task in a cruel rain
of lead.
The captain shook his hoary head, strong men were used
to faint,
For one of Morro Castle's shots had hit a
paint.
* * * *
keg of
Now the Dean's ashore and will cruise no more
In the trades of the Carribee.
His name and fame arc spreading wide.
They stretch from sea to sea.
He will anchor down in a harbor snug
In peace and deep content,
He will swing his 'ammick and take his rest
From a life so nobly spent.
And we who call him chief will come
And talk of our good old craft
Where he lives at his ease 'neath the shade of his trees
With his pipe and his awning aft.
President Burton's Response
President Burton responded to the toast "As
Dean of Engineering and Architecture" and ex-
pressed the hopelessness of condensing twenty
years of service into ten minutes of talk. In clos-
ing his remarks he said "You didn't come here
tonight because Dean Cooley is a scholar, or a
teacher, or a great engineer, but because he is a
human being, and you love him and he stands as
a living illustration of what America means—un-
sifted individual initiative. Such gatherings as
these show America at its best."
Dean E. Paul Anderson, of the Engineering De-
partment of the University of Kentucky responded

The Economic Value of Highway Transport Surveys
By ARTHUR H. BLANCHAHD
Professor of Highway Engineering and Highway Transport, University of Michigan
HIGHWAY transport surveys are erf economic
value in the development of a highway trans-
port business and in connection with the efficient
design and upkeep of highways. Only the latter
function of highway transport surveys will be con-
sidered.
Scope of Highway Transport Surveys. What is
a highway transport survey from the standpoint of
a highway department? A highway transport
survey embodies all investigations in the field and
office which are necessary to determine the prob-
able amount, character and effects of the future
traffic which will use a given highway during the
lives of its several component parts. Such a sur-
vey for a trunk highway must cover a considera-
tion of first, all highway factors which affect eco-
nomic highway transport; second, transport legisla-
tion relative to franchises and rates, weights, di-
mensions, speeds, taxes and licenses for passenger
cars, trucks, tractors and trailers, and state and
urban traffic regulations; third, traffic censuses of
motor and horse drawn vehicles; fourth, vehucular
operation as affecting roadways and other parts
of highways; fifth, present and future transport
business opportunities in the fields of agricultural
and dairy farming, mines, quarries, gravel and
sand pits, oil fields, lumber tracts, fisheries, plants,
factories, wholesale and retail stores and compet-
ing carriers, such as steam and electric railroads
and waterway transport; and sixth, the character-
istics of the methods of highway transport, such as
rural and urban motor-bus operation, municipal
haulage, long and short general rural haulage, in-
tercity haulage, intercity express, rural motor ex-
press and horse transport methods.
Transportation is one of the great sources of
national wealth. No railroad switchmen's strike or
long-shoremen's strike is required to enable the
business man of vision to evaluate the worth of
the continuous operation of an adequate transpor-
tation system. The economists of many decades
have taught us that the cost of assembling and
distributing commodities has a far reaching influ-
ence on their production and consumption. We,
of to-day, do not need to read history's pages to
appreciate the important part transportation has
played in the growth of the United States to one
of the great world powers. Even though we limit
our consideration of the advantages of an efficient
transportation system to its economic aspects, it
is apparent that we should make full use of the
three arteries of transportation: the waterway, the
railway, and the highway, and that each should be
rapidly developed to a high degree of perfection.
Experienced users of highway transport are in
agreement that the economic utilization of the sev-
eral branches of this method of transportation re-
quire the use of motor trucks of varying capacity
up to that of the seven and one-half ton truck. In
this connection, it is of interest to note that after
a committee of the Xational Highway Traffic As-
sociation had thoroughly presented the subject of
weights and dimensions of motor trucks to a Con-
vention of the American Road Builders' Associa-
tion, that Association adopted resolutions favoring
State legislation which would allow the utilization
of motor trucks with a gross load of 28,000 pounds,
a weight per linear inch of width of tire of 8(X)
pounds and an overall width of eight feet. Legis-
lation enacted covering the limitations noted will
permit the utilization of motor trucks varying in
capacity to those capable to carry seven and one-
half tons. Requirements of present-day highway
transportation pertaining to speed, vary depending
upon the weight and type of truck employed and
the kind of tire used. While the larger capacity
trucks, utilizing solid rubber tires, do not travel
over fifteen miles per hour, the lighter trucks
equipped with pneumatic tires, are capable of be-
ing operated at much greater speeds and, if these
vehicles are to perform their function economically,
many will operate at speeds of twenty to thirty
miles per hour.
Highways of the Future. Future highways
should be built for the needs of transportation. The
highways, outside of our municipalities, have had a
changeable status during the past thirty years, and
the reasons advanced for their improvement have
been many and varied, but mostly sound. Fortun-
ately, there has been rapidly developing throughout
the land a conviction that highways are merely
a means to an end. and that that end is the eco-
nomic and efficient transportation of passengers and
commodities. It has also become self-evident that
unimproved highways constitute a positive barrier
to the development of economic highway transport.
In order that highway transport should take its
proper place in our transportation system, the fol-

lowing fundamental guiding principle must be ac-
cepted generally: Highways should be designed,
constructed, and maintained so as to enable them to
carry efficiently the motor vehicles required for
the economic utilization of highway transport. Has
this sound, economic axiom, which should be the
guiding star of highway officials and engin-
eers, been sufficiently analyzed so that its full
meaning has been grasped? The transportation
survey will give us an estimate of the amount and
character of traffic for periods of five, ten, and fif-
teen or more years, dependent upon the location
of the highway under investigation. We now enter
the field of highway economics with a vengeance.
In considering how much we arc justified in
spending on an improvement, it is necessary that
we have knowledge of its life, not only from the
standpoint of its durability, but also from the view-
point of its satisfactory usefulness or serviceability.
Let us diagnose the highway and consider its sev-
eral primary elements from the standpoint of their
respective lives.
The locations of the highways, including widths,
curves, and grades, drainage systems, and bridges,
should have lives of from twenty-five to fifty
years, and in some cases, for longer periods. The
imagination, therefore, should be liberally drawn
upon in considering the traffic requirements of the
distant future. Next in our category will be con-
sidered width of roadways, foundations and road-
way wearing courses. These elements must be con-
sidered without the issue being clouded by illusions
or fallacies. We must get away from the salesman's
enthusiastic prediction that this or that type of
pavement laid to-day will last forever. In cases
where pavements are used under conditions for
which they arc suitable, conservative highway en-
gineers do not accord a life to the most durable of
our paving materials, the stone block, of more than
thirty to fifty years, while the other types, com-
monly considered satisfactory for trunk highways,
are judged to have lives of from ten to twenty
years. With an increase in the amount and weight
of traffic, it is also readily conceivable that founda-
tions will have to be strengthened and in many
cases rebuilt.
Drainage a Vital Factor. Hundreds of miles of
highways are unsatisfactory for highway transport
due to wholly inadequate drainage systems or total
lack of drainage. The increasing use of highways
by motor transport will cause so many failures of
insufficiently drained highways and others which
have weak foundations, that there will be a gen-
eral improvement in the near future. As loads are
transmitted from the wearing course to the foun-
dation and from there distributed to the subgrade.
the bearing power of the soil composing the sub-
grade is a vital factor in the design of the highway.
It is well-known that the bearing power of soils is
materially increased by efficient drainage. The
soil under the roadway should be so drained that
the maximum bearing power of the subgrade is de-
veloped. Let us have less talk of ruinous legisla-
tion against motor trucks which have broken
through weak roads and immediately start out to
provide the best drainage systems possible. If the
same attention is given to the drainage of the soil
base as is lavished on the visible parts of a high-
way, over eighty per cent of the annual spring fail-
ures of roadways would be eliminated.
In most cases, provision must be made for a
rapid increase in the volume and weight of traffic
units. For example, note the recent results of
traffic investigations in the State of Rhode Island.
On one trunk highway, the daily motor truck traf-
fic increased 1,113 per cent between August, 1913,
and August, 1920. the numerical daily increase be-
ing from 47 motor trucks in 1913 to 570 in 1920.
These increases are due solely to the development
of highway transport and not because the trunk
highways cited were unimproved in 1913 and 1915,
respectively. The width of the pavement, there-
fore, should be given careful consideration. Road-
ways economically designed must provide for carry-
ing the traffic on the paved roadway surface and
not rely upon earth shoulders to carry a part of
the traffic or serve as turnouts. It has been demon-
strated that the latter practice is neither econom-
ical from the standpoint of the maintenance of pave-
ments and shoulders nor is it efficient or safe from
the standpoint of the traffic using the highwav. In
other words, we must provide for a minimum of
two lines of commerical traffic. Considering the
factors of width and speeds of passenger cars and
motor trucks utilizing trunk highways and that the
laws of many states permit a maximum width of 8
feet for motor trucks, taken in conjunction with the
rapid increase in the volume of traffic on trunk
highways, the conclusion is reached that 20 feet
for the width of the pavement surface of a trunk
highway should be considered the minimum. If
the highway transport survey indicated that the
normal amount of traffic will require provision for
more than two lines of vehicles, a greater width
than 20 feet must be adopted, the additional width
depending upon the character of the traffic. It
does not require much imagination to reach the
conclusion that many interurban highwavs will
be subjected, during the next ten years, to traffic
which will necessitate roadways sufficiently wide
to accommodate at least four lines of vehicles,
which would mean a width of 38 to 48 feet.

A TRIP To THE NAVIGATOR ISLANDS
By ALFRED (I. PELICAN
WHO has not been thrilled by the tales of .travel-
ers and writers about the South Sea Islands?
Pierre Loti, R. L. Stevenson, Frederick O'Brien,
Somerset Maughan, Paul Gaugin, etc., are some of
the men who have given us a glance of the natives
of these islands in a very fascinating manner.
My own trip was taken partly to fill an intense
desire to get away from the very conventional and
somewhat materialistic routine of living which I
had drifted into (which was narrowing my view-
point in regard to life) and partly, to make a col-
lection of shells and primitive art for the Kent Sci-
entific Museum at Grand Rapids. A few weeks in
the Hawaiian Islands with its wonderful modern
hotels at Honolulu, and its exorbitant prices, gave
me mv last taste of civilization for some months to
come.
After seven days of ups and downs on the Pa-
cific we finally came to anchor at Pan go Pango, the
principal harbor of Tutuila. Here the boat stopped
just long enough to land my partner and myself,
and to unload the few things needed for the per-
sonnel of the navy department stationed at Pango
Pango. The bay of this harbor is nearly two miles
deep and except at the entrance is land locked.
In order to be allowed to land we had to make a
cash deposit of $100 and also satisfy the authori-
ties as to the purpose of our visit. This precau-
tion is taken to keep out beachcombers and other
undesirable elements who would have no difficulty
living off the natives. Hotels being an unknown
quantity we spent the first night in a room above a
store kept by a Scotch trader. The following morn-
ing we presented ourselves before Gov. Evans who
gave us some valuable advice as to the handling of
the natives, telling us to be kind but firm with them
and to avoid anv criticism of the government, as
the natives were easily led and also easily misled.
He then directed Judge Hall of Detroit, who is
Secretary of Native Affairs, to give us credentials to
all of the chiefs of American Samoa.
As I was anxious to make a study of some of the
customs and habits of the Samoan natives, I made
arrangements to live at the hut of Kate and his
family who lived in the village of Fangatonga.
About the only Samoan word which I knew at
this time consisted of "Talofa" the customary
greeting meaning "my love to you." Fortunately,
a young native named Tui who was able to speak
a little English, offered to accompany me wherever
1 wanted to go and to act as my guide. After giv-
ing Tui an advance payment of several cans of
salmon, some chewing gum, tobacco and gingham
for a lava lava (loin cloth), no tree was too high
for him to climb, no coconut too hard to crack. He
would pick out the nicest nuts by tapping them
with his fingers and then crack the nuts by pound-
ing them on his bare knees or eIbows.
From now on 1 decided to live fa-Samoa, that
is according to Samoan customs. Anything I did
according to the white man's customs was fa-
Palangi; Palangi is a derivative of the word Papa-
langi which means "out of the clouds," or "from
heaven" and was the name given to the first white
people who visited the islands.
It was somewhat of a shock at first, to realize
that there was no bed to sleep on, no warm water
to shave with, no coffee, tea. sugar, milk, bread,
butter, etc., and that to a great extent we were de-
pendent on primitive means for our welfare. A
glance at these healthy, robust brown bodies sit-

ting around us, naive and childish in their mirth,
soon reassured us that it could not be such a hard-
ship after all.
The novelty of the situation pleased me; the
friendliness of the natives, their inquisitive glances
and questions, their consideration of me almost
made be feel like a superior being. We were a
source of surprise to them. It is not often that
white visitors come to the smaller villages, conse-
quently our arrival was heralded about the village
and there was soon a steady flock of natives anx-
ious to see the two palangi. After feeling my lea-
ther leggins they would bombard us with ques-
tions in Samoan which had Mr. Heinz beat for va-
riety.
This kept up well into the night, until too tired
to keep awake any longer, vvc proceeded to undress
and put on pajamas. The idea of undressing and
then dressing again in order to lie down and sleep
was almost too much for them. We finally man-
aged to shoo some of the more inquisitive ones out
of the hut and lay down on a plaited mat placed
on the pebbled floor to snatch a few hours rest.
Early the next morning, with our towels draped
around us like lava lavas, we made our way to a
little creek where a number of the natives were
already taking their morning baths. Whenever
bathing with the natives, we made it a point to
take a place well up stream, for more than one
reason. After shaving and washing we returned
to the hut where we had breakfast consisting of
baked taro (the root of the taro plant wrapped in
leaves and baked on hot stones) and coconut milk.
The rather coarse, mealy taro always had a ten-
dency to irritate my throat so that I preferred the
banana poi as my staple food. This poi is made
by squeezing ripe bananas between the fingers
into a thick porridge like mass, adding coconut
and then drinking this.
cling to these customs tenaciously and although
some of them have been prohibited they are prac-
ticed in spite of the apparent complying with the
white man's law. Many of the bush villages, and


SAMOAN APARTMENTS
A great deal of etiquette is observed by the Sa-
moans in their intercourse with each other. Some
of these customs are very old and have been handed
down from generation to generation. The natives
SOUTH PACIFIC ISLANDS
villages on the Maima group are not easily acces-
sible so that absolute supervision is not only almost
impossible, but also quite undesirable. The Sa-
moan is best off in his national element; and at-
tempts to make him wear red flannel underwear or
"Walk-Over" shoes is as foolish as it sounds. I see
no need for clothing above the waist in that climate,
except it be to save the white man the embarrass-
ment of seeing a beautifully formed body in the
nude. There is a pride in the physical appearance
of the body which might to some extent be emu-
lated by the more intelligent and highly civilized
peoples of our own race.
Disease and sickness do exist, of course. It is
here that the white man can do a great deal to
alleviate suffering by educating the natives in the
elements of sanitation and hygiene. They have
no idea of the infectious nature of sores. I have
seen a cigarette taken from the mouth of a man
whose entire lower jaw was eaten away with sores,
passed among a group of boys and smoked. On
another occasion I saw a child on the island of
Tau whose eyesockets were practically covered with
flies. The child did not know enough to brush
the flies away, with the result that the eyes became
infected and more flies settled in the eyesockets
as the discharge increased. Another disease is
Filiaris or Elephantiasis, which is usually con-
tracted through the soles of the feet. If a leg
is infected it swells to the size of an elephant's.
It is not unusual to see a man with both legs so
enlarged as to be increased three times their normal
size. On several occasions I have seen different
natives scratch their sore covered legs and then
serenely go on handling the kiki (food). As a
rule, however, the natives have well developed, well
proportioned bodies of which they are justly proud.
It cannot be truthfully said that the natives are
immoral since their standard of morality is in no


Page 11

ways like our own. A better way to put it would
be to say that they are to some extent unmoral.
There is never any feeling of shame where the
human body is concerned unless it is in a deformity
of the body. A number of customs are so foreign to
our own conventions that they cannot even be
openly discussed.
To see girls catching devil fish by prodding into
crevices along the beach with a long stick and
then killing these small octupuses by biting them
to death seems strange. The sight of a girl biting
into one of these monsters with its tentacles wrap-
ped around her neck after all did not seem stranger
to me than the thought of biting into a live oyster.
It was always very difficult for me to sit with
my legs crossed, but in order to be polite I pulled
my knees close up to my chin and kept this posi-
tion as long as I could. At times my legs became
so cramped that I had to stretch them out in front
of me. In that case I could cover them up with
a mat. The natives used to laugh a good deal at
me for this and gave me the name of "vae faatu,"
which literally means legs straight up, but broadly
translated means "the man who can't sit with his
legs crossed."
At Fangasa, a little village opposite Massacre
Bay, we were received by the polinu who took us
to the chief's hut. A native missionary, an old
friend of Jack London's, read our letter to the chief.
We were then given fine mats to rest ourselves
after the long journey. The reception of a visitor,
if that visitor is welcome, is always celebrated with
the drinking of Kava. Kava is an infusion of the
root of the pepper plant (Piper methysticum), the
outer bark of which is scraped off and the root
then cut into small pieces. Young women chew
these into a pulp and spit this into a wooden bowl.
When all is chewed, water is added, the brewer
meanwhile stirring it into a muddy fluid. After it
is well mixed, a strainer is placed in it. This is
called a fan. The operator then presses the outer
edge of it down along the sloping bottom of the
bowl, and coaxes it upwards towards him with
his fingers so as to enclose all the solid matter of
the infusion in a sort of bag or parcel. This is
carefully wrung out and the woody portions re-
maining in it are shaken out. The operation of
straining is repeated three or four times, until the
liquor is sufficiently clear for serving. It is always
drunk as soon as it is made and is never allowed
to ferment. It is also made by pounding the root
between two stones. Kava in moderation causes
no bad effects; too much paralyzes the legs, the
drinker becomes emaciated, while the skin be-
comes scaly and can be scratched off with the fin-
ger nail.
Food was served on small plaited mats lined
with banana leaves. It consisted of taro, polisami,
bananas, coconut milk, and for our special benefit
a chicken had been prepared for us. The chicken
selected for us was chased around by native boys
who threw rocks at it until one of them hit it and
stunned it. The feathers were then plucked off
and the whole animal, head, feet and entrails in-
cluded, was boiled and served. As we had no
knives or forks, we picked out w^hat we could with
our fingers and left the rest for the natives.
On leaving we were presented with shell leis,
and two boys were detailed to escort us back.
With the aid of Judge Hall, we were given per-
mission to board the Government boat U. S. For-
tune, bound for the Manua Group to collect copra..
The U. S. Fortune is the oldest American boat
stationed in Samoan waters and is used for inter-
island service. The sailors call her the U. S. Sub-
marine Misfortune, because according to their ver-
sion, she is under the water more than she is above
it. They also claim that she is the only boat which
can pitch at an angle of forty-five degrees so that
the life boats touch the water, and vet not sink.

HOLEPROOF HOSIERY
There was only one cabin aboard ship, which was
used by the captain. The crew's sleeping quarters
were aft and since the dynamo was not working
on this trip there was no light. The small port-

holes, one on each side of the men's quarters.
were almost constantly under water, so that no
light or ventilation could be secured from them.
The heat was so unbearable that the sailors pre-
ferred to sleep up on deck in preference to their
stuffy, lightless quarters. We had awaited the
sailing of the Fortune for a week, but owing to
the high sea which was running outside of the
bay, she had postponed sailing from day to day,
until the captain finally decided to steam out and
take a chance. Although I was not sea sick, the
sailors' description of this submarine was quite
appropriate, and I saw several of them walk to the
rail hurriedly and talk to the fishes. With my
cork helmet for a pillow, I tried to sleep under one
of the life boats on the deck. I had to keep ahold
of the guy wires of the life boat, to keep myself
from sliding all over the deck. About three o'clock
in the morning, a tropical storm came up. Water,
water, everywhere and no place to come in out of
the rain. About the only dry place was the en-
gine room, but there it was so hot, that the men
worked in 15 minute shifts. One of the men com-
ing up from the engine room just saved himself
from being washed overboard by catching ahold
of the handrail. The casual remarks which he
made about that wave, Samoa, the navy, and things
in general, are not for publication.
About seven o'clock in the morning we sighted
Ofu. When within about two miles, the engines
were stopped and the whistle blown for the na-
tives to come out to take off some Samoan pas-
sengers who had been given permission by the
Governor to take some pigs to Ofu. The excite-
ment and shouting which takes place at these
transfers from boat to boat is quite ludicrous.
There is always a great deal of fun in it for those
who don't have to take the chance of being
drowned. I had my laugh when I could. I knew
my turn was coming at Tau. Sure enough. After
passing Olosenga and coming to anchor outside
of Tau, a big surf was running and we saw that
we were in for a good time. The sailors com-
menced doing their part by asking us where were
our bodies to be shipped, and what kind of flow-
ers we preferred. The captain told us in all ser-
iousness that in the event of our boat upsetting, to
swim out to sea and not attempt to swim through
the surf which was pounding on the coral reef. By
that time my hilarity had subsided considerably,
and when our native boat, maneuvered for a posi-
tion alongside the Fortune, and I was told to jump.
I tried to force a smile on my face, but it was an
awfully sickly smile. Luckily I landed in the mid-
dle of the boat, which was already half full of wa-
ter. What with the rain, mv soaking clothes, and
the rolling about in a cockle shell in an open sea,
I almost wished I were back in the U. S. A. Our
boat was so full, and so low in the water, that
every big wave would almost swamp us and set
the crew to bailing for dear life. After several
attempts to make a landing at Tau, we had to
abandon that project and row around the iron
bound coast, consisting of huge rocks and blow
holes, (which would spout water 50 to 100 feet in
the air) to a little village called Taliesau. Here
there was a little bay, and although there was
quite a heavy surf it was not nearly as bad as at
Tau. My heart was in my mouth most of the
time, and I had to swallow pretty hard to get my
adams apple back in its place.
On the island of Tau we were entertained at
the hut of chief Tufele. His taupo had made ar-
rangements for a big siva siva (dance) which
started about 9 p. m. (The tapau is the master of
ceremonies, especially chosen for the post, she
must be young, a chief's daughter, and of un-
blemished character. She is usually highly ac-
complished in Samoan fashion, can lead a chorus
with skill, make fanciful flower decorations and
hair dresses, and dance better than anyone in the
village. Her duties are to receive guests coming
to her village and see to their comfort by making
Kava for them and entertaining them with danc-
ing and singing.) The girls with their bodies
oiled with coconut oil and flowers interwoven in
their long black hair, made a grotesque but pleas-
ing picture in the dim light of the hut. The
dance commenced with a rather monotonous sway-
ing of the body to the accompaniment of low
chanting and the beating of wooden drums. The
rhythm increases from hour to hour until at about
2 a. m. the dancers throw aside all restraint (and
incidentally their siva siva skirts) and the dance
degenerates into a sensuous swirling mass of
beautifully formed bodies of a brown hue which
glisten as the light reflects in the oily film cover-
ing the skin. Considering that there are no mov-
ies or shows of any kind, we cannot justly con-
demn the favourite form of amusement and en-
tertainment of these primitives.
During the later trip in an open native boat
from Faliesan to Fituita our boat just missed
the channel and we were thrown in the surf. Luck-
ily two natives grabbed me so that I got off with
a ducking and a few scratches from the coral reef,
but lost about a hundred of my best pictures. Fituita
is a typical bush village. In order to reach it we
had to plow through decayed vegetation up to
our knees. What with the heat and the miasma I
was glad when we finally reached our destination.
Fituita is without doubt the dirtiest place I have
had the privilege of visiting. Overrun with
thousands of rats and black lizards it is far from
ideal. Even my native guides from Faliesau

The Cathedral Of Mexico City
By Guillebmo D. Herrera '24A
WHEN the Spanish discoverers and explorers of
America drove the prows of their frail ves-
sels through unknown seas in search of the India
of their dreams, they left Europe stirring with that
new life which was to blossom in the Renaissance.
The Dark Ages were just closing and the wealth of
knowledge and art so long hoarded in monasteries
and castles, barred from the flow of human life,
was about to burst forth like a flood to fertilize
City of Mexico; and in the same year the beauti-
ful cathedral of Granada, which enshrines the
tombs of the Catholic kings and commemorates the
deliverance of Spain from the Moors, was begun.
This is but a part of the list of architectural monu-
ments that might be compiled and which, in Spain
as elsewhere, were expressing the newborn ener-
gies and aspirations of Europe.
This passion for buildings crossed the ocean in

European civilization. Crumbling architecture
was being restored, churches and palaces were
being founded, great engineering works under-
taken. In many respects, indeed, the wonderful
activities and achievements of that time may be
compared with those of our own, in spite of the
differences in methods, materials and purpose.
When Columbus left Palos in 1492, St. Peter's at
Rome was in the hands of builders filled with new
ideas, but waiting for the genius of Bramante and
Michael Angelo; the cathedral of his native Genoa
was being greatly enlarged and embellished; that of
Seville was nearing completion; that of Toledo was
just finished. For three hundred years the Gothic
beauty of Burgos had been growing to its per-
fection in 1521, the vcar in which Cortez took the
the breasts of the Spanish discoverers and first
colonists, who, although they celebrated their ear-
liest religious services in tents by the seashore or
beneath the branches of unfamiliar foliage, were
impelled to erect as soon as possible temples big
and splendid enough to express the master mo-
tives of their age, religion, and art.
Cortez landed and burned his ships on the
beach near Veracruz in 1519; determined upon the
conquest of Mexico in the name of Spain and the
Catholic Church. He marked his subjugation of
every town and province by founding substantial
works of engineering and architecture, wonderful,
indeed, when one considers his slight acquaintance
with the materials, the labor, and the climate that
confronted him and the magnitude and beauty of

the results. His aqueducts, bridges and palaces,
roads, fortifications, etc., must go unmentioned,
as the purpose of this article is to bring into
prominence the Cathedral of Mexico. On entering
the City, Cortez destroyed the TEOCALI, or
Aztec temple, and erected on its site a small
chapel for the Indians, traces of which still remain.
This was later to be the seat of the first bishop
of Mexico, till 1573, when the corner stone was
laid for the most stupendous, the most impressive
and richest monument left by the Spaniards in
the New World, the Cathedral of Mexico.
Although the dedication of the great Cathedral
took place in 1667, the entire building was not fin-
ished until the early part of the nineteenth cen-
tury. It is natural, therefore, that the construc-
tion covering, as it did, little more than two cen-
turies, should possess something of the art of
these periods, from the early Gothic influence,
through the Baroque and florid Churrigueresque,
down to 'a return to the classic motives. These ir-
regularities, this mixture of styles resulted in a
small lack of unity in the impression made by
the big mass. It has often been mentioned, never-
theless, that the chief reason for this is due
mostly to the great distance found between the
towers. Charming and interesting as they are in
the mixture of massiveness and grace, many archi-
tects have suggested that this feeling of almost
complete separation from one another might have
been overcome by the addition of a new story.
As a whole, nevertheless, to repeat the words of
a well known and famous American, "the total ef-
fect of the Cathedral, is one of magnificence of
grandeur, of splendid mass and lordly superiority,
mastering its environment by right of design."
In it we find complete subordination of detail to
the larger mass, refinement and contrast between
the richly ornamental features to the plain sur-
faces of the great facade,—a characteristic not only
of the Spanish Renaissance but of the Whole
Spanish architecture as well, and the attainment
of balance and proportion by the use of uncon-
ventional and arbitrary means.
In spite of the many styles used, no one can
mistake the fact that the design in general is
purely Spanish. Freely and frankly confessing
itself in all its functions, perfectly organic in char-
acter, with the concentration of decoration in the
most salient points, the building carries the at-
tention of the beholder from the general to the
particular, impressing its merits through large ef-
fects of mass, form, outline and proportion.
Of particular interest in the execution of the
towers is the design of the third story which,
growing out of an octagonal base has bell-shaped
domes enclosed within a rectangular pavilion-like
structure, these being connected by a narrow-
band around the middle, thus serving a purpose
both constructional and decorative. On the dome
in the center, the use of glazed tiles as a surface
treatment, reproduces in the New World some-
thing of the glamour and fascination of the past
fairy like virtues of Moslem Spain.
We must not overlook the fact that when
Philip III sent over the last revised design for the
building "worthy of the grandeur of this kingdom
and of the Christian generosity of its Kings,"
Spain was to spend a sum of about $2,000,000, a
sum as colossal in those days as the dimensions of
the edifice itself. Yet, the interior of the church
fails to impress the beholder as to its size, the ef-
fect of space and distance being greatly hampered
by the position of the choir in the middle of the
nave, as at Seville and many other Spanish
churches. It is, besides, almost too severe, the pale,
grav color of the stone and great surfaces devoid of
decoration producing a feeling of desolation. This.
nevertheless, is somewhat offset by the graceful-
ness, refinement and beautiful proportions of
twenty fluted columns and a very elegant dome.
Still, in commenting upon the simplicity of deco-
ration, Sr. Revilla says: "These retables and the
predominance of vertical lines in construction—to
give the impress of a Christian character—prevent
the frigidity of effect that marks other temples
built in the Creco-Roman style and produces in
the soul a sentiment of religious reverence."
The scope of this article prevents the writer
from going into detail of the ornament and paint-
ings found in the Church as well as any complete
discussion of plan and sections, which are more
or less of the Basilica type. It is needless to say
that the erection of the Cathedral of Mexico
served as a stimulus for other great works of art
in the New World, like the cathedrals of Lima and
Bogota of which I shall speak at some future
time.
The Cathedral of Mexico is not only a jewel
of Spanish America but it stands as a monument
to the Spanish colonists, lovers of art, idealistic,
ambitious and courageous.
The J Hop
Following the usual custom of alternating the
leadership of the Hop between the Lits and En-
gineers, the latter will take charge of the grand
social event of the year which will take place on
February 8. Edliff "Butch" Slaughter, Varsitv
(iuard, whose consistent good work on the team
attracted much comment this season, has been
chosen general chairman of the Hop committee.
William Kerr and Charles Merriam are the En-

The Minidoka Reclamation Project of Southern Idaho
By Fred Goellner. '25E
AS you travel north and west from the valley
of the Great Salt Lake in Utah, you penetrate
a range of low juniper and pine-covered moun-
tains, tumbling in increasing confusion and rug-
gedness as far as the eye can see. Continuing
north for about one hundred miles over high
sage-covered plateaus and through fertile valleys,
you finally stand upon the last range, the slopes
of Mount Harrison in southern Idaho, and be-
systems to reclaim the desert country in some of
our western states. The money has the nature of
a revolving fund; that is, the Government builds
the water and power systems and, after a num-
ber of years, the settlers repay the money to the
fund. The costs are assessed against the acreage
in the form of construction, operation and main-
tenance charges and the settler is given twenty
years to pay for his land. Recently it has been

fore you is spread the valley of the Snake River
and the Minidoka Reclamation Project. Fifteen
years ago you would have seen a rolling sage-
brush desert extending hundreds of miles in every
direction, the monotony relieved only by the sil-
ver thread of the Snake River, winding on its way
to meet the Columbia. Today there is spread
before vou a maze of canals and laterals and the
checkered effect of fields and orchards under cul-
tivation, the results of the work of the United
States Reclamation Servce.
Through the provisions of the Reclamation Act
of 1902, the United States Government appropri-
ated all the money accruing from the sale of pub-
lic lands to a Reclamation Fund, to be
expended in the construction of water and power
necessary to make some extensions of time to the
settlers on account of the business depression
from which we are just emerging. The building
of the Minidoka Project was authorized by the
Secretary of the Interior shortly after the passage
of the Reclamation Act. Water was available
and the project opened to settlers in 1907.
The Minidoka Project contains about 100,000
acres of cultivated land. It is about twenty-five
miles long and eighteen miles wide and is sur-
rounded by mountains on all sides. The Saw-
tooth Mountains, to the northwest, are capped with
snow throughout the year. Idaho was originally
formed of lava rock thrown up from volcanoes,
now extinct, several cones of which are in the
vicinity of the project. Wind and water have

gradually carried in soil from Washington, Ore-
gon, and Wyoming, until now the Snake River
valley has some of the most productive soil in
the West. The climate is very healthful. Being
at an elevation of 42('0 feet above sea level, the air
is clear and dry and even though, in the summer
time, the mercury frequently climbs to 1100 F, the
nights are invariably cool and comfortable. As a

land of beautiful sunsets and wonderful coloring
of mountains and sky in the evening, southern
Idaho has few equals.
Water for irrigation is obtained from the Snake
River, supplemented by storage in two reservoirs.
Jackson Lake, at the base of the Teton Mountains
near the Yellowstone National Park, stores about
850.000 acre-feet of water and Lake W^alcott,
formed by the Diversion Dam at the head of the
Project, impounds on additional 95,000 acre-feet.
The Minidoka Project rights in these two reser-
voirs are of such an amount that, if spread evenly
over the surface of the project, the land would
everywhere be covered to an average depth of about
three feet. The water is diverted at Lake Walcott
into two canals, one of which supplies the land on
the north side of the river and the other supplies
the south side.
In connection with the south side canal there
are three pumping stations, the largest plants of
their kind in the world. The land on the south
side lies in three benches or levels, each about
thirty feet higher than the preceding one. To
handle the large volume of water required, about
12(K) acre-feet per day, there are installed 12 ver-
tical synchronous motor-driven centrifugal pumps,
varying in capacity from 100 second-feet discharge
coupled to a 300 horse-power motor, to 175 second-
feet capacity with 600 horsepower motors. Electri-
cal energy is supplied from the power house at the
dam.
As there are several projects near Twin Falls,
Idaho, which have a prior right to Snake River
water, a large stream is c o n t i n u a 1 1 y passed
through Minidoka Lam. Advantage is taken of
this flow to develop lO.OfX) electrical horse-power.
Five 1400 K.V.A. alternators transform the
energy of the falling water into three phase, 2200
volt current. This, after being raised to 33,000
volts, is transmitted to all parts of the project and
even to a small town on the other side of a moun-
tain, thirty miles away. During the irrigation
season, the three south side pumping stations re-
quire nearly the entire output of the plant, but dur-
ing the winter months, electricity is merely a by-
product. Rather than let the plant remain idle,
the government has established several very low
rates for energy to encourage its use on the proj-
ect so that now the plant is loaded to capacity
almost the whole year.
The use of electricity on the Minidoka Project
has attracted wide attention in the West and in
some eastern magazines during the past few years.
Hundreds of homes are taking advantage of this
opportunity to increase the comforts of life and
many are electrically equipped throughout. With a
a standard rate of about $1.00 to $1.25 per kilowatt-
month it is possible to heat a small home for from
$15 to $25 per month. Electricity for light, power,
and appliances is sold at higher rates and finds mul-
titudinous uses in the farm homes. Although in
some instances the Service retails power direct to
the consumer, the farmers are encouraged to form
mutual power companies which take electricity
from a central sub-station and distribute it over
their own lines to the consumer. Through the con-
struction of private lines in this way, electricity is
now accessible to about ninety per cent of the proj-
ect homes.
The availability of cheap power has brought in
many industries. There are at the present time

TWIN FALLS ON SNAKE RIVER
two large beet sugar factories, two alfalfa meal
mills, several flour mills and many other smaller
plants in connection with farm products. One of
the latest developments is the cheese industry,
which many a farmer has found to be an ideal
mortgage lifter. During the war attention was
turned to more bulky products such as hay and
potatoes. With the collapse of prices, however.

COLLEGE NOTES
The New Physics Laboratory
liy PROFESSOR DANIEL L. RICH
THE first unit of the new Physics Laboratory
is now aproaching completion, and will un-
doubtedly be ready for occupancy by the opening of
the second semester. The building is located on the
east side of the campus, on the site formerly oc-
cupied by the old Medical Building, which burned
primarily to facilitate the carrying on of work in
advanced laboratory courses and in research. For
some time yet the present old building will continue
to house the large elementary and general courses
in physics, so in the new building relatively little
space is given to class rooms and lecture rooms.

TYPICAL FLOOR PLAN OF NEW PHYSICS BUILDING
down several years ago. It is in the form of an
L, about 144 feet by 132 feet, with wings 60 feet
wide. There are four stories above the ground,
and a well lighted basement; under about three-
fourths of the basement is a sub-basement, and
under half of the sub-basement a second or sub-sub-
basement, making the building in part seven stories
high. The outside is brick and stone, harmonizing
with the other buildings in this part of the campus.
Inside, the construction arrangement is designed
In planning the building, the outside dimensions
were limited by the proximity of the Engineering
Building on the south and the present Medical
Building on the north. So, to get the necessary
floor-space five stories above ground were first con-
sidered; the decision, however, was to go one story
deeper into the ground. The nature of the gravelly
soil made this entirely feasible, the excavating being
easy, and the good building gravel thus secured
lessening the building costs. Since the water table


January, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is approximately 80 feet down here, the sub-base-
ments will be dry. Advantage has been taken, by
means of double walls in these underground rooms,
to secure constant temperature research rooms. The
depth, combined with the nature of the soil, will
keep out all surface noises and all ordinary vibra-
tions such as from trucks and street cars.
The Physics Laboratories of many other Uni-
versities, and several industrial research labora-
tories, were visited and studied, in an attempt to
embody in this laboratory as many of the praise-
worthy features as expedient, and at the same time
avoid mistakes that use has shown to exist in other
similar buildings. In addition to profiting by the
experience of others, the University of Michigan
has been particularly fortunate in its choice of
supervisor of plans. This supervisor, Professor
John F. Shepard, of the Department of Psychology,
understands the needs of laboratory facilities, and
has worked long hours to make this Physics build-
ing a little better than any other Physics building,
not only cooperating to the fullest extent with all
plans and suggestions emanating from our staff
of teachers, but also originating various improve-
ments that we otherwise would not have thought
of. The result is the first unit of a building that
all Michigan should be proud of.
The building is of the reinforced concrete skele-
ton type, the columns and floor slabs carrying the
entire weight and providing almost the entire
strength of the building. The floor slabs are light-
ened to a considerable extent by the use of hollow
tile between the concrete beams. This skeleton
type of construction permits most of the interior
walls and partitions to be of light hollow tile, re-
movable at will without weakening the building
in the least. One of the impossible things is to
look ahead ten years and provide for the arrange-
ment that will be required then. Other laboratories,
soon after completion, found changes often very
desirable and often almost impossible to make with-
out serious injury to the building or considerable
expense. In our laboratory, all partitions (except
corridor walls) have been kept almost entirely free
from permanent wiring or piping; so that rooms
may easily be made larger or smaller at will, just by
removing or inserting a wall. The trouble and
expense will be small, not even the floor needing
attention, because the finished floors were made
smooth and continuous before the cross partitions
were built.
The positions of the skeleton columns makes
the unit of construction 24 feet by 12 feet; nearly
all rooms are either this size or multiples of this
size. Thus a two-unit room is 24x24, a three-
unit room 24 x 36, etc. The largest room at present
is a five-unit room, 24 x 60.
Probably the most elaborate single item in the
building is the electrical wiring. In addition to
the 220 volt direct current and the 110 and 220
volt three phase alternating current power circuits
coming in from the outside, the laboratory will
contain three battery rooms, one of 480 volts 20
amperes capacity, one of 480 volts 10 amperes ca-
pacity, and a third of 320 volts 10 amperes capacity;
also a 200 amp 220 volt DC motor generator, and
smaller motor generators. In addition to ordinary
lighting and power circuits, each unit room in the
building is provided with circuits that will permit
any of this electric service to be used. This re-
quires over thirty distribution plugs and switch-
boards, ranging in size from six square feet to
eighty square feet each. On an average, about six
individual circuits for experimental purposes are
available in each unit room. The branching and
interconnection of this electrical system required
literally thousands of circuits. The" electricians on
the job made the remark that reinforcing steel
might have been dispensed with, the entire con-
crete skeleton being bound together with electrical
conduits.
Here again, in the electrical system it is imposs-
ible to predict future needs. The use of electricity
in all sorts of experimental work is increasing so
rapidly that no permanent wiring is likely to prove
sufficient in twenty years or ten years or even five
years. So to provide for future expansion, with
little expense and without disfiguring the building.
a series of vertical hollow chimnevs at every other
column, (i.e. every 24 feet), and a "series of horizon-
tal ducts on every floor, with connections to the
chimneys and metal doors out into each room,
have been built in. These horizontal and vertical
ducts are about 4" x 16": they provide paths for
the future stringing of a large number of wires.
easily and inconspicuously, from anv unit to any
other unit in the entire building. A newspaper
reporter, when told about the unusually elaborate
permanent wiring system now installed, and the
provisions for future expansion, came out with the
report, unfortunately copied by other newspapers,
that the building was being equipped to do research
work in concealed wiring.
Each unit room is supplied with gas and com-
pressed air; and both water and waste pipes are
available in nearly every unit, although not all
units have sinks installed at present. Scattered
plentifully thruout the ceilings are threaded inserts
imbedded in the concrete slabs; anything desired
in the way of apparatus or boards for supporting
apparatus can by these be bolted to the ceiling,
each insert being capable of supporting several
hundred pounds. Likewise several hundred small
threaded wall inserts, usually in sets of four, are


Page 19
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
imbedded in the concrete columns and in the outer
brick walls.
Thru most of the partition walls a series of small
holes have been left; these holes may either be
left plugged, or used to run small wiring, signal
systems, etc., between adjacent rooms. On all four
sides of practically every room, whether these walls
be of concrete, brick or tile, apparatus strips at
3&gt;&lt; feet and at 7 feet from the floor, have been
installed.
All the floors in the building have been deadened.
On top the rough floor slab was placed a layer of
composition roofing, on which was spread about
an inch of fine sand. Then, for added strength,
woven wire netting, then a thick top finishing
coat. All the ceilings and about three-fourths of the
walls are plastered, the unplastered walls being
either concrete walls in the sub-basements, or
smooth painted tile walls in certain apparatus rooms
and research rooms.
Now considering the floors one by one, let us
begin with the lowest or second sub-basement.
At the end of the corridor is a square room, 36
feet on a side, that is to be used for spectroscopy.
It is to house a large grating spectrograph. Ad-
jacent to this room are two rooms given over to
the making of gratings. In one will be installed
the new ruling engine now approaching completion
in the Physics shop. Three other research rooms,
one double, and two single, are also on this level.
The floor above, which is called the first sub-
basement, extends farther north and also farther
west. In this northern wing is the lower floor of
the two-story space designed for X-Ray work;
motor generator, transformers, and kenotrons will
occupy the center of the lower floor of this X-Ray
space. Above the kenotrons an open well per-
mits the high tension wires to be distributed on
each of the two floors, to ten special lead covered
windows, in two heavy concrete piers. The X-Ray
section occupies six units of the sub-basement.
In the western wing of the first sub-basement
is the lower story of a special two story sound-
proof building. This two-story building is erected
within the outside walls of the laboratory, but is
in every respect independent of the rest of the
building. It stands on its own foundation, a founda-
tion consisting of various layers of gravel, concrete,
roofing paper, cork slabs, roofing paper and con-
crete, so as to be as free from vibration as possible.
The lower story of this building contains a rever-
beration room about 20'x 19'x 13', smooth hard-
plastered, and is entered thru a steel door and com-
municates horizontally with a sound-proof adjacent
observation room by means of a passageway closed
with another steel door. A large vertical sheet
iron vane revolving in the room will keep interfer-
ence systems changing continually. In the corridor
adjacent is built in a concrete compressed air dry-
ing chamber. The upper story of the sound build-
ing will contain two heavily felted sound-proof
rooms. Removable concrete slabs in the floors of
these rooms enables either or both to be put into
communication with the reverberation room below.
The design of this sound building is such as to make
possible types of research requiring freedom from
vibration and as nearly absolute silence as can be
secured, in particular, experiments on the sound
transmission and absorption of building materials,
and on the measurement of noise intensities.
In the center of the first sub-basement, is a series
of research rooms, and a cold room. On the com-
pletion of the new Medical building across the
street, the brine from the refrigeration system there
will be brought across to coils in this room. Pipes
and ducts will connect the cold room with the X-
Ray rooms, and with the Radioactivity laboratory
on the second floor.
The basement proper contains in addition to the
upper part of the X-Ray room and the Sound sec-
tions, a large apparatus room, air compressor, elec-
trician's main distribution room with motor genera-
tors, the largest storage battery room, storage bat-
ter switch-board room, and 13 well lighted research
units. The first and second sub-basements are of
course, entirely artificially lighted, no outside win-
dows whatsoever, except the well down thru the
X-Ray section. The basement rooms are 13' 3"
high in the clear, made high enough to permit the
building tunnel system to be placed overhead in
the corridor and still leave ample head room. The
University's new main tunnel goes along just out-
side the Physics laboratory on the east, and so
opens directly into this building tunnel.
The south wing of the main floor contains a
lecture room, apparatus room, two class rooms, and
administrative rooms. The north wing has a series
of research rooms, a small shop and a receiving
room.
The second floor contains a library, a heat labora-
tory, a high temperature laboratory, two electrical
measurements laboratories, a radioactivity labora-
tory, a storage battery room and switch-board room
together, with apparatus rooms and offices.
The third floor houses two laboratories in optics,
two in sound, seven dark rooms, the third storage
battery room and switch-board room, a small shop
together with apparatus rooms, offices, and a few
research rooms.
The fourth floor has an alternating current labora-
tory, vacuum tube laboratory, a mechanic's labora-
tory, a glass working room, a chemistry room, a
set of four rooms devoted to high tension spectro-
scopy, offices, apparatus rooms, and five research

rooms. On the roof immediately over the vacuum
tube laboratory will be erected a 60 ft. tower, from
which antennae will be stretched. The other end
of the antennae will be supported by the East En-
gineering Building and by the Medical Building.
The building contains two stairways and an
elevator. The apparatus rooms on each floor are
grouped around the elevator.
Some criticism has been raised because the en-
trance to the building from East University avenue
is small and rather unimpressive; as one put it,
not imposing enough. It must be remembered
though, that when the building is completed this
will be the back door. The main entrance is to
be on the west side, the campus side. The present
rather bald west end of the L will be hidden en-
tirely, the L extended west, and north, to form a
U. The main entrance then, with the rear of the
old Economics Building removed, will be exactly
in line with the straight diagonal walk starting at
State street. This entrance will look more im-
posing from the outside, and the inside is to open
into an exhibition foyer that will silence any critic.
The second unit of the laboratory will house eight
elementary laboratories, several class rooms, small
lecture rooms and offices. Inside the U, two large
lecture rooms are planned, and immediately north
of the lecture rooms the new Physics shop, the
lecture rooms and shop being only one story high
with skylights.
Until this second unit is built, the present old
building will contain the enlarged Physics shop, the
liquid air plant, and all of the elementary work.
The removal of the research work will permit the
establishment of another much needed elementary
laboratory, intermediate laboratory, a few more
class rooms and some consultation rooms.
Conference of the Deans of Engineering Schools
The University of Michigan is again honored
and this time a good portion can be credited to
the Engineering School. The next Conference of
the Deans of Engineering Colleges will be held here
in Ann Arbor, during the hitter part of January.
Due to the wide interest that has lately been
aroused regarding the scope of studies and courses
which should be offered by Engineering Schools
definite action of much importance is expected of
this Conference.

Highway Transport Surveys
(Continued from page 8)
business is based on the results of an exhaustive
transport survey. Why should not the same policy
be followed when the economic investment of mil-
lions of dollars in highway improvements is at
stake?
In order that highway transport surveys should
be properly conducted and adequate economic pro-
vision be made for the development of the trans-
portation of passengers and commodities over high-
ways, each state highway department should estab-
lish a Highway Transport Division. This Division
should be under the control of men trained in high-
way transport engineering. Fundamentally, this
branch of engineering deals with the science, art.
economics and business of highway transport of

passengers and commodities, and includes such im-
portant fundamental subjects as highway transport
economics, methods, legislation and surveys.
It is believed that the preceding outline of the
investigations required to be made in connection
with highway transport surveys clearly indicates
that men having charge of this work require spe-
cialized training and education.
In the opinion of some, highway transport may
not be considered as a branch of engineering. On
sober thought, however, it will be seen that this
branch of knowledge comes well within the classic
definition of engineering embodied in the Royal
Charter of the Institution of Civil Engineers of
Great Britain, which, in part, is as follows: "The
art of directing the great sources of power in na-
ture for the use and convenience of man as the
means of production and of traffic in states both
for external and internal trade."
The Minidoka Project
(Continued from page 16)
it was found unprofitable to ship to any distance;
now more concentrated products are finding favor.
To one who has spent most of his life in the
East it might seem a hardship to live and work out
in this virgin country. The Minidoka Project is,
however, a new institution and is settled by a
great many comparatively eastern people. Thrifty
farmers from Missouri, Ohio. Nebraska and the
Dakotas, lured by the charm of the mountainous
country and the unheard-of productivity of
the soil, form the great majority of the 17.CXX) in-
habitants. With them they brought modern so-
cial customs and ideas so that, except for the gen-
eral air of heartiness and congeniality which per-
vades all of the Intermountain country, } ou could
easily imagine yourself in one of the newer mid-
western towns. There are now six towns on the
project of which Burley, with a population of
5000. and Rupert with 2500. are the largest. The
project has 22 public schools, 29 churches and 4
well established banks. The consolidated rural
school idea is well exemplified here, their admin
istration and records ranking them as equal to any
in the East. The fraternal orders are well repre-
sented. The growth of the towns is a good indi-
cation of the productivity of the project. On the
sites of these towns previous to 1904, when con-
struction was started, there was nothing but sage
brush, rattlesnakes, and jack-rabbits. Some of the
older settlers still there today can tell of the days
when they tended range cattle , n "the flats."
I have tried to give a very general description
of the Minidoka Project as an example of the work
of the Reclamation Service throughout the arid
West and Southwest. Within the fifteen years of
the life of the Minidoka Project, the settlers have
returned to the Reclamation Fund practically fifty
per cent of the original investment. This fact alone
is a good indication of the high morale of the peo-
pie.
The Minidoka Project is a territory rich in
history. The Oregon Trail, first traversed by
Lewis and Clarke, passes through it. Its mile-
stones are the bones of trappers, explorers and pio-
neers. Wrhile the romance of exploration is gone
from this land, the pioneering spirit still animates
its people. The dominating thought and impulse
is to build here a home, to establish here a well
ordered life and civilization with all its facilities
for making life easier and happier. The Minidoka
Project is today but one of the communities
to whom this vision is always present. There are
many more projects, some at the feet of the snow-
capped Rockies, others on the hot plains of the
Southwest, each a monument to the work of the
Reclamation Service.

showed their disapproval of the place. With all that,
I would have missed a great deal had I omitted
Fituita.
There had been a dearth of coconuts and ba-
nanas owing to the devastating work of a recent
hurricane, so that our food consisted of raw fish
and mase. Mase (native cheese) is made by dig-
ging a pit and lining this with banana leaves.
Bananas and breadfruit are then packed into this
pit in layers, covered with leaves and closed for
a couple of years or until needed through shortage
of food. After this rotten mass has decayed for a
year or two it is taken out and baked into cakes re-
sembling plug tobacco. The odor is terribly ofren-
sive; in fact limburger cheese of the most ancient
vintage is like Mary Garden Toilet water com-
pared to mase. Since it is considered very im-
polite to refuse anything to eat, it became expedi-
ent for me to always have a coconut served with
all food so that I could at least have something ap-
petizing.
Experiences followed each other in rapid suc-
cession, some pleasing and some not, but all in-
tensely interesting. The sunshine, romance and
adventure we so often read about in books on the
South Sea Islands are all there. The change of
climate, scenery, people, customs and so on all
serve as a stimulus to our desire for knowledge.
We must, however, be prepared to make sacrifices
and endure hardships in order to gain this knowl-
edge. A sense of humor, a few plugs of tobacco
and several sticks of chewing gum will often sur-
mount unforeseen difficulties.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

ARCHITECTURE

The Pageant of Art s and Crafts
THE pageant of the arts and crafts which was
given by the students of the College of Archi-
tecture of the University of Michigan on the even-
ing of December the 8th has attracted great notice
throughout the state, due to the very effective way
in which it was handled. Although much has been
said about the color effects, as well as the lighting,
there are many things which have never come be-
fore the public eye. So a little "back stage" discus-
sion of the pageant would not be amiss.
It was originally the idea of Henry S. Booth '24A,
to have this pageant and he had charge of it
throughout its entire period of construction. Mr.
Booth returned last June from a ten months' tour
abroad and he brought with him many ideas which
were incorporated in the pageant. The greater
number of the costumes used in the pageant came
from the Booth estate at Bloomfield Hills. The
costume department, which is held there in connec-
tion with an open air theatre, furnished them. Some
of the costumes came from Europe and others came
from Tunis.
It had been the idea of the committee originally
to have the large window at the end of the Assem-
bly Hall of the Michigan Union lighted by red fire
placed outside and so to silhouette the figures
against a red background. Later, however, when
the beauty of the costumes were seen, it was decided
to dispense with this and to use the lighting which
was finally used. Fifty large candles grouped
around an altar of pagan design furnished all the
light that was necessary for the occasion. The
candles were lighted by acolytes and this made
the whole matter seem like a religious ceremonial.
The whole pageant was carried off with a certain
solemn precision.
Among the properties used was a carved wooden
panel which is an original from the house of
Jacques Coeur. This panel still shows traces of
the original color on it.
There was also an enameled coat of arms cf
Exeter College, Oxford. This is one of seven coats
of arms which have been presented to the school
and which will be hung as soon as a fitting place
for them can be found.
The Chemistry laboratory furnished the glass
blowers' pipe and the new Law Club was respon-
sible for the sledge of the Iron Worker. So every-
thing was used that could be used and every de-
partment furnished its bit to the pageant.
The pageant and the dinner were attended by
more architects and people interested in architec-
ture than were ever brought together in the state
at any previous time. This speaks very well for
the efforts of the department and it is not at all un-
likely but that the pageant will be taken to De-
troit and there presented again.
Committee in Charge
Arthur K. Hyde, Chairman.
Henry S. Booth, Pageant.
Joseph E. Fronczak, Finance.
John E. Dinwiddie, Invitations.
Raymond Weber, Programs.
Robert F. Swanson, Publicity.
Douglas D. Loree, Banquet.
Ralph R. Calder, Alumnus.
Alexander L. Trout, Faculty Adviser.
Correction
A correction of the last issue states that Mr.
Alex. L. Trout of the Architectural faculty is an
Assistant Professor instead of an Instructor as
was stated. He was not in charge of the design of
various buildings which were mentioned but was
in charge of the structural design only.
Architectural Smoker
On the evening of November 6th, the architects
held their first Smoker. The committee in charge
of affairs composed of J. E. Fronczak; J. Leach,
and C. Schwenkmeyer had the good fortune to pro-
cure as speaker of the evening Mr. Kapp from the
office of Smith, Hinchman and Grylls, who gave a
very interesting as well as very instructive talk
in regard to the construction of the Yost Field
House. There were many difficulties to be over-
come in this problem, among which was a total re-
design of the steel work after the masonry walls
were partly up and finished. He also stated that
a great deal of the present effect of the building
is due to the curved bricks which are used on all
openings. The size of the joints was also a cause
of great worry to the designers and builders as
well as to Coach Yost.
The entertainment committee of the smoker had


Page 23
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
three boxing matches scheduled for the evening. In
the first one "Brute" Richer and "Kid" Maurer set-
tled their argument and in the second Jack Barry.
"The Connecticut Yankee" and "Hamtramck"
Oester entertained the boys. One broken nose and
a broken hand were the results of this match. The
last and best match was between Donald Boothby
and Victor Gondos Jr. Boothby showed the boys
some very clever boxing and it was thoroughly
enjoyed.
The Architectural Society
The Architectural Society, after having worked
for the past few years on no particular basis and
more or less of a mythical background, has finally
decided to incorporate. A new constitution has
been drafted and the papers will soon be ready
to be sworn to. The Constitution embodies some
new and novel ideas and the department will profit
greatly by it. Mr. J. E. Fronczak reports that he is
highly pleased with the work done by the Constitu-
tion committee of which Mr. Donald Boothby is
head.
The principal idea which will be embodied in
the Constitution is the formation of an honor soci-
ety in the school for rewarding those whose activi-
ties merit recognition. The school has long felt
the need of a society of this nature and no doubt
when this society has become established the al-
ready active department will take the Campus by
storm and give them something new to talk about.
Although no incentive is needed the Society will
bring still more people into activity.

The Change in Policy of the U. S. Reclamation
Service
Upon the resignation of A. B. Fall from the cab-
inet position of Secretary of the Interior in the
spring of 1923, President Harding appointed Hu-
bert Work, of Pueblo, Colorado, to the office. The
Department of the Interior has jurisdiction over
the Geological Survey, the National Board of Edu-
cation, the Bureau of Reclamation and several
other departments. Previous to this appointment
Secretary Work was Postmaster-General, this posi-
tion having been given him as a reward for services
during the 1920 Republican campaign.
Since Secretary Work came into office he has
announced several important changes in the pol-
icy of the Reclamation Service. The name of this
branch of the governmental activity has been
changed to Bureau of Reclamation to correspond to
the names of other departments such as Bureau of
Agriculture and Bureau of Immigration. The office
of Director of Reclamation was abolished and the
office of Commissioner of Reclamation was cre-
ated. Incidentally, this act removed from office
Arthur Powell Davis, internationally famous as an
irrigation engineer but not as a politician and made
room for I). YY. Davis, former Governor of Idaho,
as Commissioner. This juggling of offices has
caused considerable criticism in engineeering cir-
cles and a number of societies are investigating it.
Secretary Work hopes to place the Reclamation
Bureau on a business basis instead of having it
purely a question of engineering. This is a com-
mendable course of action inasmuch as several of
the projects are unprofitable and on the verge of
bankruptcy. How the rejuvenation of the Bureau
is to be accomplished by a man whose record in
business is, to say the least, not very inspiring, is
yet to be demonstrated. The forced "resignation"
of Arthur Powell Davis from the office of Director
of Reclamation hardly seems a just reward for half
a score of years of service in the Department and
would seem to indicate that the Department of the
Interior, in former years so free from political in-
fluences, is now being undermined by politics.
The Electrical Department is making an exten-
sive research in the subject of Single Phase Eleva-
tor Motors for the Detroit Edison Company. Pro-
fessor Bailey, with the assistance of Professors
Lovell and Fairman and Mr. Drcese are investi-
gating the whole subject of single phase motors
which includes (a) the testing of all commercial
types of these motors, (b) the investigation of the
patents on the motors to ascertain to what extent
patents are holding up their development, (c) a
determination of the economics involved in their
use. This research was started last year and is
expected to run over a period of three years.
During the summer of 1923 an experiment in


January, 1924
THE MICHIGAN T E C H N I
C
Day-lighting, the results of which are quite a val-
uable contribution to the science of illumination,
was performed by Professor Higbie and Mr. Young-
love of the Electrical Engineering department.
The results of the work were presented in the form
of a paper before the Seventeenth .Annual Conven-
tion of the Illuminating Engineering Society. Due
to the belief that there is a superfluity of daylight
available and that it may be had for nothing, very-
little research has been made in this subject,
with the result that many of our formulae and data
are empirical and even inaccurate.
The results of the research, briefly stated, are as
follows:
1. That the illumination upon a horizontal
working plane, lighted from vertical side windows
is usually far less uniform than is the artificial il-
lumination in a room lighted from overhead; that
the use of shades drawn from the top makes this
worse and is improved by using shades drawn up.
2. A coefficient of utilization under a vari-
ety of conditions has been discovered and, no doubt,
will be found useful in design.
3. That the usual criteria are substantially
reliable, namely, that the height to the top of
glass should not exceed half the room depth and
the glass area should be at least one-fifth of the
floor area.
4. The proper size of opaque strips between
panes and the effect of mullions on the uniformity
of light distribution were determined.
5. I )ata were obtained showing the effect
of repainting the room, color of floor and coverings,
of window exposure from two sides of the room
and the effects of glare from blackboard surfaces.
The results of experiments with Venetian blinds,
begun at the same time, are not yet available for
publication.
Radio at Michigan
Now that it is again winter, the interest of the
public in radio is revived from the annual summer
slump. Almost any newspaper of any note has its
broadcasting station for disseminating news and
market reports, while many schools, institutions
and stores have their plant for giving out items of
more special interest. The Eastman Conservatorv
of Music in Rochester, the Universities of Wiscon-
sin, Idaho and Washington and Union College in
Schenectady all give out scheduled concerts. Dur-
ing the Michigan-Iowa football game last fall the
I'aimer School of Chiropractic at Davenport broad-
cast the game, play by play and those who were
listening in realized fully what a potent influence
radio can exert in bringing the people at large in
closer contact with American University life.
Here at Michigan we are especially favored.
Each year there come to the University the best
singers and speakers in the world. On the campus
itself we have men of national prominence who
could extend their audiences from the narrow con-
fines of the lecture hall or Hill Auditorium literally
to millions of hearers. Lecture courses could be es-
tablished during the winter which would be of
special value and interest to professional people and
to the rural population. Obviously, alumni of the
University would be interested to know what is be-
ing done here; radio broadcasting would serve to
bring them in closer contact with us.
Two years ago the Signal Corps'of the R. O. T. C.
did considerable work and experimenting in broad-
casting the concerts from Hill Auditorium. A line
was laid in the heating tunnel, connecting a mi-
crophone in the Auditorium with the transmitter
in the Engineering Building. Considerable diffi-
culty was experienced in modulation due to the
fact that the ordinary microphone used will not ac-.
curately reproduce sounds of such varying fre-
quencies as are present in musical instruments and
in the human voice. The acoustic properties of
the hall also gave some trouble. In spite of this,
reports were received of good reception in Detroit
and Ypsilanti. It would seem that a continuation
of this work by classes in the Engineering College
would solve some of these problems and, at the
same time, he a practical application of engineer-
ing.
New Dial Telephones Require Intricate
Switching Apparatus
The almost unbelievable intricacies of workman-
ship necessary in the construction of the new auto-
matic telephone exchanges, in which the dial is
to be used in calling for a number, are shown in
some interesting statistics just announced by the
Western Electric Company.
To complete the apparatus required for the new
Pennsylvania exchange in \'ew York City, the
Chicago Works of the company was called upon to
produce no less than 21,000,000 individual pieces
of the most delicate kind of equipment, all of
which has to be inspected and tested several times
before being declared fit for their important tasks.
In some cases, the parts arc adjusted to operate
when the current varies by only a few thousandths
of an ampere in intensity. Roughly speaking, the
connecting up of this great multitude of little elec-
trical entities will require more than 4,500.000
soldering operations.
The amount of cable and copper wire produced
at the Western Electric works for the Pennsyl-
vania job is the greatest ever used in any single
telephone installation in the East. It is estimated


Page 25
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
that the copper wire used, including that in cables,
could reach from New York to San Francisco and
almost back again.
Prof. N. H. Williams
Those who took Physics IE and 2E last year
will remember Prof. Williams as a lecturer who
made things interesting, and who not only had an
insight to, but emphasized, the Engineer's view-
point of the subject. The few who dared to steal
away to dreamland in his lectures too well recall
his novel devices to bring them back to "the work
at hand." We heartily appreciate his sincere ef-
forts to present the subject in such a thorough and
interesting manner and are curious to know why
he is not here this year.
Prof. Williams has been granted a leave of ab-
sence for the purpose of doing Research work in
connection with a new type of amplifying tube for
use in radio communication. He is residing in
Schenectady, and conducting his work in the Gen-
eral Electric Research Laboratories. These labor-
atories are reputed to be among the best in the
world, and provide facilities in the way of equip-
ment, that make possible, study and experimenta-
tion on the most advanced theories in electricity.
We wish him success in his endeavors.
and offices into the old Engineering shops, which
have been remodeled in the interior.
Some interest has been shown by officers and
active members of the Unit, in the establishment
of an Ordnance Societv. The purpose of this or-
ganization would be to provide a gathering and
association of men who are interested in the work
and would like to gather further knowledge on
points of interest which arise in class, and also
to keep in touch with the latest developments in
the field. There should be enough interest in the
body to create an incentive that would make this
organization a reality.
Annual Junior Engineer's Banquet
On March 6, of last year, the Junior Engineers
held a formal banquet at the Union, the success
of which was far beyond doubt. It was hoped
that this would be the inauguration of a new tra-
dition here at Michigan and that it would be con-
tinued as an annual affair by the succeeding Jun-
ior classes. The perpetuation of this desirable
event rests in the hands of the present Junior
class. It would be the one time in his life that the
funior Engineer will be able to meet and mingle
with his classmates all dolled up in the height of
formality and dignity. Get the ball rolling early
in order that this may be made a memorable oc-
casion, class of '25!
R. 0. T. C. Xews
Far from concealed has been the fact that the
R. O. T. C. has been playing an itinerant role on
our side of the campus. They have been moved
about from place to place, and at present their
activities and classes are widespread. They have
a rifle range on the third floor of the Engineering
building, a quite orderly headquarters in the ....
building and house their equipment under
the stars. It is now proposed to move their classes
Ordnance Camp News
We have recently heard a lot about how easy
it is to learn if taught in such a way as to make
play of the study and work. Some of us didn't be-
lieve 'that, but we are now thoroughly convinced
that it is true. We spent last summer in Mary-
land, at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, having a most
enjoyable vacation, and learning much that is neces-
sary in the education of an officer of the Reserve
Corps. There we learned that one can have, such
a good time playing and studying that he doesn't
realize how much he has learned till it is all over
and he looks back on the six weeks' experience
with regret that it is finished.
While we were at Aberdeen, taking the summer
camp required for officers in the Ordnance depart-
ment of the R. O. T. C., we enjoyed many unique
experiences such as riding over stone walls in a
tank, firing a fourteen inch gun, and riding in an
aeroplane. We took all sorts of guns and motors
apart to see how they worked, and reassembled
them, and made tests.
We had all the fun that we could have had at
the cottage on the lake, where the family goes in
the summer, too. We played golf, and tennis, and
baseball; we swam in Chesapeake Bay; we had a
dance once a week. On rainy days we found the
fiction library entertaining. At night we could go
to town, and once or twice a week we saw a movie
at the camp.
One of the pleasant things about this vacation
is that it didn't cost anything. We received the full
pay of a private in the army, and the board of an
officer. Those of us who went down on the train
received our transportation and all our meals from
the Government, and those who preferred to drive
received the money equivalent of the meals and
transportation. We met many fine fellows from
other schools, and with them visited Washington
and Gettysburg and other nearby points during
week-ends, and had a great time all around. If
we were anything but seniors, and if we had not
been to such a camp, we should certainly embrace
the opportunity to go to Aberdeen.

Liquid Air Plant on Campus
At no one University can provisions be made for
Research in all the fields for which its professors
are specially fitted, but when several departments
find need for one and the same piece of high-grade
apparatus, the outlay is highly justifiable to any
University. Such has been the case of the Liquid
Air Plant at the lTniversity of Michigan. It is of
greatest importance to the Physics department,
but, since Engineering is essentially and ultimately
applied Physics, we are interested in the installa-
tion.
The Unit recently purchased, is now being in-
stalled in the basement of the old Physics building.
The process and the apparatus included in the
plant is as follows: To liquefy a gas it is necessary
to cool it below its critical temperature and apply
a pressure great enough to produce liquefier.
This plant uses a continuous and regenerative
process. The intake air to the compressor is partly
cleaned in a purifier and then compressed to 3,000
Ibs. per sq. inch. This air is passed in heavy pipes
through a low temperature bath and thence to the
oil and water separator, and into a final drier
containing calcium chloride. Being practically
pure it is then passed into a liquefier which makes
use of the fact that on expansion, gases cool. This
piece of apparatus consists of three concentric
tubes coiled in the form of a spiral, and all housed
in heat-insulated chamber. The high pressure air
is led to the inner of these three tubes at the lower
end of which it expands through a needle valve
to a pressure of 300 Ibs. per sq. inch, into the next
largest tube. In the second tube the gas flows
upward, consequently cooling the incoming com-
pressed gas before it reaches aforesaid expansion
valve. Part of the air in the second tube is ex-
panded through a valve into the third tube. As
this process continues the temperature of the com-
pressed gas is lowered more and more until it
reaches the critical temperature, when it liquefies
and is collected in a Dewar flask. As this prod-
uct in vaporizing expands 800 times, it cannot be
stored under pressure at ordinary temperatures;
so it is kept in open Dewar flasks.
Liquid 'Air finds a most interesting use in Phys-
ics research and practice. Much attention has
been given by the leading commercial concerns
to the development of the vacuum tube for radio
communication. Much use is made of the vacuum
tube in the study of light. It is in the production
of more perfect vacuums that liquid air finds its
use. To exhaust gas from within a tube a plunger
pump is used to reduce the pressure and then mer-
cury vapor, employing the same principle as is
used in an injector on a boiler, is used to exhaust
more of the gases in the tube. However, mercury
vapor will exhaust all gases but itself. Liquid

air surrounding a U-tube in the line to the vacuum
tube prevents any mercury vapor from diffusing
hack into the vacuum bulb by reducing its tem-
perature so as to solidify it.
Instead of getting the air from Detroit at $2.50
per quart and suffering enormous losses from evap-
oration, it can now be supplied at the rate of six
quarts per hour and at half the previous cost. The
approximate cost of the plant is $5,000 and it is
certain that it will be an asset to the departments
doing work which requires the properties of liquid
air.

After you've done your best
What then?
THE day is not far off when you
may be in charge of plant produc-
tion. Your first duty will be to take the
equipment you have and bring produc-
tion up to the highest possible level.
Let's suppose you've done that.
Machines are in good order. Work is
properly scheduled. Time studies
have been carefully made. Yet costs
are still too high.
Then the only solution will be to get
new machines which can do the work
faster at lower power and labor costs.
Such machines as the Brown &amp;
Sharpe No. 21 Automatic Milling
Machine have done wonders in speed-
ing up production and lowering costs.
Get acquainted with this machine
now. Write for this fully illustrated
book describing the machine
and several typical jobs on
which it has cut costs.

BRINGING MORE DAYLIGHT INTO INDUSTRIAL
BUILDINGS.
Dr. George M. Price, writing on "The Importance of
Light in Factories," in "The Modern Factory," states:
"Light is an essential working condition in all industrial
establishments, and is also of paramount influence in the
preservation of the health of the workers. There is no
condition within industrial establishments to which so
little attention is given as proper lighting and illumination.
Especially is this the case in many of the factories in the
United States. A prominent investigator, who had exten-
sive opportunities to make observations of industrial es-
tablishments in Europe as well as in America, states: "I
have seen so many mills and other works miserably
lighted, that bad light is the most conspicuous and general
defect of American factory premises."
"My own investigations for the New York State Fac-
tory Commission support this view. In these investigations
it was found that 36.7% of the laundries inspected, 49.2%
of the candy factories, 48.4% of the printing places, 50%
of the chemical establishments, were inadequately lighted.
There was hardly a trade investigated without finding a
large number of inadequately lighted establishments."
Inadequate and defective lighting of industrial build-
ings is not confined to the establishments in New York
State alone. The same conditions prevail in most sections
of the country.
Such conditions as mentioned above are entirely op-
posed to the laws of health, sanitation and efficiency.
Wherever poor lighting conditions prevail, there must be
a corresponding loss of efficiency and output both in qual-
ity and in quantity. American industry is not using nearly
enough daylight and sunlight in its buildings. Every
endeavor should be made to use as much as possible of
daylight for lighting purposes. To obtain this it is of
course necessary that the rays of daylight and sunlight
are permitted to enter the interior of the buildings as
freely as possible, with the important modification that
the direct rays of the sun must be properly diffused to
prevent glare and eyestrain. A glass especially made for
this purpose is known as Factrolite, and is recommended
for the windows of industrial plants. Windows should be
kept clean if the maximum amount of daylight is to pass
through the glass, but the effort will be well repaid by
the benefits secured.
In the presence of poor lighting, we cannot expect
men to work with the same enthusiasm as when a well
lighted working place has been provided. The physical
surroundings have a deep effect upon the sentiments of
the employes, and where bad working conditions are al-
lowed to prevail, there is invariably a lessening of morale
and satisfaction created thereby. Neglecting to utilize
what nature has so bounteously provided, daylight, and
which is so essential toward industrial efficiency, we have
an instance of wastefulness, but now that the importance
of good lighting is becoming recognized, undoubtedly more
attention will be given by progressive industrial employ-
ers to furnishing the means which are essential for their
workers to secure and maintain the efficiency, which counts
for so much in the success of any industrial concern in this
competitive age.
If you are interested in the distribution of Ugh I
through Factrolite, we will send you a copy of Laboratory
Report—" Factrolited."

TRANSPORTATION
THIS is a subject which is occupy-
ing the minds of many engineers,
and not a few students of this college
are preparing, themselves for an active
participation in one branch or another
of this extensive field. Of the more
familiar of these branches, volumes
have been written, but there are many
phases which have been neglected.
In this, the first issue of the Michigan
Technic to be devoted entirely to one
subject, we are presenting, several
articles which deal with some of the
less familiar aspects of the subject of
Transportation, in the hope that those
who read them will become more in-
terested and better informed on this
most vital of present day problems.

The Transportation System Of
The Great Lakes
Bv George A. Marr, Serrelarv and Treasurer. The Lake Carriers' Association
THE total railroad mileage of the United States
is upwards of 250,CXXJ miles or about 2y, miles
of track for each one thousand of the population of
the country. The revenue freight hauled over this
vast system of railroads during the year 1922 aggre-
gated 342,108.000.000 ton-miles. Very imposing fig-
ures, these, and to a comparatively few persons, even
to those who are intimate with the traffic of the
(jreat Lakes, is it a familiar fact that the ton-mile-
age of the freight carried in the few hundred ves-
sels which compose the commercial fleet of these
inland waters exceeds a quarter of the ton-mileage
of this great network of railroads, and this at a rate
of freight about one-tenth of the average per mile
freight rate of the railroads of the country and not
more than a quarter of the average mile rate on the
most favored single railroad. This commerce has
attained these proportions within the memory of
man} men now living.
An eighteen-foot drop in the St. Mary's River,
connecting Lakes Superior and Huron, presented an
obstruction to the trade between Lake Superior and
the lower lakes which was passable only by portag-
ing around the falls. This barrier was broken in
1855 by the construction of the first lock at Sault
St. Marie by the State of Michigan, and this event,
not yet seventy years ago, marks the beginning of
the evolution of the Lake commerce. Such was the
primitiveness of the Northwest at this period that
when the question of a grant of land to the State
of Michigan for the construction of this lock and
its canal was under consideration in the halls of
Congress, so astute a statesman as Henry Clay de-
clared in derision of its utility that we might as well
attempt to project commerce and civilization to the
moon as up to that wilderness. The land was ap-
propriated, however, and the canal built. It included
two tandem locks, each 370 feet long, 70 feet in
width, the lift of each being 9 feet, and their depths
\iy2 feet.
Iron ore deposits had been discovered in the Lake
Superior region as early as 1844 but the commercial
development of the mines was practically coinci-
dent with the opening of the Michigan State Lock
and the shipments of ore that year, 1855, amounted
to 1,449 tons, and the total traffic of all commodi-
ties through the new locks amounted during the
season of navigation to 14,503 tons.
Practically all of the lake bulk freight was at this
time carried in sail vessels of which the largest was
of some 1800 tons capacity. Towed by tugs, singh
or in fleets up to four or five or more, through the
rivers between Lakes Superior and Huron or Lakes
Huron and Erie, they made the rest of the trip un-
der sail alone.
In 1869 the first steam barge, the R. J. Hackett,
the prototype of the modern freight steamer, was
built and this marked the transition from sail to
steam motive power on the Great Lakes. She was
211 feet long, 32 feet beam, 20 feet 5 inches depth,
and on the draft of water then available carried
about 1,000 tons. The modern freighters, have come
to a size of 617 feet in length, 64 feet beam, 32 feet
depth, and carry 15,000 tons, practically a full sea-
son's task for the Hackett at the time she came out,
in which season the Lake Superior traffic was 368,-
000 tons.
Twenty years ago the largest bulk freight vessel


March, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
was the steamer James J. Hill of a gross registered
tonnage of 6,025 tons and a carrying capacity of
8,300 tons. There are now 153 steamers larger than
the Hill with deadweight capacities ranging up to
15,000 tons.
With the increasing dimensions of the bulk
freight type of vessel there has come a standardiza-
tion adapted to the rapidly growing trade and de-
signed to facilitate the processes of loading and im-
is weighed and another conveyor receives it and
deposits it on the wharf. This type of ship can un-
load her cargo at docks where no machinery is in-
stalled for that purpose.
Loading and unloading facilities have kept pace
with the growing demands of this highly specialized
commerce and where, in the days of the steamer
Hackett, the unloading of her 1,000 ton cargo re-
quired from three days to a week, a 12.000 ton ore

loading. The present type of ship is so constructed
that with hatches extending athwartships nearly the
full breadth of the ship and the openings of nine feet
fore-and-aft, spaced twelve feet centers; or twelve
feet fore-and-aft, spaced twenty-four feet centers,
the deck in preparation for receiving or discharging
cargo is thrown almost completely open.
A new type of vessel for the carrying of lime-
stone, which is used as a Mux in the smelting of iron
ore, has been brought out in recent years. This
vessel is in general construction similar to the or-
dinary bulk freighter just described. The hold, how-
ever, is of hopper form, the sides slanting to a
longitudinal trough. On the deck there is a large
structural steel boom which at rest extends fore-
and-aft amidships, but when loading is swung out-
board over the dock. Tn the trough at the bottom
of the hold there is a conveyor which carries the
stone, fed to it by gravity, up to the boom where it
cargo is now removed from a ship, weighed and
put in the storage pile or loaded into railroad cars
for transportation to the furnaces in a few hours—
often between breakfast and lunch or between dark-
ness and daylight. The original method of unload-
ing ore, sand, coal or such bulky commodity by
buckets swung from the rigging, hoisted aloft by
horses, dumped into wheelbarrows and wheeled
ashore, has given away to elaborate and highly ef-
ficient machinery.
In 1880 a single cable-wired rig was invented bv
Alexander E. Brown which served the purpose of
hoisting the bucket from the hold and conveying it
to storage. This innovation, which revolutionized
unloading methods, was installed on a dock at
Cleveland in 1882, the plant consisting of five rigs
with the machinery all in one house. Some years
clasped before the next step in the progress of un-
loading machinery, the self-filling bucket, or clam-


Page 7

shell, became a part of the unloading equipment.
This was the invention of Mr. Mason of the firm of
Hoover &amp; Mason, of Chicago, and was applied to a
hoisting tower. The general features of this buck-
et were its great weight which enabled it to handle
any grade of ore, its tremendous spread when open
and the peculiar movement of the blades when
closing. It had a capacity of five tons of ore and a
spread of eighteen feet.
In 1899 George H. Hulett designed a type of ma-
chine differing greatly from either of the foregoing,
and this has established the unloading record. A
massive gantry traveling on rails parallel to the
wharf supports a carriage which has a traverse at
right angle to the face of the dock. This carriage
in turn supports a tilting girder at the water end of
which hangs a vertical leg carrying a rotatable
clamshell bucket.
Ore loading is accomplished by gravity. The
loading docks consist of a series of pockets on the
top of which dump cars bringing the ore from the
mines are run. Their loads are dumped into these
pockets each of which is provided with a chute
which, in the operation of loading, is projected into
the hold of the vessel and is so adjustable that it
can direct the ore as desired for proper loading.
These pockets and chutes are spaced in conformity
with the hatch openings of the vessels so that any
number of them may be dropped into the ship and
operated at one time.
With this process of loading, the steamer 1). G.
Kerr, on Sept. 7, 1921, as a special test, loaded
12,508 gross tons of iron ore at Two Harbors, Minn-
esota, in \h}A minutes. This same cargo was un-
loaded at Conneaut, Ohio, on Sept. 12 in three
hours and five minutes. While the average loading
and unloading rate is not nearly so fast, it is a com-
mon occurrence for a vessel to receive her cargo in
an hour or two and discharge it in six or seven
hours.
Nor is the development confined to ore loading
equipment. The existing method of loading soft
coal is to run the loaded car, usually of the 50-ton
type, upon a platform where it is automatically
clamped. It is then elevated to a height well above
the deck of the vessel and inverted, its load being
projected into a chute which deposits the coal in
the cargo hold, with a minimum of breakage. Hard
coal is loaded in the same manner as iron ore.
The steamer I). G. Kerr, at Conneaut, Ohio, on
July 30, 1921, thus received a cargo of 13,876^ net
tons of soft coal and 369 tons of bunker coal in four
hours and thirty minutes.
In the manner of grain handling the process is for
the elevator to project one or more spouts into the
cargo hold of the vessel. The grain is elevated from
the bins in the elevator and runs by gravity through
the spouts into the ship, the spouts so directing
and distributing the grain as to load the vessel
evenly.
The unloading method is, with slight variation,
the reverse of that of loading. The leg of the ele-
vator, in which there is an endless belt with metal
buckets at short intervals, is placed in the hold of
the boat. So long as this leg stands in deep grain
the latter feeds the buckets and is carried up into
the elevator where it is placed in bins or directed
into railroad cars. When the cargo has become
so depleted that the grain does not automatically
feed the elevator leg, steam shovels attached to long

THE SAULT CANAL IN 1875
cables are put into the ship and the grain scraped
to the elevator leg by power provided by the
elevator.
At Fort Williams and Port Arthur, adjoining
ports, there is elevator capacity for 63,(,90,0(X) bush-
els of grain at one time in 20 elevators. Duluth
has storage capacity for 37.400,&lt;XX) bushels: Chi-
cago, 31,875.OCX), and other shipping ports 7,500,000.
Elevators at the receiving port of Buffalo can store
26,130,000 bushels, while those at other ports where
the ships unload can hold 24,525,(XX), thus providing
an aggregate holding space for 191,180,000 bushels.
The navigation period on the Great Lakes is re-
stricted to a season of 225 to 240 days, extending
generally from the middle of April to the middle of
December. During the winter months the connect-

ing channels are ice bound and aside from a few
car ferries and passenger boats that operate in the
open lakes, the trade is suspended and the vessels
are laid up. During the eight months period of
navigation all of the business of the lakes has to be
performed.
In the earlier years of the trade the traffic was
measured only by the records of the Sault Ste. Marie
locks where the Governments of United States and
Canada have kept complete statistics of the corn-
greatest tonnage passed through that channel in a
single season. In the month of July, 1923, this
commerce amounted to 14,388,908 tons and in Aug-
ust 14,353,044. a movement of 28,742,052 tons in 62
days. In this connection it may be noted that while
both the Panama and Suez canals broke their rec-
ords, the twelve months total of the former was
21,916,015 net tons and of the latter 23,545,128 tons.
The traffic of the entire chain of lakes for the
season of 1923 in the principal commodities clearly

merce passing through the canals. Hence until
quite recently only the trade between Lake Superior
and the lower lakes has been definitely recorded. In
later years, however, means have been devised of
gauging the traffic in the principal commodities of
iron ore, coal, grain and stone. Beginning with the
opening of the State Lock at the Sault in 1855, when
the Lake Superior commerce was less than 15,000
tons, it annually increased almost by arithmetical
progression and in twenty years passed the million
ton mark. In 1895, forty years after traffic began,
it had reached beyond the 15 million ton volume.
In 1902 it was nearly 36 million tons. In 1906 it ex-
ceeded 51 millions. In 1913 it closely approached
80 millions and in 1916 measured its maximum of
91.888,219 tons.
In the season last past the traffic of the Sault
Canals amounted to 91,379, 658 tons and shows post
war recovery of the lake trade to a favorable com-
parison with that of the war year 1916, when the
demonstrates the coodination and adaptability of
the lake fleet and the improvement of channels,
harbors, and port facilities for the handling of this
very highly specialized trade, a large factor in the
agricultural and industrial progress of the nation.
This consisted of 59,036,704 gross tons of iron ore.
or 66,121,108 net tons of 2,000 pounds; 410,753,156
bushels of grain, or 11,850,446 net tons; 33.137,028
tons of coal; 9,920,422 tons of stone—a grand total
of 121,029,004 net tons—all handled in a season of
240 days.
In respect of passenger traffic there has also been
great advancement made. The Mayflower, built in
1849, 284 feet in length, 35 feet beam and 12 feet
deep, was the largest vessel of her day and her ap-
pointments were then considered the last word in
steamboat construction and fitout. There were 85
staterooms with accommodations for 300 cabin pas-
sengers and provision in the steerage for 350 im-
migrants.


Page 9
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
By easj stages progress has been made, cul-
minating in the construction of two passenger
steamers that are 550 feet in length, 58 feet
molded breadth, with beam of 100 feet over the
guards, and a molded depth of 23} j feet. These
vessels, which are of the side-wheel type, will have
205 rooms, including twelve parlors, on the prom-
enade deck; 254 rooms, including twelve parlors, on
the gallery deck; and on the upper deck 166 double
berth rooms, making a total of 650 rooms and ac-
commodating 1200 passengers with berths and beds.
In the early days of this trade, the depth of water
in some of the connecting channels restricted the
draft of vessels to 10 feet. Improvement of chan-
nels by the Government has been interrupted by
the Civil War and by 1866 the Government had ex-
pended only three million dollars on all lake im-
provements. Senator Palmer, of Michigan, said
many years ago:
"There is not a man gathering ice in Maine,
a miner in Pennsylvania, a farmer in the North
or the Southwest or the Middle West, nor a
consumer anywhere who is not definitely ben-
efited by this lake commerce, this cheap trans-
portation."
Ceneral O. M. Poe, a distinguished officer of the
Corps of Engineers of the U. S. Army, long sta-
tioned at Detroit in charge of the greatest of the
lake improvements, before he died thirty years ago,
said:
"Surely such a commerce deserves every aid
and encouragement that can be extended to
them, (liven a channel of twenty feet draft and
it needs no prophet to predict a still more won-
derful growth. Nearly 35 years I have watched
it, but neither I nor anyone else within my
knowledge has been able to expand at the same
rate. The wildest expectations of one year seem
absurdly tame the next."
The benefits of this great waterway are self-evi-
dent, and so the Government, fully appreciating this
asset, has spent money liberally and judiciously in
the deepening of its harbors and channels and in
the construction of new channels; in the building
of locks and canals at the Sault and in the provid-
ing of lighthouses and fog signals and the marking
of shoals and reefs.
A short time after General Poe's death the
twenty foot channel was completed and the traffic
increased from 15 million tons in the year in which
he spoke as above to 92 million twenty years later.
I'p to 1912 the United States Government had
expended approximately $150,000,000 in improve-
ments on the Great Lakes and Alfred Noble, one
of the most noted hydraulic engineers in the world,
-aid at that time that from vear to v ear the annual
saving in cost of carriage, over any other method,
nets more in returns to the people of this country
than the amount of all the Government expenditures
from the beginning of the first improvements on
the lakes.
The State Lock at the Sault was replaced in 1881
by the Weitzel Lock, 515 feet long, 80 feet wide
and 17 feet deep. Then followed in 1896 the Poe
Lock, 800 feet long. 100 feet wide and 22 feet deep,
which it was expected would accommodate any
four vessels in a single lockage. By the time of its
completion there were a number of boats so large
that two of them could not be locked through to-
gether. The third lock, 1350 feet long, 80 feet wide
and 24:2 feet deep, was completed in 1914 and be-
fore its completion work on a fourth lock similar
dimensions was well under way. This one was
finished and opened to navigation in 1919.
In the meantime the Canadian Government con-
structed a lock on their side of the boundary line.
(KX) feet long. 60 feet wide and 22 feet deep, which
was finished in 1895.
The American locks are filled or emptied in about
9 minutes and the gates open in \}2 minutes. An

up-lockage of a single boat has been made through
the Poe Lock in 11 minutes, through the Third
Lock in 13 minutes, and through the Fourth Look
in 11 minutes; but the average time spent in mak-
ing a lockage in the season of 1922 was 33 minutes
26 seconds, this difference being due to the slow
movement of the boats while entering and leaving
the locks and to the fact that in nearly half of the
lockages more than one boat was passed. Frequent-
ly as many as five boats were included in a single
lockage.
The Canadian Lock can be operated in about 10
minutes. The average time of lockages in 1922 was
16 minutes 3 seconds.
The Livingstone Channel, built in the lower
reaches of Detroit River, was finished in 1912. This
channel is for about 6 miles of its 12-mile length

Why Not Cooperation In Transportation?
By Herbert C. Sadler, D. Sc.
Professor of Naval Architecture
THE history of the development of transporta-
tion in the United States differs somewhat from
that of the older countries of the world. In Europe
the successive steps were marked, first, by the use
of waterways, then the highway and finally the
railroad; whereas in this country the order has been,
the waterway, the railroad and finally the highway.
There is no doubt that the railroad has been the
dominating factor in the development of the United
States, largelv because it made sections of the
country available for colonization in the early days.
It is somewhat natural, therefore, that our indus-
trial system should have been developed around
the railroad as a fundamental unit, and little atten-
tion given to the other possibilities.
In the early days, also, there was another very
practical reason why some of our early waterways
and canals gradually disappeared as a sensible fac-
tor in transportation. The railroads saw in these,
or thought they saw, a powerful competition and
started a war of "extermination" and when this
competition was down and out, the usual results
followed, viz. an increase in freight rates.
Tt is not the object of this short communication
to discuss one method of transportation as against
another, nor to praise, blame or excuse any policy
adopted in the past; but rather to point out where
mistakes have been made and to suggest where, in
the light of our modern conditions, progress can be
made in the future.
One very common argument made against water-
ways is that every ton of freight shipped by water
means a ton lost to the railroad. On the surface
this seems reasonable, but do the facts substantiate
the statement? An examination of the statistics of
other countries will show that as the volume of
trade on canals or waterways has increased, there
is also a corresponding increase in railroad traffic.
The reason is obvious. When manufacturers can
obtain their raw. bulky and heavy materials at a
minimum cost so far as transportation is concerned,
they are in a favorable position and increase of
business results. This increase is immediately re-
flected in other forms of transportation especially
the railroads, which act as the general distributor
of the finished product, which they can handle at a
much better profit. In fact the prosperity of any
manufacturing center is bound to be followed by
prosperity in railroads and other means of transpor-
tations; but as the cost of this item is a pyramiding
cost from raw material to finished product, anything
that can be done to decrease at least one of these
charges will, in general, lead to better business con-
ditions. It is also a well known fact that it does
not pay to transport heavy and bulky products at a
high rate of speed, and it is doubtful if many rail-
roads make much actual profit on the movement of
such commodities. Waterways can and do move
materials of this nature economically and with
profit. This is beautifully illustrated in the case of
the vessels of the Great Lakes where the cost per
ton mile is the cheapest in the world and about
one-fifth of the cost of moving the same product*
by rail. This brings up another'factor which plays
an important part in the general economy of water
transportation, viz. terminal facilities. On the Great
Lakes these have been developed to a high degree
of efficiency; but in many of our waterway systems
such facilities are still lacking. In Germany, for in-
stance, most of the towns along a waterway have
good docks, adequately equipped for hauling the
various materials shipped. It is therefore necessarv
that sonic attention be paid to this factor in the
future if full benefit is to be obtained from our
waterways; but as will he shown later this tack has
been somewhat modified by the recent develop-
ment of our highways. The other item which tends
to increase the general efficiency of water transpor-
tation is the necessity of a connected system, where-
by each waterway is so linked with others, that the
maximum possible territory is covered.
One point upon which some misconception mav
still exist is in the question of speed. If the "aver-
age" speed of a freight train be taken from the
time of acceptance of freight until the delivery of
the same at its destination, including all delays at
terminals, sidings, etc.. it will be found to be in
many cases of the order of four miles per hour or
less. Speeds of five to six miles per hour are easilv
obtainable even in constricted waterways, and in
the more open water, ten to eleven is by no means
uncommon. From the point of view of speed, there-
fore, there are numerous industrial centers which
could be served with as great if not greater dispatch
by water than as at present by rail.
We have in this country enormous possibilities
with our natural waterways, and one has only to
look at a map of the United States to realize the
amount of territory already covered by the Great
Lakes and the whole Mississippi system.

Military Transportation
By Maj. L. B. Moody, Army War College
MILITARY transport includes everything from
the movement of troops and supplies in the
home territory to the evacuation of the wounded
from the battle field. In an article of this length
it is impossible to do more than outline some gen-
eral principles and after doing this the remainder
of the available space will be devoted to a phase
which for want of a better name will be called Cross
Country Motor Transport. This particular subject
is selected for discussion on account of its relatively
new place in both military and commercial transport
and because the Army hopes that the present limit-
ed commercial use of such transportation will be
extended so that the types of vehicles in commercial
use will be available in sufficient quantity to pro-
vide for the military demands in an emergency.
Incidentally the development of vehicles intended
for cross country work has lagged far behind that of
the truck and automobile and there are .still many
interesting unsolved engineering problems.
Military transport in the homeland or Zone of
the Interior is supervised by the Transportation
Service of the Army and in war such agencies as
the Railroad Administration, the Shipping Board,
etc., may be required to see that the necessary trans-
portation for military needs is provided and at the
same time that essential civilian requirements are
met. The types of transport are essentially our nor-
mal trains, ships and motors. This transport is
usually operated by civilian agencies except trans-
ports which are preferably manned by the Navy.
The Theater of Operations or territory under the
command of the Commander of the Field Forces
is usually divided into two parts: a rear portion in
which active operations are unlikely such as our
Service of Supply in France, and -a forward portion
in which the armies are actively engaged, called
the Combat Zone. In the rear area the types of
transport still resemble those of the Zone of the
Interior and may or may not be operated by mili-
tary personnel. In the Combat Zone the transport
is operated entirely by the army and it is in this
zone that the special types of military vehicles are
usually found.
Communication to and from the Combat Zone is
controlled by regulating stations to which all sup-
plies and personnel for the armies are sent as re-
quested by the regulating officer, whose duty it is to
call for the material desired by the armies as rapidly
as it can be forwarded from the regulating station
and to co-ordinate the forward and rearward move-
ment of trains in the Combat Zone, so that there will
be no congestion.
When the roads are plentiful and good there will
usually be large reserves of truck trains at the dis-
posal of General Headquarters, which are used in
much the same manner as rail transportation, in-
cluding improvised block systems on the roads and
other careful control to insure that the maximum
use of both roads and trucks is made. Depending on
circumstances, narrow gauge railways of about the
type used in ordinary construction work may be
used to supplement other means of transportation.
It is, however, the transport belonging to the
armies in the Combat Zone and especially the part
of this transport that must be more or less inde-
pendent of roads, that it is desired to discuss. There
is nothing mysterious about the basic principles in-

volved but they have been frequently disregarded
even during the World War and will bear repeti-
tion.
When a unit goes into battle certain minimum
supplies of weapons, food, ammunition, medical fa-
cilities, etc., must be available for instant movement,
and the transportation necessary to carry these sup-
plies is the minimum that should be habitually
assigned to the unit. The additional transport
which is only occasionally required may be con-
solidated or "pooled" in higher units to be available
for use whenever or wherever required, but the ad-
vantage of this pooling of transportation is rather
one of efficiency in use and greater flexibility of the
whole system than any great saving in the total
amount of transportation required for any particu-
lar theater of operations.

Uniformity of type, or standardization, is im-
portant to simplify supply, training, care and spare
parts, but caution is again necessary to see that this
is not carried to the extreme of assigning vehicles
to unsuitable duties just because they happen to be
"standard." It is especially desirable that the vehi-
cles within a given organization such as a regiment
be as far as possible of the same model.
As the front line is approached the types of trans-
port should be relatively more capable of operating

As far as practicable the types of transportation
should be those in ordinary commercial use, but the
mistake of assigning commercial types to duties for
which they are unsuited must be avoided. For ex-
ample, it would be foolish to give an ordinary com-
mercial truck which is designed to run on nwids the
jobs of hauling field guns which must be moved
across any sort of ground to their tiring positions.
The guns would simply not be there when they
were needed.

without roads and the use of unmodified commer-
cial transport becomes more difficult and from the
dawn of history up to a few years ago the draft or
pack animal was unchallenged as a means of trans-
portation for the essential combat equipment of
troops not carried by the soldiers themselves.
Within the last half century increased means of
production and improved transportation have both
increased the size of armies and the kinds and
(juantities of munitions available for their use in
overcoming the enemy. During the World War the
cumulative effects of these changes became fully
apparent and the necessity of supplementing animal
transport by mechanical transport in every possible
way was generally admitted. There is no argument
about making the maximum use of railways,
waterways and motor vehicles on good roads, but
real trouble begins when an attempt is made to re-
place the horse for hauling light cannon, machine
guns, ammunition, etc., in the forward areas where
there are no roads or where the roads may be de-
stroyed. Here no delay can be permitted and a me-
chanical vehicle to be acceptable must be capable
of moving off the road with at least the facility of
the horse.


Page 13
T H H MICHIGAN T II C H N I C
The extent to which such a vehicle can compete
with the horse is largely a function of the unit pres-
Mire on the ground under the driving members of
the vehicle. Fig. 5 shows the unit ground pressure
under various vehicles and explains why certain
vehicles like the tractor shown in Fig. 1 compares
favorably with the horse in movements off the road.
The ground pressures in the lower portion of the
ilustration further show that the present tendency
is towards even lower ground pressures and that a
ground pressure no greater than that under a man's
foot is easily possible of attainment. It is probable
that this is about all that should be reasonably ex-
pected as a vehicle with this unit ground pressure
of about 4 pounds per square inch can go about any
place that a man can walk.
Next to ground pressure the ability to obtain
traction on the ground is of importance in cross
country transportation. This is dependent on two
factors: first, securing the largest and best practic-
able grip on the ground and, secondly, starting the
tractive effort sufficiently slowly so that the ground
in immediate contact with the driving members will
not be torn away by a suddenly applied effort. The
latter requirement appears to be met in practice by
having the vehicle geared down to give a speed of 1
mile per hour or less in low gear.

FIG. 5—GROUND PRESSURE UNDER
VARIOUS CARGO-CARRIERS
Now with the above assumption as to ground
pressures, and contact surfaces it is proposed to run
briefly through the various types of motor vehicles
and their possible applications in the military ser-
vice.
The common rear wheel drive truck needs no in-
troduction. The unit ground pressure under the
driving wheels is high and the gearing is usually
such that maximum torque at the tire cannot be
developed at a very low speed. The vehicle is there-
fore promptly stalled as soon as soft ground is en-
countered, this result being facilitated by the non-
locking differential in the rear axle which permits
one wheel to spin while the other remains at rest.
The vehicle is ob\iously unsuited for use off the
roads except under exceptional conditions, but is
suited for handling supplies on roads up to the

point where they may be taken over by the more
dependable types of transportation used for combat
purposes. Some increased mobility may be obtained
by using lighter trucks and larger tires as the prob-
ability of good roads decreases. For example, in
our service the trucks assigned for general utility
work to army troops are the 3 ton, to corps troops
3 ton and l'&lt;2 ton and to divisions and lower units
l''j ton and -14 ton. The most important commer-
cial developments in this type of vehicle from a mil-
itary standpoint are the growing use of pneumatic
tires and the experimental use of four rear wheels,
instead of two, to decrease the axle loads. Both of
these innovations decrease the unit ground pressure
and should improve the performance of this type of
vehicle on poor roads and increase its value from a
military standpoint.
Several trucks driving on all four wheels have
been developed in this country and two types were
extensively used during the war. These trucks
have considerable ability to operate on poor roads
or cross country, the advantages over the rear
wheel drive truck being the reduced unit pressure
under the driving members, the increased number

of driving points on the ground, usually a lower
gear reduction and locking differentials which make
it impossible to stall the truck simply because a
single wheel loses traction. In our service this
truck is accepted as suitable for carrying a large
proportion of the artillery ammunition and is the
only type of truck considered suitable for use by
the artillery. This type of truck is not, however,
suitable for hauling guns and similar combat uses.

FIG. 7—A COMMERCIAL MOTOR MODIFIED SO
AS TO OPERATE UNDER WATER
We now come to the point where no chances
may' be taken and where animals have been con-
sidered indispensable until a few years ago. The
caterpillar or track-laying type of tractor had a
limited development in this country before the
World War for work on soft farm land, for log-
ging operations, etc., and had been thoroughly
tested by the Field Artillery and Ordnance De-
partment of our Army for hauling guns before our
entry into the war, demonstrating clearly its su-
periority for this purpose over any other type
of motor vehicle. Since then the maximum use
of this development has been made by our army
which has more extensively* motorized its guns with
track-laying equipment than any other, and
very actively assisted the development by both en-
couraging commercial manufacturers and by build-
ing vehicles of its own for experimental purposes.
To date it may be said that the type of vehicles
in existence are fairly satisfactory and they have
replaced the horse on all guns except the 75 mm.
In the A. E. F. it was planned to use these tract-
ors with one-half of the 75s, and this is probably as
far as it would be well to go with existing models
in view of their relatively low development.
Personally I believe all National Guard and
K. O. T. C. 75mm. batteries should be provided
with these tractors on account of the great saving
in cost and the small amount of care required when
not in actual use. as compared with horses, as
well as the possibility of promptly turning out
for drill or service with a full complement of mo-
tive power. A recommendation to this effect was
made by a War Department board after the Arm-
istice but has not been put in effect by the War
I )epartment.
In connection with track-laying vehicles the
question is frequently asked. "Why use a tractor
to tow the load instead of carrying the load on top
of the tractor as in the case of a truck?" The
answer is again one of ground pressure. In a ve-
hicle of any size or power the ground pressure
with any reasonable size of tracks is about the
maximum desirable, say four to six pounds per
square inch. Now suppose a load is placed on top
of this vehicle. The ground pressure will be
raised and the surface of the tracks have to be
increased with a corresponding increase in weight
and perhaps in power. The practical result of this
cycle to date has been that the final loaded ve-
hicle, such as a self propelled gun mount, has had
such a large weight in one mass that it was not
considered satisfactory for service. There are two
exceptions. One, the tank which must be a self
contained unit, and the other, very small vehicles
intended to carry a few hundred pounds of ma-
chine guns, infantry ammunition, etc. In the lat-
ter case the vehicle is so small in comparison with
the surface in contact with the ground that the
unit pressure may run as low as two pounds per
M|uare inch and the vehicle can be loaded up to

say four pounds per square inch without increas-
ing its own weight. The sensible thing to do is
clearly to carry the load rather than to haul it.
Just how large the load should become before it
had better be towed depends a good deal upon
future developments in types of tracks lighter
than those in common use, but the efficient carrv-
ing of other than very light loads is not in sight.
As an example of the point made above a com-

mercial tractor weighing 4150 pounds has been
found fairly satisfactory for hauling a 75 mm. gun
weighing perhaps 3,000 pounds, while the lightest
self propelled 75 mm. gun mount built weighs 10,-
500 pounds. The comparison is not entirely fair
as the self propelled mount had certain special fea-
tures which added to its weight, but the example
will serve to illustrate the practical difficulties in
building efficient cargo-carrying cross-country ve-
hicles.

To sum up, we find in our army field transport
today a large number of commercial rear wheel
drive trucks, a lesser number of commercial four
wheel drive trucks, and track-laying tractors of
semi-commercial design for hauling guns and other
work requiring certainty of getting there. There
is still a large amount of horse transport in the
75 mm. gun regiments and other lower units.
No radical improvements in the trucks are fore-
seen altho the gradual commercial introduction of
pneumatic tires and four rear wheels in lieu of
two will improve them for military use. As long
as the track - laying tractors are only in limited
commercial use, the general replacement of horses
by these tractors will probably not take place, and
no other motor vehicle has the certainty of the
horse. The largest problem in connection with
these tractors is to develop a type of track, the re-
placement cost of which will be sufficiently low
for the tractors to be more extensively used
in civilian life. It is believed this will come in
time as each type of track is better than its prede-
cessors, but the answer has not yet been found.
One other type of tractor which is not at pres-
ent carried in our field army organization is the

wheeled tractor such as the Fordson. It is thought
that in a theatre of operations in which the pres-
ent quota of trucks could not be used on account
of poor roads that it would be logical to replace
part of the trucks by such tractors hauling com-
mercial trailers rather than to increase the horse
transport.
In concluding this brief sketch of military trans-
port, it is desired to again emphasize the great mil-
itary advantage that will result at such time as
a cross-country vehicle capable of replacing the
horse for transport purposes is adopted for com-

Airships That Pass In The Night
By Ralph H. Upson
WHEN the Montgolfier brothers made the first
balloon over a hundred years ago, and again
when the Wright brothers were building the first
successful airplane barely twenty years ago the one
question uppermost was, "Will it fly?"
We have now passed that stage. We know that
any gas-bag light enough and large enough and
tilled with the proper gas, will float and we know
that any barn door will fly if it has enough horse-
power properly placed. The next important ques-
tion to be settled in regard to aircraft was, "Is it
practical, especially for commercial purposes?" This
question also is now answered in the minds of all
who are familiar with the subject.
The question to which we now turn and which
assumes the greatest importance is not, "Will it
fly?", is not, "Is it practical?" but, "What types
and sizes of aircraft will be the most profitable for
different purposes?" In answering this question we
must go far deeper into the problem than we have
ever gone before for there are many new factors to
be considered along with all of the old ones. We
must consider not only such items as speed, safety,
reliability and cost, but comfort, convenience, flexi-
bility and suitability for particular routes and
traffic.
Consider for a moment how even such a seem-
ingly fundamental factor as transportation cost may
be entirely counterbalanced by other considerations.
Take that well known transportation unit, the Ford
car. It is easy to figure that its operating cost
should not exceed five cents per mile with a full
load of five passengers. That makes one cent per
passenger-mile, and yet anyone going on a trip of
any great distance will take the train every time
at a cost of several times greater. How can this
be? Why does anyone take the train? It is doubt-
less easier for you to see the reason without ex-
planation than for me to try to give one. I believe
that to any thinking person the necessity of aircraft
in our constantly expanding civilization is equally
apparent.
Aircraft of some kind is obviously the only way
to speed up our transportation facilities much be-
yond what we are now getting from railways and
steamships; but now, as we have already seen, it is
not only a question of aircraft, but of what type and
size to suit particular purposes. Here again we have
a comparison very similar to that between the auto-
mobile and railway train. Airplanes have recently
performed some remarkable feats. They have been
flown at speeds over 260 miles per hour. They have
reached an altitude of more than 34,000 feet. They
have gone across the ocean and across the continent
without stop; but the airplane is subject to its lim-
itations just as is the automobile or any other trans-
portation unit. Enlarge it, elaborate it as you will,
you cannot get away from the necessity of rather
frequent stops for fuel, the necessity of emergency
landing fields, the difficulty and expense of flying
by night and the fact that comfort and economy in
an airplane reach the peak at comparatively small
sizes.
The airplane will always remain supreme for
light loads, short hauls and extremely high speeds,
but for anything approaching the nature of a cruise
where large loads and long distances are involved,
and speed is not a supreme requirement, the airship,
lighter-than-air type such as the "Shenandoah"
(ZR-1), is the only thing possible to use. Even if
the night-flying problem for airplanes could be sat-
isfactorily worked out, I cannot imagine myself be-
ing really comfortable on an over-night airplane
trip any more than in an automobile. A large air-
ship on the other hand has all the advantages of a
big ocean liner without the discomforts, and at the
same time can go faster than the fastest train. Over
80 miles per hour has been made by the Zeppelin
airships and 100 miles per hour is only a matter of
design. For such qualifications one might be ex-
pected to pay considerably more, but actually the
airship is fundamentally the most economical means
of transportation in existence. I am forced to use
the word, "fundamentally" because we have not yet
reached a point in airship construction and opera-
tion where we can take full advantage of these fun-
damental economies, but they are there none the
less as a few simple illustrations will show.
Take first the matter of fuel consumption. The
"Shenandoah" in its recent trip from Lakehurst to
St. Louis and Chicago had a crew of about 40 men.
It could easily have carried 50 passengers in ad-
dition. On this assumption the total fuel cost for
the whole trip figures approximately three-tenths
of a cent per passenger-mile. With the heavy oil
engines now under development the cost would be
reduced again to a small fraction of this figure. Tn


Page 17
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
other words we might as well say that the fuel cost
of operating airships is practically nothing. This
remarkable fuel economy is also illustrated by an-
other startling fact. An airship could readily be
built today with present known designs and mater-
ials to go around the world without stopping. There
is not a steamship afloat capable of this at more
than a third of the airship's speed.
Another important item entering into the final
cost is the weight of structure which is charged up
to the initial investment. In a modern Pullman
train 9,(XXJ pounds of dead weight are carried

around with each and every passenger, and this of
course makes no allowance for the enormous weight
of equipment represented in the tracks and every-
thing pertaining to them. A fast ocean steamship
like the Leviathan weighs 26,000 pounds per passen-
ger. The trans-Atlantic airship of the future will
weigh less than 1000 pounds per passenger, and
everyone of these passengers will be First Class.
Added to this, the airship requires no right of way
whatever over land or sea, day or night makes no
difference, and the only equipment needed outside
the airships themselves is the main terminals.
I would not have anyone think that
in thus presenting the advantages of
lighter-than-air craft I am trying to
disparage the other. It is becoming
more and more realized every day by
authorities in both of the great branches
of aeronautics that neither lighter-than-
air craft nor heavier-than-air craft is
sufficient unto itself, but that each must
get its fullest development by co-oper-
ation with the other, airships handling
the main traffic over long routes with
airplanes acting as feeders. There has
in fact never been any real question as
to the fundamental advantages of the
two types. There has been, however, a
more rapid technical development of the
heavier-than-air craft during the last
few years, due to the smaller units in-
volved and the possibility of doing ex-
perimentation on full-size units.
Theue are still certain problems which
have to be worked out to give airships
(lighter-than-air) their full advantage.
The principal one of these, to my mind,
is to render the structure of the airship
satisfactorily fire-proof and weather-
proof. The Shenandoah's frame is of
metal but not its envelope. We must
come to a metal hull for airships as we
have come to it for steamships. When
this is accomplished in a practical way
it will mark the most important advance
in practical airship construction since
the first rigid airship of Count Zeppelin.
That it will be done, and done fairl}
soon, there seems to be no logical rea-
son to doubt. In this as in the lesser
problems, the materials and knowledge
are at hand, making it only a matter of
detail, long and painstaking though it
be, leading to the real air commerce of
the future.

The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence
Waterway-Its Present Status
By Gardner S. Williams
UNDER date of January 16, 1922, President
Harding transmitted to Congress the Report
of the International Joint Commission upon the
"Improvement of the St. Lawrence River between
Montreal and Lake Ontario for Navigation and
Power."
Briefly this report contemplated the creation of
slack-water navigation throughout that portion of
the stream which forms the international boundary,
by the construction of dams at Waddington and
at the foot of the Long Sault Rapids, and develop-
ment of power thereby; and the surmounting of
the Coteau, Cedars and Cascade Rapids by a canal
from Lake St. Francis to Lake St. Louis, and the
Lachine Rapids by a canal from Lake St. Louis to
the port of Montreal. This project therefore con-
templates about twenty-five miles of channel 220
feet wide at the bottom and about five miles more
450 feet wide, and is a long way from offering the
open water navigation that might be obtained by
a different treatment of the problem wherein less
than five miles of restricted channel would be nec-
essary.
The Commission, however, recommended "That
the proposed works between Montreal and Lake
Ontario be based upon the report of the Engineer-
ing Board, accompany this report, but that before
any final decision is reached the report of the
Board, together with such comments, criticisms,
and alternative plans as have been filed with the
Commission be referred back to the Board enlarged
by other leading members of the engineering pro-
fession, to the end that the whole question be given
that further complete study that its magnitude and
importance demand*****."
Negotiations have been pending between Canada
and the United States since that time and a few
weeks ago the Canadian Government signified its
readiness to appoint additional engineers to the
Board for the above proposed further study, and a
bill has been introduced by Congressman Mapes of
Grand Rapids to provide for such enlargement on
the part of the United States.
In the meantime a corporation has been formed,
understood to be backed by the Aluminum Com-
pany of America, the General Electric Company
and the Du Ponts, that proposes to carry out the
development of power and a waterway as a private
enterprise, asking only that the two Governments
give it the right to do so.
On the other side of the line the Ontario Hydro-
Electric Commission now expresses itself as de-
sirous of developing the power near Waddington.
thus creating the upper reach of slack water navi-
gation contemplated in the report, but the project
encounters difficulties by reason of the unsettled
question as to the relative rights of the State of
New York and the United States to this portion of
the river. It is the contention of New York that the
United States has only an easement in the river
for purposes of navigation, while the State owning
the land under the river to the international bound-
ary therefore owns and controls the water power.
Judging from the situation at Sault Ste. Marie, the
New York contention appears at least plausible.
It may be worth while to recall that only about
one fourth of the route of the proposed waterway
lies in the internationl waters, the rest being wholly
in Canada. Of the fall in the river available for
power development, out of a total of approximately
220 feet, the international portion of the river em-
braces 98 feet, so of the power that may be devel-
oped only a little over 20 per cent would belong in
the United States.
The average amount of power that can be de-
rived from the St. Lawrence River is at the rate of
about 4,400,000 electrical Horse Powers at the Sta-
tion Boards, which when delivered to customers in
the United States would be reduced about 25 per
cent in transmission and would then represent
about 21,000 million kilowatt hours. It is estimated
in the report on "A Super Power System for the
Region between Boston and Washington" that in
1930 there will be needed from such a system
20,836 million kilowatt hours in the area of New
England, Eastern New York, New Jersey and Penn-
sylvania that is within 300 miles of the St. Law-
rence power sites, and this can be delivered at a
lower cost from the St. Lawrence than it can be
generated by coal.
It therefore appears that so far as utilizing the
power is concerned the sooner it is made available
the better and that the United States can be a cus-
tomer for substantially the whole output if Canada
wishes to sell its share.

Westinghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Company, will each
weigh 200 tons and operate from an 11,000 volt,

The crowning achievement of the year is un-

On the same date speed tests were con-
ducted on a high speed electric passenger
locomotive manufactured jointly by the
General Electric Company and the Amer-
ican Locomotive Company, for the Paris-
Orleans Railway. This locomotive was
of the gearless type having two three-axle
driving trucks in the center and a two-axle
guiding truck at each end. Of a total
weight of 238,480 lb., 159,720 lb. is on the
drivers, and the six motors will develop
a one-hour horse power of 2370. The
nominal trolley voltage is 1500 volts D.
C. This unit will haul trains on the four-
track and six-track sections of the Paris-
Orleans Railway running from Paris to
Vierzon, where speeds of 80 miles per
hour are called for by the schedule of the
present steam locomotive. On the test
trip when the author rode in the front cab beside
the motorman, the start was made from the west end
of the 4.5 mile test track. After passing through
several curved sections, the track ran on a long

rode very smoothly on the test track at 40 miles

to the fact that the weight of the outer end of the
cab is carried on two rollers, which rest on in-

tangent and the speedometer was reading around

standstill on sanded track with the engines coupled
together. Both engineers applied power when Mr.
1'otter lowered his signal Hag. The steam engine
made a slight move forward, as if taking
up slack, but after that did not move the
electric despite all the pressure against
its pistons, and in a few seconds it was
slowly but steadily pulled backwards
down the line. The test was repeated
five times with the same result. Engineer
Sweet, perspiring in the cab of the Mika-
do, took a look at his electric rival, En-
gineer Hull, who leaned his elbow com-
fortably on his cab window sill while he
smoked a cigarette, and remarked "I
could pull the head off your old engine,
but I can't pull the whole power house."

AERIAL TRANSPORTATION FOR LARGE CITIES
B\ WILLUM B. STOUT
IT has been said that ninety per cent of the world's
activity is "the picking up of a weight in one
place and laying it down in another at the right
time." A transportation invention has more influ-
ence on the conduct and living conditions and hap-
piness of mankind than any other type of develop-
ment.
The city of Detroit, in the last twenty years, has
had more influence on the development of man, not
only in his transportation, but in his methods of
living, his channels of thought and his breadth of
brotherly kindness than did Carthage, Athens.
Rome or Jerusalem or any other city in all history.
Henry Ford with his idea of quick transportation
for every man, with the remarkable human ideas
which have grown out from it, has had more influ-
ence on the race and its development, on man and
his thinking, than any other previous human being
has ever done in his own generation. The motor
car increased our speeds from 15 to 60 miles per
hour and our social radius from 10 to 30 miles. Now
comes a new transportation which increases our
speed from 60 to 120 miles per hour in safety, and
the social and business radius is increased propor-
tionately.
The public is acquainted with more lies, accepted
as truths, about aircraft than any other subject, and
has been more extensively misinformed concerning
aviation than any other topic except religion. This
new industry can only be built upon facts. Opinions
are of no value in any industry except where facts
are lacking. Let me state some facts concerning the
safety of aviation.
How many people know that for the past four
years the Air Mail has been operating regularly,
carrying all the morning first letters out of New
York and San Francisco? How many know that
in America this Air Mail operates per day more
miles than all of the air lines of Europe combined?
How many know that during the past two years
the Air Mail has delivered from Xew York to San
Francisco 96.7% on time—more than 20% better
than the railroad has ever accomplished' in all its
history between the same points? These planes
have operated—twenty-one of them in the air every
day—through rain and snow, storm and sleet, with
night-and-day running at times, and even with this
dangerous type of activity have accomplished as
high as two million miles of flying without a fa-
tality.
A similar line, running with passengers from
Xew York to San Francisco, with modern equip-
ment and commercial management could be as safe
per passenger mile as any other form of transporta-
tion and much more reliable in schedule. The Fok-
ker air lines in Europe have operated for four years
between London and Amsterdam without tin-
loss of a ship or passenger. The same original
planes with which the line started are now obsolete
and are being replaced by modern ships with more
commodious and luxurious cabins, while the old
planes, still as good as new, are being turned into
freight and express "tramI) steamers."
These figures alone show that you must throw
out of your mind every preconceived notion regard-
ing aircraft .if you would be up-to-date, and start
building a new line of thought concerning planes,
not as a circus stunt, not as a military means of
sinking a battleship or of bombing troops, but as a
definite industrial transportation the same as you
would analyze a motor bus or motor truck propo-
sition.
Do you know that America holds today every
important record for aircraft: speed, climb, distance,
endurance, altitude, and others? With all of this
true and with the definite knowledge that America
leads the world in aircraft engineering knowledge,
do you know that there is not produced in America
a single commercial airplane nor a flying vehicle
that can go out and support itself in the air finan-
cially as it does mechanically?
"Any industry, so called, that is not self-support-
ing is a Charity. Faith and Hope may be its sisters,
and extremely friendly, but it is still a Charity."
The time has come when we as Americans must
take these engineering facts and translate them in-
to commercial figures; when we must take the red
ink of military aviation and turn it into the black
ink profit of commercial air line operation. We
need no subsidy other than clean business compe-
tition; we ask no favor other than the belief of the
public in the coming of this industrv, provided
proper management is given to it. The engineering
facts and technical problems are now solved and we
are ready for commercial steps.
A commercial plane has been developed with a
one-ton capacity, making a speed of two miles a
minute, built entirely of metal, with a 400 horse-
power engine and yet weighing the same as two
Ford roasters. The wings of this plane are designed
to carry in test a sand load of 16 tons although in
flight it carries but three tons. This plane will
make five miles on a gallon of gasoline with a ton
of load aboard. There are seats for eight passen-

gers, toilet and washrooms, hot and cold running
water, reading and writing tables, cabin accommo-
dations for six, sleeping berths for the crew at night,
dining and card table, galley for preparing meals
aboard, etc. The engine is muffled so that there is
no more noise than in a Pullman car, and every
possible feature for the safety and comfort of the
passengers and crew is incorporated in the machine.
After the manufacture of the plane and the idea
of selling it to the public has attracted its quota of
attention then there comes the idea of organizing
air lines. Suppose one group were to select an air
line from Detroit to X-. They would study this
route, the tonnage available, the firms in each ter-
minal, and the towns between from which freight
and express business might be expected. If it were
a passenger line they would study the number of
people who would be interested in this service, and
then go through all the motions of the organization
of this line, the methods of presenting the stock,
of financing and organizing a company, of selling
the freight and express and passenger tickets, and
acquaint themselves first-hand with all the funda-
mentals of a transportation system without any
precedent to dictate, but with a free mind for the
study of the best thing possible.
The aeroplane is a natural growth from the motor
car but, rather than being an analogy direct as to
quantity production, etc., it is more an analogy to
the motor bus and motor truck industries, which
concern themselves with operation as well as sales.
This will be the first fly-by-night business to have a
serious attention of the securities commission, and
the first blue sky organization to make an asset out
of overhead, but this city alone will submit $15,000,-
000 for aircraft for its own service within the next
ten years, and by that time run up a gasoline bill of
$3,000,000 a year for Detroit alone for the planes
operating out of its air harbors. With but one
plane per thousand people, as Mr. Fokker pointed
out, we would need five square miles of landing
field about Detroit, and this is another item of sales-
manship that can be accomplished.
combined railroads and waterway terminals are de-
signed for the economic handling of freight, the
criticism of "extra handling" is to a large extent
reduced, and when the saving due to the rail and
water method is taken into account, the net result
would in many cases show a cheaper cost of trans-
portation.
Looking to the future therefore, it would seem
to be a logical method to follow the laws of coop-
eration and not blind and often unintelligent war-
fare, between the various means of transportation.
After all, the general prosperity of any country or
part of a country must depend, in the final analysis,
upon cheap transportation; and if each method of
transportation be content with handling such com-
modities upon which it can make a decent profit,
instead of grabbing blindly at everything and en-
deavoring to knock out the presumed competition,
the net result will, and one might say, must re-
bound to the benefit of the transportation com-
panies and the public at large.
Co-operation In Transportation
(Continued from page 10)
In the very near future our railroads will need
some relief if the whole country is to follow its nor-
mal course of development, where then can we turn
for this desired relief? To the highway and water-
way. The recent development in highway trans-
portation has made certain combinations of the
waterway-highway scheme not only possible but
very desirable. By suitable arrangements whereby
freight can be loaded directly from the vessel to the
motor truck and thence to the factory, costs of
handling may be considerably reduced. Where

through limestone rock and was originally con-
structed 300 feet in width and 22 feet deep. It is
now widened to 450 feet and this work, is is ex-
pected, will be completed in 1925. This provides a
downbound channel separate from that for upbound
vessels, where prior to its construction vessels
bound in both directions were obliged to navigate
through a narrow, tortuous and rockbound section
of the Detroit River.
A similar condition existed in the St. Marv's
River below Sault Ste. Marie where a like result
was accomplished by the construction of the West
iVeebish Channel which was completed in 1908 and,
similarly, part of this, 5000 feet, was through solid
rock. This channel is 133/( miles long, 300 feet wide
and 21 feet deep.
The results of these improvements, manifested
in the larger vessels and the coordination of loading
and unloading facilities and ships, and bringing
about larger cargoes and quicker turnaround, have
been reflected not only in the handling of a traffic
that could not be cared for by any reasonable in-
crease in railroad facilities, but in the marked reduc-
tion of rates at which these commodities are car-
ried. Since 1888 the rates on iron ore from the head
of the lakes to Lake Erie ports have decreased from
$2.11 to a rate of 80 cents per ton prevailing during
the past year, and it has been in recent years as low
as 50 cents. Coal can be carried from Buffalo to
Duluth for 45 cents—a cost less than a laborer
would charge to shovel it from your sidewalk into
your cellar.

THE COLLEGE CHRONICLE
*
Items of Interest to Michigan Engineers
Conference of Engineering Deans
On January 25 and 26, the division of Deans and
Administrative Officers of the American Society
for the Promotion of Engineering Education con-
vened here for a two-day session for the purpose of
discussing improvement of the curricula of engine-
ering colleges in America. The importance of the
assemblage was well indicated by the presence of
some seventy officials representing over fifty en-
gineering institutions in the United States and
Canada.
The work of the first session on January 25, was
to discuss the subject, "The Length and Content of
the Curriculum." The systems fostered by each of
six prominent schools were presented by the re-
spective heads of the institutions. Dean Arthur M.
Green presided at the meeting.
The first speaker, Dean Raymond of Iowa, out-
lined the course of instruction there and spoke of
the intentions of increasing the length of the course
to five years. The plan is awaiting the decision of
the directors of the University.
Dean H. J. Hughes of the Harvard Engineering
School compared the merits of the four and five
year systems at that institution, where the five year
course includes some work in the Arts college.
Then Dean Mortimer E. Cooley, of the College
of Engineering and Architecture, explained the
Michigan plan of engineering education and spoke
of the affiliation system which is used in connec-
tion with smaller technical schools throughout the
state.
The system in vogue at Columbia was expounded
by Dean G. B. Pegram, who emphasized the value
of the combined curriculum in helping a student to
determine his fitness to be an engineer ere he pro-
ceeded too far into engineering to warrant his
changing his course of study. At Columbia the en-
gineering students take three years of the regular
arts course including certain prescribed subjects, and
then three years in the engineering school. At the
end of the first year in engineering the student re-
ceives a Bachelor of Arts degree and at the termin-
ation of the third year in engineering, the sixth
year in all, the student receives the degree of Bach-
elor of Science.
Dean E. J. Caustland of the University of Mis-
souri explained the plan followed at that school,
where two instead of three years of preparatory
work are required.
In the absence of President A. C. Humphreys of
Stevens Institute, the presiding officer read a let-
ter from him showing the president to be in favor
of the single engineering course and opposed to
the five year method because it led to over-devel-
opment of the theoretical side of study.
The next meeting dealt with a subject no
less interesting. President C. R. Richards of
Lehigh University discussed "The Place of Re-
search in the Engineering School." Reference was
made to the connection between research in the
technical school to the progress of industry. The
next topic dealt specifically with "The Relation of
the Engineering School to the Industries," and was
presented by Mr. M. W. Alexander of the Na-
tional Industrial Conference Board. The report of
the Board of Investigation and Cooperation con-
cluded the active work of what Dean M. E. Cooley
said was one of the biggest and most original in-
vestigations in education, and bids fair to mater-
ially revolutionize the educational system for en-
gineers. On the evening of the twenty-sixth, a
banquet was tendered to the delegates at the Un-
ion, where President Burton spoke before the body
about the problems facing educators in schools of
higher learning.
It will not be long until the effect of these rigid
studies will make themselves felt in our courses
here at Michigan, and then may the results prove
as good as intended by these far-see-
ing men, who seek to fill the demand for broad-
minded engineers.
Improving Our Education
How often during our sojourn at the Engineering
College have we encountered the criticism of noted
men of our profession as to the inadequacy of our
education? In many of the technical journals and
in addresses, men whose position in life demands

T HE MICHIGAN TECHNM C
respect for their opinions, have repeatedly advo-
cated improvement of engineering education as a
means of increasing the value of the engineer to
society, the nation and the world. From the maze
of discussion has arisen a movement which bids fair
to revolutionize our training.
This movement has been made possible by the
donation of $108,000 by the Carnegie Corporation
to the Society for the Promotion of Engineering
Education. This aid makes possible an extensive
survey and study of methods used in engineering
institutions throughout the country. The society
has been fortunate to secure Mr. W. E. Wickenden,
formerly Assistant Vice-president of the American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, as Director of
Investigations. The national Engineering Societies
have indicated their interest by appointing counsel-
lors to advise and co-operate with the Board of In-
vestigation and Co-ordination. In addition to this,
the United States Bureau of Education is now
gathering data on present engineering curricula
throughout the country.
Such co-operation of various bodies and assimila-
tion of information gathered from such widely dif-
ferent sources certainly will go a long way to ac-
complish the desired perfection of our preparation.
Conference of Rail Executives and Faculty Men
In the interest of what seems to be a lack of
attention to railroad opportunities among students
of engineering schools, and to induce closer con-
tact between the educators and railroad adminis-
trators, the Committee on Co-operative Relations
with Universities, of the American Railway En-
gineering Association, met with the College fac-
ulty men. in a two-day session on January 24 and
25. If for no other reasons, the gathering was a
valuable one in that it made clear just how each
of these factions could best aid the other with the
knowledge and experience assimilated through the
different viewpoints.
The proceedings of the meeting follow: Mr.
\V. B. Storey, president of the Atkinson, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway, led a discussion wrhose aim
was to stimulate a greater interest on the part of
railroad officers in aiding the universities to de-
velop the best possible presentation of technical
subjects. Following this, a discussion of a better
means of bringing to the universities the results
of the executives' deliberations was led by Mr.
II. R. Stafford, vice-president of the Chicago.
I'.urlington and Quincy Railroad. Mr. C. W. Cush-
ing, engineer of standards of the Pennsylvania
System, made very interesting a discussion on how
to bring to railroads the benefits of a technical ed-
ucation. Prof. H. E. Riggs, of the Civil Engineer-
ing Department of the University, presented the
topic of stimulating interest in the science of trans-
portation among Engineering students. The ad-
vance of transportation facilities has been an im-
portant factor in making possible large concentra-
tions of wealth into the corporations, which in turn
produces on a large scale production basis to make
a better product for a lower price. St&gt; this field of
transportation is relatively a new one and offers
great opportunities.
Mr. E. T. Howson, western editor of the Rail-
way Age, spoke on methods of educating students
and the public regarding the value of transporta-
tion to the nation. Other discussions on similar
subjects were held under the leadership of Mr. M.
S. Ketchum, dean of the department of engineer-
ing of the University of Illinois, and Brig. Gen.
C. H. Mitchell, dean of the School of Applied Sci-
ence of Toronto University. Many other promin-
ent figures took part in the conference.
The following morning was given to addresses
by Prof. E. E. Day of the economics department,
and Prof. John S. Worley of the Transportation
Engineering department. The committee was given
a banquet at the Union at which President Burton
and the Board of Regents were present.
The success of the meeting is indicated by a
statement from Prof. Riggs: "Unques-
tionably both elements composing the committee
benefited. By covering the ground as we did, a
clearer idea of the problems and needs of each fac-
tion was obtained. Although no definite policies
were advanced, matters have so formed themselves
that we will be able to proceed in our educational
system with more intelligence in view of future
needs."
The New Location of the A utomobile Dept.
With the passing of the engineering shops to
their place in the New East Engineering building,
comes the realization of a long anticipated desire
to gather in the odds and ends of this department
from the halls and corners of other departments
into a suitably organized laboratory. The rooms
formerly devoted to foundry and forge shops have
been adapted to the storage of exhibitions, auto
and plane motors not in immediate use in the lab-
oratory, besides giving much additional floor space
enabling more work to be carried on at once than
previously. This gives all the old Engineering
Shops to this department with the exception of tin-
rooms formerly occupied by the wood shop and
machine shop, where the Architects now linger to
draw, and the two rooms under the clock tower
where the ROTC infantry headquarters are now
located.

THE MICHIGAN T E C H NIC
Annual Junior Engineers Banquet
Following the precedent set by the class of '24,
the Junior Engineers have voted to continue the
annual banquet which is to be held at the Michigan
Union. The event is scheduled to occur some time
during the first week in April. Class officers at-
ready at work on the plans, promise that it will lack
nothing in the way of speakers and entertainment.
The Union Fair
The Michigan Union Fair held in the Yost Field
House on the seventh and eighth of March for the
purpose of raising funds to finish the Union swim-
ming pool, possessed all characteristic features of
the typical county fair by virtue of the splendid
cooperation of nearly every organization on the
campus except the Women's League. Booths
cleverly arranged to tantalize the curious crowd en-
tirely surrounded the vast Field House, and the
basket-ball floor in the center of the group was
used for dancing whenever the orchestra could be
heard above the barking of the ballyhooers. Circus
acts including tight rope walkers and tumblers held
the crowd with stunts that one would never believe
were hidden in the midst of our cosmopolitan cam-
pus. As to the success of the affair, there is no
doubt, and the hearty support given it should go
a long way toward the quota of twenty thousand
dollars yet required to give Michigan men an op-
portunity to get their feet wet some place other
than on the campus walks.
R. 0. T. C.
Once again the sign reading, "Reserve Officers
Training Corps Headquarters," is poised on an ex-
quisite but temporary edifice; this time it is the old
campus power house. One would hardly believe that
a building could serve so many purposes as has
this power house—evaporator lab, highway lab—
and ROTC barracks. The entire rear portion of the
building, formerly a double story affair, has been
floored to make two stories of ample height, the up-
per one of which will be used for a drill-hall and
inter-company basket-ball games. The lower story
will serve as a rifle range and will replace the re-
cent quarters of that activity in the engineering
building.
The infantry has been given a room all its own
in the old shops building where they have sand
tables for the purpose of map work and ground
problems. It is believed that the present augmen-
tation of the facilities for instruction and the in-
crease in benefit to be derived from enlistment will
increase the student interest and enrollment of the
body.
Michigan at Fort Monroe
We have all experienced the thrill of spirit when
any of the Michigan teams march on to the scene
of action to compete with another school for the
glory of their Alma Mater; and it is this same spirit
although not so evident, that is exhibited when a
band of Michigan students get together at camp.
Thirty-five Michigan R. O. T. C. men were together
in Battery B at Fort Monroe, Virginia, last summer
in the advanced Coast Artillery camp. Among re-
presentative students of thirteen other colleges, they
took first place in small arms competition, in com-
petitive drill and in the swimming meet. The only
Expert Rifleman's award in the camp was possessed
by one of our men. Major Aurthur of the Univer-
sity R. O. T. C. was battery commander and Cap-
tain Dunne instructed in gunnery.
The daily routine called for a cessation of slum-
ber at 5:45 A. M., breakfast, one hour drill, two
hours of working on field guns, mortars and big
rifles, one hour of lecture, and then lunch. Two
hours of gun work was required in the afternoon
and then the men were through for' the day. The
non-commissioned officers and orderlies were chos-
en weekly, thus giving everyone a fair opportunity
to show his ability both in commanding a large
unit and such lighter duties as sweeping up the
mess hall. Several weeks were spent in the prepar-
ation of the ten inch rifles and mortars before they
could be fired. French 75 MM. and G. P. F. guns
were among the other equipment at camp, and on
these the men learned some of the fundamentals
of firing. This work, small arms practice and trips
either to flying fields or navy yards, constituted tin-
activities.
The camp was managed so as to make the work
a pleasure and the men never lost an opportunity
to swim at the coast, go horse-back riding or take
in dances and shows. The unanimous opinion of
those men who attended camp was that the six
weeks were a great success, and on the whole the
experience was as beneficial as it was enjoyable.

To Freshmen and Sophomores who are taking up
Aeronautics, attention is here calletl to an excep-
tional opportunity recently opened to students
through the R. O. T. C. It provides that any
Aeronautic Engineering student who has finished
his basic work and is enrolled in the advanced
group, may attend one Advanced Camp of the Air
Service, at which both theoretical and practical in-
struction in flying is given, provided they have
passed the physical examination. The chance is a
lare one to get some valuable experience. More in-
formation as to the details of this offer will gladly
be furnished by Major Carpenter at the R. O. T. C.
office.

This work is being conducted under the direction
of Professor A. E. White.
Michigan Gas Association Fellowship. This fel-
lowship has been maintained continually since 1900
with the exception of a short interruption during
the War. The subject of the fellowship this year
is the Gasification of Powdered Coal. The holder
of this fellowship is Mr. 11. C. Chamberlain. He
ib working under the direction of Professor A. H.
White.
In addition to the major researches and fellow-
ships at the University of Michigan to which refer-
ence has been made, work is continually being done
upon a number of smaller problems. These vary
widely in nature and scope. The following list
shows to a partial extent the variety of the work:
Chemical analysis of ferrous and non-ferrous
metals.
Metallographic examination of ferrous and non-
ferrous metals.
Water analyses.
Coal and other fuel analyses,
Analyses of lubricants.
Test of paints.
Tests of an automobile.
Tests of rotary pumps.
Endurance tests of bearing material.
Physical tests of ferrous and non-ferrous metals.
Physical tests of wires, ropes and cables.
Physical tests of creosoted woods.
Determination of thermal properties of metals.
Development of thermal measuring instruments.
Investigation of wood preservation and treat-
ments.
Investigation of causes of failure of machine
parts.
Investigation of paper mill problems.
Investigation of corrosion in water me'ters and
pipes.
Investigation of properties of nicotine.
Engine design problems.
Standardization of electrical measuring instru-
ments.
During the fiscal year ending June 30, 192,3,, work
was done on 52 such problems. In some cases only
a few hours was required for the solution of a prob-
lem while in other cases months of labor are re-
quired.
During this time there were sixty-five persons
engaged by the Department of Engineering Re-
search to carry on its research program. They
ranged in rank from student assistants to full pro-
fessor. The salaries aggregated $14.500 for this
period.
We are informed by the department of Engineer-
ing Research that during the fiscal year ending June
30, 1923 the Colleges of Engineering and Architec-
ture expended $607,613.27. Of this sum $582,171.02
was paid out in salaries and contingent expenses to
persons engaged almost exclusively in instruction.
The balance, $25,442.25, was the amount available
for new equipment used for both instructional and
research purposes, divided as follows:
College of Architecture $ 2,314.67
Department of Chemical Engineering 5,019.27
Department of Civil Engineering... 1,945.84
Department of Electrical Engineer-
ing 3,553.11
Department of Engineering Shops. . 3,615.76
Department of Mechanical Engin-
eering 5,058.93
Other departments 5,934.67
TOTAI $25,442.25
Each of the major departments is in turn divided
into subdepartments. For instance, in the Depart-
ment of Civil Engineering there are six such de-
partments. If this allotment of $1,945.84 was di-
vided equally among the six subdepartments each
would then have received for new equipment
$324.30. Can one picture research work of any
quantity being performed in the field of hydraulic
engineering or in the field of sanitary engineering
with such a limited budget for new equipment, even
if the total sum were devoted to research equip-
ment alone?
The statements made should in no sense be mis-
construed as indicative of partiality in the distribu-
tion of funds or as indicative of failure on the part
of our departments to perform constructive work.
Were the expenditures for every department and
subdepartment analyzed as closely as we have
analyzed the hydraulic and sanitary engineering
subdepartments, the same limitation of funds would
develop. Further, the number of graduate students
in the two subdepartments named is indicative of
the respect and appreciation in which those en-
gaged in the instructional work are held by the
engineering profession.
Station WCBC
Since the January issue of the Michigan Technic
appeared, containing an article lamenting the lack
of interest in the engineering college in radio tele-
phony, station WCBC, the experimental station of
the Electrical Engineering department, has broad-
cast several programs of general University news
and results of basket-ball games. The apparatus
was designed and built by E. E. Dreese, instruc-
tor in electrical engineering. Lewis H. Holland.

graduate, and Lewis H. Dorf, 24E. (Juietly and un-
pretentiously, the work has been carried on since
the Christmas holidays and, judging from the re-
ports which have come in, the efforts have been
amply rewarded.
The set uses the principle of amplification of the
output from a master oscillator tube. The voice
currents from the microphone are amplified and im-
pressed upon the modulator tube which in turn
varies the amplitude of the oscillations of the mas-
ter oscillator. The Heising system is used. These
three tubes, each of five watts capacity, are in them-
selves a complete radio telephone sending set. In
station WCBC, however, the output from the
sending set is passed thru four fifty-watt amplifier
tubes, making a total capacity of 200 watts. The
high plate potential is obtained from a new General
Electric synchronous motor-driven generator set.
Each of the five-watt tubes requires 500 volts on the
plate; the 50 watt tubes require 1000 volts.
The University radio station has had many re-
ports of favorable reception ranging from Presque
Isle, Maine, to Topeka, Kansas. Most of the reports
came from New York state and Long Island. Since
the antenna current measured only 1.5 amperes
during these tests the operators are very well
pleased with the results. Mr. Dreese stated, how-
ever, that the antenna was at this time used in a
way which was very unusual and for which it was
not intended.
Since the set is primarily an experimental enter-
prise no policy for its use and control has been
formulated and no definite programs announced. It
is available, however, to any University organiza-
tion having legitimate right to its use. The labor-
atory is located in room 105, old Engineering build-
ing, and the studio is just across the hall.

"Projective Geometry With Applications to
Engineering," by Prof. Peter Field.
Reviewed by D. K. Kazarinoff
The preface of the book tells us that it grew out
of a course given by the author at the University
of Michigan. One finds in the ninety-three pages a
condensed exposition of the elements of projective
geometry, illustrated by numerous technical applica-
tions. In the author's opinion, "A course which
does not call attention to some of the applications
gives a one-sided and imperfect view of the subject."
The theoretical part of the book concerns plane
homology, the complete quadrangle, the cross-ratio,
the fundamental properties of projective ranges and
pencils, conies, projectively defined involution, pole
and polar and the null system. Among the applica-
tions the following topics are discussed; linkages,
funicular polygons, the elastic curve of a beam, the
stress diagram for a given framework, the stress
ellipse and the kern of a cross section. Forty-two
exercises throughout the text add much to its value
as a text-book.
Being simply written the book can be recom-
mended to any engineering student appreciating
the abstract thought, as well as to students of pure
mathematics, for its throwing light on various prac-
tical applications of projective geometry. Brief as
it is, Professor Field's book will stimulate the read-
er's curiosity and lead him to more profound study.

Some of the most interesting things brought out
at the meeting were touched upon by Mr. Anthony
Fokker in his discussion on Commercial Aviation.
He told of the network of airplane routes that were
already in use on the continent and, of the lack
of them in this country, also of the ever increasing
demand for faster transportation for business men.
He further pointed out the reason for the backward
position of this country being due to the lack of
necessary aircraft terminals. Due to the World
War a great many of the foreign cities had military
landing fields which are used for commercial work
now. Mr. Fokker thought that it would be conser-
vative to estimate one airplane to every thousand
inhabitants in the not distant future.
Mr. Ralph Upson touched upon the future of the
Dirigible in which he told of the possibilities of an
all-metal ship and displayed samples of thin sheet
metal which they are attempting to use for this
construction. He further pointed out some of the
advantages of lighter-than-air craft over heavier-
than-air craft. On the continent Zeppelins have
a record of 400,000,000 passenger-miles without
a casualty. The Dirigible will find its field of
operation commercially in heavy loads and long
distances. The cost of operation can be brought
down more comparable to that of railroad transpor-
tation after it reaches a commercial state. Mr. Up-
son briefly discussed the uses of hydrogen and hel-
ium for inflation purposes and seemed to favor
hydrogen on account of its greater lifting power.
He cited that the fire risk was less than 0.1 per cent.
In the ordnance session of the program Brigadier
General Joyes, U. S. A., exhibited moving pictures
of all types of new ordnance material, explaining
the developments that have been made in such
equipment since the armistice. The outstanding
features of development were a tank with track
layer treads and twin propellers which could travel
by land or water; a Ford equipped with balloon
tires which made it possible to travel all kinds of
country; a Martin bombing plane laying a smoke
screen, and a stroboscope which might be described
as a large helmet on top of a tank made of projectile
proof material and having vertical slots around its
entire periphery. When in use, the stroboscope is
revolved at a high rate of speed so that vision is
practically as clear as though no metal was there
and yet it is bullet proof.
Tn the paper given by Mr. Henri Perrot, consult-
ing engineer, Paris. France, on four-wheel brake
design, he cited the necessity of quick car control
in our ever increasing heavy city traffic. He also
touched upon various important phases which are
essential in four-wheel brake design. Most of the
engineers present seemed to feel that four-wheel
brakes are here to stay. Thomas Midgley in his
paper on "Radiation Characteristics of the Internal
Combustion Engine" covered the work which had
been carried on at the Dayton Research Laborator-
ies in this connection. By means of a sight-hole to
the combustion chamber with a quartz window, a
stroboscope, a thermopile in an evacuated tube, and
a very delicate galvanometer, they were able to
study the variation in radiation from the flame as
they are affected by mixture ratio, detonation and
the distribution of this radiant energy.
The Aeronautical Society
As was shown by the Union Fair, this society has
much concealed up the proverbial sleeve. Through
his affiliation with the commercial concern, before
entering the University, Roger F. Becker 26E, of
this society has obtained for the University a prac-
tically new Flying Boat which is to be used for the
purpose of instruction in design and construction,
and not flying. The plane has seen barely ten hours'
flying time and will certainly go a long ways toward
giving our aeronautical students a glimpse of the
real thing instead of pictures and drawings as here-
tofore. It will be stored for exhibition and instruc-
tion in the room now occupied by the ROTC rifle
range on the second floor of the engineering build-
ing. The president of the Aeronautical Society is
M. B. Bleecher 24. a man who saw no little exper-
ience as a pilot of commercial planes, and who is
displaying competence in bringing speakers of note
to the University. The chief engineer of the Fokker
Company was secured to speak recently and gave
a fascinating account of the history and develop-
ment of aviation.
In keeping with the latest and most interesting
development in the game, the society has nearly
completed plans for the construction of a Combina-
tion Glider and Light Plane. As far as is known
this is the first attempt to combine the two. It is
hoped that this combination glider and light plane
will be entered in both glider and light plane com-
petitions next fall, at Dayton. The distinctive fea-
ture about the design is the fact that it makes it
possible to attach the motor and operate as a plane,
or it may be operated as gliders of recent fame have
been, in a strong wind, with the motor detached.
To encourage the interest of boys of Ann Arbor.
the Aero Society is sponsoring a model plane tour-
nament among the Boy Scouts of the city, the win-
ners to be given cups as awards in addition to be-
coming eligible to the Xational Mulvihill Model
Plane Tournament in the fall, at Davton. Ohio.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The New Generator Set
With the installation of a new 50 KW motor-
generator set, a great improvement has been made
in the power service to the electrical laboratory.
This unit converts the alternating current power
supply into a direct current of practically unvarying
potential, and greatly facilitates accurate laboratory
work.

The driving unit is a synchronous motor, wind-
ings being supplied in the periphery of the rotating
field for induction starting. The motor is first
brought up to speed on approximately half-voltage,
the field is then excited and after the motor has
pulled into synchronous speed full voltage is ap-
plied. On the generator end. 110-120 volt direct
current is available. Two armature slip-rings are
provided for connections to the reactance coil of the
Dobrowolsky system. The set is manufactured by
the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing
Company.
Since the speed of the set depends upon the fre-
quency of the power supply, a very uniform con-
stant potential is now delivered to the laboratory.
The Architect.*' May Party
STARTING from a humble beginning in the
Assembly Hall of the 1'nion where the only
feature of decoration was a group of modern
candelabra, the May Party has become the most
beautiful party on the campus. Each of the years
that the party has been given a different decora-
tive scheme has been tried, and each time with
greater success, until last year the greatest heights
of decoration were reached in the Egyptian tem-
ple scheme of decoration. It may be interesting
for one who is not acquainted with the workings
of the school to be told a bit about the making of
a Party.
The committee having been appointed, a com-
petition is arranged in which each student of the
school takes part. This is a required part of each
design course. The competition consists of a sketch
in which the students present their idea of what
would be a satisfactory solution of a decorative
scheme. All of the drawings are then hung and
judged. The ten best so selected are returned to
their owners who draw a more detailed scheme or
perhaps elaborate and restudy their original. From
these ten the final is judged, or if one is not good
enough or if there are points of merit in more than
one, these are combined and the result so obtained
is the one used as the final scheme.
The design is then worked up to a larger scale
and studied at this scale and within a week or so
the actual building of the party is well under way.
The school is divided off into groups, each with its
own foreman and the work is assigned from a gen-
eral work committee. Literally thousands of rolls
of crepe paper were used two years ago in the
building of the party, while building paper was
used last year.
Of course, as can be expected the freshmen do
the menial work of cutting paper and pasting and
gluing and painting. The sophomores are the fore-
men of the groups and the juniors and seniors do
the more important pieces of building as well as
all of the designing.
All of the design is carefully labelled and rolled
up until two days before the party when it is all
taken over to the Gymnasium. Here the actual
erection is started and the entire school takes a
hand at it with the result that in a day and a half
all of the decorations are up and the party is fin-
ished.
It requires much work on the part of those who
are in charge and a great deal of labor on the part
of the rest of the school but everyone feels well re-
paid for it.
This year the party will be a costume ball and
there is no doubt that the beauty of the decorations
added to the color of the costumes will create a
ball of such beauty that it can easily be ranked as
the finest party ever given by the Architects.
. / rchitecfs' Smoker
A number of the faculty and students of the Arch
itectural Dept. met at the Union for a smoker and
general good time Tuesday evening. Feb. 26th.
The Architect's six piece orchestra furnished
music for the occasion, and "did their stuff well."
A saber match was held between Harold Smellie.
graduate, and Arthur Felver *2(,E. Smellie is fenc-
ing coach at Michigan being a former captain of the
Annapolis fencing team. Felver is considered one
of the best swordsmen at Michigan and their snappv
act was greeted with much interest.
John E. Baker '24A. and M. M. Brown '25L. dem-
onstrated their skill on the parallel bars. Their
stunts were accorded much applause, and added to
the success of the evening.
The speaker of the evening was Mr. Eames, head

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of the appraisal department of Smith, Hinchman &amp;
Grylls, Detroit. Mr. Eames is a recognized author-
ity on contracts and legal documents pertaining to
building. He has had some of the largest appraisal
operations in the country, including the Lincoln
Motors Plant, the new twenty-eight story Buhl
Building, estimated at about $6,000,000, and the
new Hudson Stores. At one time Mr. Eames was
associated with Dean Mortimer E. Cooley, assist-
ing on appraisals. He comes from Chicago and has
had nearly thirty years' experience.
The subject of his talk was "The business rela-
tions of the Architect," in which he touched on
some of the essential points in regard to contracts
and the importance of making correct reports. He
spoke of the rights and duties of the Architect citing
interesting examples from his own experiences, and
possible disputes which might arise between the
Architect and the contractor.
Mr. Eames's talk was instructive as well as inter-
esting and the society was fortunate indeed in ob-
taining him as a speaker for the occasion. At the
conclusion of the program cider and doughnuts
were served.

A rate of two cents a bushel for carrying wheat
from Duluth or Chicago to Buffalo is common under
normal conditions, but grain rates are subject to
more frequent fluctuations under the law of supply
and demand than are the rates on ore and coal,
which are usually established by contract at the be-
ginning of the season and charters made at the es-
tablished rate for the season's needs.
These improvements, upon which the Federal
Government has expended such large sums and
which are of such direct benefit to all of the people,
are menaced by the withdrawal of water from Lake
Michigan through the Chicago Drainage Canal.
Permit was granted by the War Department in
1900 to turn into the sanitary canal 250,000 cubit-
feet of water per minute. Admittedly a much great-
er quantity has been taken and persistent effort has
followed to obtain from the Secretary of War
authority to increase the amount. This was suc-
cessively denied by Secretaries Root, Taft and Stim-
son and in 1913 suit was brought by the United
States Government to restrain the use of more than
the authorized 4,167 cubic feet per second. It was
nearly ten years before the case was brought to act-
ual decision, which was in favor of the Government.
Appeal was taken and is pending in the Supreme
Court. Action has also been brought in the Supreme
Court by the State of Wisconsin against the State
of Illinois and the Sanitary District of Chicago,
charging that the diversion of any water through
the Drainage Canal is illegal and should be en-
joined. Legislation has been introduced in Congress
to authorize the extraction of 10,000 cubic feet per
second which the Sanitary District is now said to
be taking contrary to law.
The interest of the people of this country in such
proposed increased withdrawal of water from Lake
Michigan, because of its effect upon the present
cheap transportation on the Great Lakes, is readily
apparent when it is taken into consideration that
each inch of reduction of lake levels compels a re-
duction of from 75 to 100 tons of cargo for every
vessel each trip. Engineers have estimated that the
withdrawal at Chicago has already affected the traf-
fic of the Lakes to the extent of from 2% to 2y2
million tons of cargo annually on the basis of the
freight movement of 1923 and nullified vast sums
expended by the Government for the improvement
of the channels.

a vehicle is coming, and it is left to the readers'
imagination as to how such a machine with main-

bar. Any lateral motion of the truck moves one of
these rollers up the corresponding inclined surface,
thus lifting the weight of the cab and transferring
this weight to the rail against which pressure is be-
ing exerted. When the roller returns to the normal
position the cab quickly comes to rest at the center
point and there is no oscillation. The real "joy-ride"
of the tests was reported to have taken place on
December 2nd when Mr. Potter and Mr. Batchelder.
the designer, went down the track at 105 miles per
hour.
In connection with all these test runs records
were taken on the twenty-five otheograph ties, the
recording cylinders giving a graphical record of the
action of each locomotive wheel on the rail and
showing the amplitude and characteristic of both
the vertical and transverse thrust of all the wheels
on each tie. Mr. Potter has very kindly sent the
Engineering College complete sets of fifty records
each from nine selected runs, as follows:
Run No. 23: Paris-Orleans electric, locomotive.
Speed 105 m. p. h.

Echoes from the Graduates
Horace Williams King
Horace Williams King was born fifty years ago
in Big Rapids, Michigan. He received his prepar-
atory education in the High School of that city
and entered the Engin-
eering College of the
University of Michigan
in 1891. His fondness
of mathematics togeth-
er with a love for out-
door life inspired him
to study Civil Engin-
eering from which
course he graduated in
1895.
Mr. King commenced
his engineering career
in Big Rapids, his
home town, where he
was engaged in city
engineering and sur-
veying. After a short
interim as rodman for
the Sante Fe, Prescott
and Phoenix Railway,
Arizona, he entered the
employ of the United
States Surveyor Gen-
eral, making maps of
government surveys of
land and other topo-
graphical work. He
spent many subsequent
years in the service of
the Government. It
was while engaged as
transit-man for the
Isthmian Canal Com-
mission in Nicaragua
that he first met Arthur
Powell Davis, inter-
nationally famous irrigation engineer, and formed
an enduring friendship.
At the conclusion of the Spanish-American War,
when peace conditions had been reestablished in

the Philippine Islands. Governor Taft applied to
the United States Government for a number of
engineers to make preliminary surveys for the con-
struction of Manila
Harbor. King was one
of the first twenty men
sent and was in charge
of the work. With the
exception of about a
year spent in building
six miles of the Canton-
Hankow Railroad in
China, he continued in
the Manila Harbor
work as United States
Assistant Engineer un-
til September, 1904.
Having penetrated so
far into the Orient, and
feeling the need for a
respite, Mr. King de-
cided to circle the globe
and the following eight
months were spent in
travel. He devoted
four weeks to sight see-
ing in Europe.
From May in 1905
until September 1912,
Mr. King was engaged
in irrigation work with
the United States Re-
clamation Service. He
was in charge of pre-
liminary work, con-
struction and operation
of the diversion works
and supply canal for
the Umatilla Project in
Oregon and supervised
the investigation and reconnaissance of many other
projects. He was also Engineer for the Western
Land and Irrigation Company, in the construction
of their water system and made a survey and re-

port for the State of Oregon on the Columbia
Southern Irrigation Project.
After an active and extensive service in the
field, Mr. King was called in 1912 to the chair of
Professor of Hydraulic Engineering at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, which position he still occu-
pies. His wide experience in engineering and his
contact with men in the profession is reflected in
his ability to teach and to make friends with every
one he meets. He is the author of the "Hand-
book of Hydraulics," a section on Irrigation and
Drainage in the "American Civil Engineers' Pocket
Book" and co-author of King and Wisler's "Hy-
draulics." Professor King is quiet and unobtrusive
in manner, yet firm and determined in his decisions,
as many of us who have been 'on the mat' before
the Committee on Delinquent Students know only
too well. He is an engineer in the truest sense of
the word and Michigan is proud to recognize him
as one of her prominent alumni.

THE ivy of tradition is a slender sup-

Qood Friends
from now on
THERE'S good news at the plant. The pro-
duction engineer and the chief inspector
have buried the hatchet—their feud is ended
—and all because of Ground-Form Cutters.
For months Jones, the engineer, thought
that big Mac, the chief inspector, was rejecting
gears in order to give production a black eye.
"They're good gears, Mac," protested
Jones. "What's the matter with them?"
"Sure they're good, if you take them one
by one," replied Mac, 'but in big lots they're
not uniform enough to pass inspection."
And so the war began; Mac grew more
careful, and Jones felt sure that Mac had a
personal grudge against him.
Then Jones discovered Brown &amp; Sharpe
Ground-Form Gear Cutters. He heard that
they would increase production and at the
same time improve the quality of his gears.
He tried a few. Now, all his gear cutting
machines are equipped with Ground-Form
Gear Cutters.
Mac and Jones are good friends now.
Gears come through faster than ever and
rejections are few and far
between.
Here is the booklet that
proved so valuable to Jones.
You can avoid his difficulties
by getting acquainted with
Ground-Form Cutters be-
fore the full responsibility
of production falls on your
shoulders. Write today for

TRV DISADVANTAGE OF POOR LIGHTING.
As thousands of our industrial plants are operating
today with poor lighting and in some cases with extremely
bad facilities, it would seem that the importance of the
subject of lighting has not been given the serious consid-
eration by those responsible for such conditions.
Poor lighting is one of the most serious handicaps
under which a manufacturing establishment can operate.
First of all, poor lighting is the cause of a large number
of accidents in industrial plants; and it is singular that
accident reports do not yet properly classify the hazards
of poor lighting, which in many cases is the primary cause
of an accident attributed to what is really a secondary
caus,e. Safety engineers and other officials who make acci-
dent reports should always consider the condition of the
lighting when working up a report of accident causes, for
it plays an important part in a great many casualties and
is apt to be overlooked. All accidents due to poor lighting
are accidents of neglect, and are preventable. The poor
lighting accident hazard is clearly chargeable to manage-
ment and not men. It is a difficult matter to make such
progress with Safety First in a plant which has neglected
to provide one of the fundamental requirements of accident
prevention—good lighting.
Probably no one single factor connected with the
equipment of a plant so directly affects the efficiency and
Inefficiency as the quality and quantity of the lighting.
The curtailment of production of ail working under tht
disadvantage of poor lighting represents a big loss each
day; the poorer the lighting the less able is the working
force to function efficiently. Quality and quantity both
suffer, representing a preventable loss wholly removable
by improving the lighting.
Under poor lighting condition, we cannot expect and
rarely do we find an orderly, clean factory. Darkened
places encourage careless habits and workers are often Isd
to deposit discarded articles or material which should be
deposited elsewhere. The eyesight of those who attempt
to use their eyes continually in insufficient light, below
nature's demands, is often affected. Too much light, such
as is furnished by bright, unprotected lights, is as harm-
ful as too little illumination; both are fundamentally
wrong. Nature's own illuminant, daylight, is unequalled
for our requirements of lighting.
The eye is best suited to daylight in the proper
quantity. Sun glare should be avoided, and in the dark-
ened hours proper artificial illumination provided. Day-
light should be utilized to the fullest extent. It is supplied
free in abundant quantity for our use. Modern invention
has supplied a means whereby the interior of buildings ran
be lighted by daylight, and all the advantages secured
which is furnished by good lighting at the smallest cost.
Industrial buildings should have as much wall space
as possible devoted to windows fitted with Factrolite Glass,
which insures the maximum amount of daylight and which
prevents the direct rays of the sun from passing through
as it properly diffuses the light.
If you are interested in the distribution of ligr&lt;

CRANETILT NON-RETURN STEAM TRAP
CRANETILT STEAM TRAPS COST LEAST
If you will compare steam traps not by the sizes of their
piping connections but rather by their capacities to
discharge condensation, you will find that the prices of
Cranetilt traps are as low as any other dependable trap.
Per year of service, Cranetilt traps are an economy be-
cause of their great durability. They cannot be classed
as "cheap" steam traps, however. The accessibility
of their vital parts and their high efficiency make
them the most satisfactory traps that money can buy.
Write for your copy of "Condensation," Crane
booklet No. 164, which gives you many useful facts
about the installation and care of steam traps.

ELI EL SAARINEN
WITHIN' the last year the field of architecture
has received some of its greatest contribu-
tions in the development and design of buildings
such as skyscrapers or other buildings with similar
tendencies. The most distinguished contributor in
this field is Kliel Saarinen of Helsingfors, Finland,
who, through the efforts of Prof. Emil Lorch, was
secured as the visiting Professor of the College of
Architecture and who conducted classes from the
middle of last November until the present Spring
recess.
These classes were for advanced students or
graduates and limited to a small number so that
each one would be given individual attention and
also absorb the ideals, philosophy and methods of
approach of this man who for years has been con-
sidered one of Europe's greatest architects and who
has also rapidly gained the favor of all who know
of him in this country. Professor Saarinen first
gained recognition in this country through his de-
sign for the Chicago Tribune tower in which he
placed second.
The students in these classes took separate prob-
lems in town planning, designing of community
centers, campus layouts and other building groups
of which Prof. Saarinen is considered one of the
foremost authorities. This work was made doubly
interesting thru the making of clay models of each
project so that the mass, planning and detailing
could also be studied in the third dimension.
The last problem upon which the class worked
as a unit was the design for a future college of
Architecture. This was a very interesting problem
as it was one of which the students had a thorough
knowledge of the requirements, conditions and also
the added incentive of working on a problem in
which they were vitally interested.
It was designed as an ideal unit, containing many
accommodations which usually are not integral
with present architectural colleges but nevertheless
very necessary. It was also designed so that sec-
tions could be gracefully added to the other por-
tions as it is well understood that the project as a
whole would be beyond the means of the LTniversity.
This was a determining factor, as one might see
from the many campus buildings which are now
under construction, the ends where portions are to
be added being very ugly in their temporary state.
The model is completed and may be seen in the
architectural draughting room in the southwest
wing of the Engineering building.
The students all feel that it was only through
Prof. Saarinen, who did most of the work necessary
in completing the model and the drawings, that
the project was completed so satisfactorily. He
instills a vigor, simplicity, and nicety of detail into
his design which is peculiarly his own. It has been
a great privilege and pleasure to the students in
his classes to work with him.
At present he is working on a solution of the
Detroit traffic problem which promises to be a
most farseeing and satisfactory project if one might
judge from his previous plan for Chicago.
He sails for Europe in June and will be one of
the judges at the Olympic games before he returns
to Finland and his home. It is hoped that he will
return again soon and give inspiration to other
students of architecture as he has done this past
winter.

The Embarrassing Wealth Of Asteroids
By Louis Allen Hopkins
IX 1772, before the discovery of Uranus and Nep-
tune, Titius had observed that if to each of the
numbers 0, 3, 6, 12 and 48 there is added 4, the sums
obtained are approximately proportional to the dis-
tances from the Sun to the several planets. This
series of numbers became known largely through
the writings of Bode and today is called Bode's
Law. Though there never has been any scientific
basis for Bode's Law it has played no negligible
part in astronomical discovery.
At once it was remarked that no planet corre-
sponded to the fifth position (24 -f 4 = 28). This
so-called gap had earlier attracted the attention of
Kepler who had filled the place with a fictitious
planet. But, in 1781, Herschel discovered Uranus
whose distance from the Sun could be represented
very well by an extension of Bode's Law through
one additional term (96 + 4 = 100). This fact gave
confidence to the idea that a planet must fill the fifth
position. The interest in the matter was so great
that an organization was formed to search system-
atically for the missing planet. Communication be-
tween- scientific men in those days was slow, and be-
fore a knowledge of the organized search reached
him, Piazzi at Palermo had discovered the planet
on January 1, 1801. He called it Ceres. This dis-
covery was heralded as one of great significance
partly because it added a new member to our solar
system but mostly because Ceres filled the gap in
Bode's Law.

THE ASTEROID BELT BETWEEN THE ORBITS
OF MARS (M) AND JUPITER (J).
But, much to the astonishment of the astrono-
mers, a second planet was discovered in 1802 which
also filled the gap, and in 1804 a third, and in 1807
a fourth was found. This multiplicity of new
planets led to much discussion and speculation.
They were all small; indeed their sizes were not
known with any reliability until many years later
when Barnard measured them with the great tele-
scope at the Lick Observatory. He found their
diameters to be 485, 304, 118, and 243 miles respec-
tively. But all agreed at the time of their discovery
that their distances from the Sun were approximate-
ly equal and their dimensions very small relative
to the other members of the solar system. It was
thought for many years that these four small plan-
ets were fragments of a larger exploded one and,
indeed, this theory has not been entirely abandoned
to this day, though the more careful scientists have
discarded the idea. A patient search for more aster-
oids now began, and it proceeded without reward
until 1845. New discoveries then followed with
some rapidly. Among those who were successful
in the search was Professor Watson who discovered
twenty-two while astronomer at the University of
Michigan.
In 1891, Wolff at Heidelberg, first applied photo-
graphic processes in the search. The plan was to
expose the plate in a telescope which turned with
the stars so that a planet moving among the stars
would be recorded as a worm-like image. This
method, applied since by astronomers, has produced
remarkable results not only in discoveries of small
planets but in finding other and temporary visitors
to our solar system. A modification in this photo-
graphic method has been used advantageously in
later years in the search for small planets, viz., to
move the telescopic camera with a velocity approx-
imately equal to that of the asteroid, thus securing
the record of a much fainter and smaller planet as
a dot on the plate, while the images of the stars
appear as scratches. By these photographic pro-
cesses the small planets discovered have reached
almost a thousand. In fact, their number is now so
great and their motions present such a variety of
problems that they are an embarrassing wealth for
scientific study.
The search for asteroids has also been produc-
tive in other ways. For the discovery of a new
planet the observer needed very accurate star maps
whose making led to elaborate surveys of the whole

sky; while the surveys, in turn, required advance-
ments in precision of measurements and refinements
in instruments. The study of discovered planets and
the desire to follow their motions and identify them
led to mathematical progress both in the prediction
of celestial phenomena and in theoretical investiga-
tion into the consequences of various suggested

laws of gravitation. Especially there resulted an
intensive study of the problem of three or more
bodies subject to Newton's law. This last problem
has been an outstanding one for centuries. Only
particular solutions have been found. It is said to
have made Newton remark that it gave him the
headache.
Another of the remarkable results of the search
was the discovery of the asteroid Eros in 1898 by
Witt. Its orbit is unique in that it becomes, at
times, our nearest neighbor except the Moon. The
best times for its observation occur at intervals of
about thirty years. The next most propitious op-
portunity will be in 1931. Astronomers and math-
ematicians are already planning to devote much
time and thought to its motion and physical appear-
ance. From observations made in 1931, it will be
possible to-redetermine the scale of our solar sys-
tem and to-obtain a more accurate measure of the
distance from the Earth to the Sun and, consequent-
ly, a better conception of the size and shape of our
galaxy. Also, a study of the variation in the light
of Eros should yield a better knowledge of its shape,
size and albedo. At present some think it is an ir-
regular plate, others, that it is like a dumb-bell, and
still others look upon it as a miniature planet and
satellite as our Earth-Moon system. From every
point of view, Eros presents a fascinating object
for mathematical and physical research.
But before the number of asteroids became so
great, indeed when only a relatively small number
were known, Kirkvvood of Indiana, following the
idea of gaps which had been so productive, ob-
served that if the times of revolution of the aster-
oids around the Sun were arranged in order of mag-
nitude and then divided by the period of Jupiter's
revolution there were no asteroids corresponding
to those ratios whose numerator and denominator
were commensurable. As the discoveries of aster-
oids continued, certain of these (commensurable)
gaps became relatively more pronounced. And to-
day, when the motions of so great a number of
asteroids are known, there are no observed small
planets which revolve about the Sun twice while
Jupiter completes one revolution, or three times
while Jupiter revolves twice, etc., that is to say, gaps
exist corresponding to ratios of the form,
n+1; (n = integer).
However, there are asteroids whose periods form
with the period of Jupiter fractions very closely ap-
proximating these ratios. Such small planets are
said to be of type 2/1, 3/2, 4/3, Poincare called
them "Characteristic Planets."
Among those of type 2/1 are 1913QX, 1914UK.
Andromache, Turandot, 1914TZ, 1908DC. Mancu-
nia and Gerda. Most writers consider Hecuba as of
this type, but such a classification would then argue
that a number more be included. There are six
asteroids of type 3/2, viz., Hilda, Simeisa, Ismene,
Bononia, Venusia and Chicago. The last is named
from the fact that it was discovered at the time of
the Chicago World's Fair. A study of the motion
of characteristic planets, thus, takes into its sweep
fifteen or more small planets.
There are two other physical phenomena in our
solar system which have some bearing on these
characteristic types. First, two of the satellites of
Saturn, viz., Titan and Hyperion, complete revolu-
tions about their primary in periods whose ratio is

approximately 4/3. The problem differs from the
asteroid case in the fact that the outer satellite
is much smaller than the inner one, while in
asteroid motion the great disturbing force eman-
ates from Jupiter whose orbit is outside the asteroid
belt. Second, the Cassini division in Saturn's rings.

DOCKS AT MANAOS
The City of Manaos, Brazil, has a floating dock which is probably the only thing of its kind In the world. The structure
floats on large steel drums and is anchored to the river bed by means of chains attached to automatic windlasses.
The rise and fall of the river here is about forty feet every year. The largest ocean boats dock
here the year round
Engineering Potentialities Of
The Amazon Region
By Morris K. Jessup, '24E
NOTE: — Morris K. Jessup, '24E, compiled the material for this
article while on a trip to South America in 1923. He was Field
Assistant in an exploring party sent to the Amazon Region by
the United States Department of Agriculture to investigate
sources of crude' rubber. Dr. Carl D. LJiKue of the Botany
Department of the University was in charge of the expedition.
THE Amazon river drains a territory whose area
is about equal to that of the United States.
Most of this area is a vast wilderness and there are
large portions whieh have never been seen by civil-
ized man. Some of the world's best agricultural
lands lie at the headwaters of this river and its
tributaries, and the greater portion of the whole
expanse of land drained by this system will produce
agricultural products of one kind or another. The
mountains in which rise the remote branches of
the tributaries contain minerals the extent of which
no man knows. The forests which exist there now
have a wealth of trees which will produce some of
the most beautiful lumber in the world, and in
quantities which are practically beyond calculation.
The Amazon is the home of the rubber gathering
industry and the "Fine Hard I'ara" rubber com-
mands the highest market price in spite of strong
competition from plantations of the far East. There
arc enough palm trees to furnish palm oils for all
the soap the world will need for decades. Fancy
nuts grow in great abundance. There are regions
ideal for cotton, for tropical fruits, for corn, and, in
short, tor most of the agricultural products which
the world needs.
You at once want to ask whether it is possible
to transport- these things to foreign markets, once
they are ready to ship. The answer is yes, and again
yes. Ships from New York can at all times go a
thousand miles up the Amazon and at high water
season they can go nine hundred to a thousand
miles farther up any of a number of tributaries.
River steamers of considerable capacity cover
thousands of miles of the river system the year
round. Brazil may well boast the possession of the
most extensive and most ideal system of natural
waterways in the world.
Potentially the Amazon drainage area may be con-
sidered one of the most wealthy of any in the world.
And yet it is almost totally undeveloped. There are
probably less than five million civilized beings in
the entire region. If you look at a map you will at
once see the multitude of rivers and it is more than
probable that in most cases, the width of the lines
which mark the river locations covers more country
than is actually known along the rivers. The ma-
jority of these people who do live there are doing
little if anything toward the development of their
land. In fact there are many who are even hindering
development in ways which are more or less in-
direct. Among these the politicians are the most
numerous. As compared with the countries of the
North Temperate Zone one may say that the Ama-
zon country, or Amazonia as the natives call it. is
an undeveloped empire, an empire ruled by vege-
tation.


Max, 1924
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
There are several reasons for this undeveloped
state, among which two or three are prominent and
worthy of mention here. First of all the people are
of low intelligence generally and do not know or
care to know the value of their own country, much
less how to prepare its products for the world mar-
kets. Thrift is not encouraged among the poorer
classes since they are taxed to the limit for the
personal gain of those in power. Foreign enter-
prises are similarly taxed so that progress is made
only with difficulty and discouragements are many.
The second important reason for the lack of devel-
opment is that the outside world has not needed
the resources of Brazil badly enough to make sys-
tematic efforts to obtain them. It is always eco-
nomical to use home products as long as they may
lie-marketed more cheaply than foreign produce
may be shipped in. One reason why northern races
have not done more in Amazonia is that they fear
tropical life. Much has been written by tourists
and some explorers to show that living conditions
there are intolerable, but these reports have, in the
main, been untrue. It seems to be natural for the
human animal to magnify any discomforts he may
have encountered provided there is the slightest
possibility of some one believing him. I have yet
to find a tropical climate which is not more livable
than that of the Great Lakes region in our own
United States.
The time is about here when the world will want
the Amazonian products and it will then take steps
to get them. The time is already here when the
world could very well use many of these products
and a great deal of money is to be made by some-
one in the near future by importing them.
When Amazonia starts to develop it will do so
with one of the grandest rushes that history has
ever known. Being far behind other localities of
the earth as far as progress and commercial devel-
opment are concerned, the country is bound to de-
velop rapidly when contact is once formed in earn-
est. One might draw the parallel case of a hot body
brought into contact with a cold one. The flow of
heat between them will be more rapid than in the
case of a cold body in contact with one which is
merely warm. Amazonia will, in all likelihood, go
through ;is much development in twenty-five years
once it gets started as the United States has gone
through in a hundred years.
When this development starts the engineer will
be the most prominent feature of the landscape.
His services will be not only desired but demanded.
He will be present in thousands and will be con-
structing roads, buildings, ships, schools and dozens
of other things necessary in the growth of a vast
empire. Here will be a country developed efficiently
and scientifically, being unique in history in this
respect. It will be the engineering type of mind
which will solve the riddles of communication,
transportation, efficient production, sanitation, im-
migration and good government.
The need for the engineering type of mind will
be obvious to anyone who gives the problem a
moment's thought. Where the progress of a land
is destined to be so rapid there will be problems
which will have to be met by minds which arc-
familiar with handling the affairs of great enter-
prises and capable of directing the government and
welfare of an intricate mixture of races. If the out-
come is to be anything but chaos, turbulence, and
continued degeneration of races, development will
have to be directed by those whose judgment can
be based on the experience of building nations such
as out own. Men who can see and weigh all phases
of a problem and arrive at a balanced answer will
have to answer the questions of a rapidly rising
empire. Men who will build bridges for tomorrow's
traffic, even while repairing the washouts of yes-
terday, will have to teach ways of fair play to poli-
ticians whose only thought is personal power and
graft. The need will be for men who can think
quickly, estimate correctly, and correlate the many
components of a new and growing civilization. The
big opportunities will be for engineers, and for en-
gineers who can at the same time be statesmen.
Perhaps it might be well to outline briefly some
of the problems which are to be met and the con-
sideration of which may as well be started now.
The first consideration of such development will be
transportation. Most of this will be by water and
the designing of boats for all kinds of river use
will be a big item. There will have to be boats as
large as ocean going freighters operating on the
lower rivers and smaller boats running to the vari-
ous heads of navigation. There will have to be
thousands of launches for the upper waters where
the draft may not be more than three or four feet.
The largest part of the freight will be carried by
boat. There will be no need for long cross con-
tinent railways and the reason for this will be forth-
coming with one look at the map. Any railroad
would have to bridge hundreds of rivers in cross-
ing Amazonia. This does not mean, however, there
will be no need at all for railroads. Short lines may
be useful in many places for short hauls to the
rivers from regions not immediately accessible by
boat. In general these lines will be not more than
one hundred to six hundred miles long. Electricity
will probably play a large part in the development
of these roads. Fast express and passenger ser-
vice can be and is likely to be carried on in the
air. The country lends itself well to hydro-airplane
travel. Where there is so little need for railways to
carry freight, the air transportation of mail and

people will have much more opportunity to grow.
There will be many possibilities for the use of trac-

WATER FALLS OF SAN ANTONIO
The falls of San Antonio are the first falls of the Madeira
River. They are Just above Portovelho and near the Bolivian
frontier. The total fall is twenty-five or thirty feet at
this point. A dam located some seven or eight miles
below would make available a head of fifty
feet or more, and the volume would be
sufficient to furnish a great amount
of power
PALM NUT FACTORY
The sources of vegetable oils in Brazil are almost unlimited.
Here is an Italian enterprise which cracks palm nuts and
sends the meats to Italy where the oil is removed and
the product sold to the world for making soap, etc.
No other nation is at this time making extensive
developments along this line altho it would
be much cheaper for American interests
to develop their own supply
NATIVES MAKING CART WHEELS
Riberalta, Bolivia, boasts one of the largest wireless stations In
South America but the natives have very few modern con-
veniences. Here are two men chopping a set of cart
wheels from a solid piece of timber. The work is
laborious but the wheels last a long time when
they are once made. There are many trees
large enough to make these wheels from
tors and motor trucks in hauls of moderate length
for carrying produce to the waterways.
Roads, as we know them, are not at this time
existent in Amazonia. The Highway Engineer will
find much work and many problems in supplying
an area the size of the United States with good
and permanent roads which will sustain heavy
traffic.
With the problem of transportation will go that
of communication. This is already beginning to
be felt. Just now there are a few sub-fluvial cables
in the lower system .of rivers but they are not very
extensive. It remains for engineers of communica-
tion to determine whether this form shall be devel-
oped or not, and if not, what is to take its place.
Wireless telegraphy is also used but likewise to
a limited extent. There are perhaps five or six high
powered stations in Amazonia and none of lower
power. The writer can prove the statement that
it once took a message twenty-six days to go from
Portovelho, on the Madeira River to its destina-
tion in Manaos, a distance of nine hundred miles
by river. There can be no doubt of the need of
American engineering ability on this job. Wire
telegraphy is practically not in use in the Amazon
country, except along the two or three short rail-
ways which are already there. It seems as if wires
are rather inefficient where the plant life has such
a grip as it has in Amazonia. In the regions above
Manaos the river boats make up the major portion
of all means of communication and for many places
they are the only means available.
Problems of power development in the Amazon
country will be somewhat different from those of
Xorth America. Coal may or may not be obtainable
there. At present it is imported from England.
There is plenty of room for exploration for coal and
for petroleum. Water power may be had only in
the upper rivers near the Andes and their foot hills.
Here all rivers drop rapidly and for many miles
there are rapids which will furnish more power than
can be used locally. In a north and south direction
the territory of rapid waters extends for hundreds
of miles. Will it ever be possible to develop a
super power system over this tropical area? The
wind and the sun also are potential sources of
power. Xear the Atlantic coast the wind is pretty
constant in velocity and always keeps about the
same direction. Everyone has some idea of the
strength of the tropical sun. It still remains for
someone effectively to harness these agents and
make them work as we are already making the
water falls work here. To the south of Amazonia,
in the mountains of Chile, water power development
is already going at a good pace. Power developed
in the mountains will still be from two to three

Electrons And Engineering
By N. H. Williams
A few years ago the able-bodied man who spent
his time in counting electrons and measuring
their masses and velocities was accorded a certain
measure of sympathy but not much appreciation.
Molecules, atoms, and electrons were considered
as purely hypothetical, the names affording a con-
venient means of expressing certain theoretical
notions that, to some extent, seemed to have an
experimental basis but no bearing upon practical
problems.
The reception of knowledge usually goes through
three stages of development. First there is violent
opposition to the new idea, which in the old days
led to persecution and bloodshed, then a period of
mild tolerance follows, and finally a state of mind
is reached which is expressed in the remark "That
is what I have always believed." The attitude of
scientists and of thinking people in general toward
the electron theory of the structure of matter has
reached this third stage, and yet it is only about
fifteen years ago that some chemists were studiously
avoiding the use of the words atom and molecule,
probably on the ground that the atomic theory
was unnecessary if not unfounded. Today the num-
ber of molecules in a given volume of gas is known
with greater accuracy than the number of people
in a city and the number of electrons per atom of
the different elements is definitely determined. The
century old puzzle of fractional atomic weights has
been solved by the discovery of isotopes, the separa-
tion of which by physical means has been accom-
plished in many cases. The field of electron physics
has grown to such proportions that it is like a new
branch of science, and such it seems to the man who
acquired his knowledge of Physics fifteen or twenty
years ago and has not had the opportunity of con-
tinuing his study in that field. When the physicist
has made a few more discoveries and has developed
a few more devices for utilizing them, we shall
probably have a new branch of engineering and the
electron engineer will make his appearance.
I have been asked to point out to the readers
of the Technic a few of the applications of pure
science in engineering and especially to mention the
contribution which this new branch, known as
Electron Physics, is making or may be expected to
make.
Because the science of illumination concerns all
the people in a very vital way, it furnishes one of
the most interesting examples of how a vast com-
mercial enterprise may be born and raised in a
physical laboratory. It was about forty-five years
ago that Mr. Edison produced the first vacuum
lamps, using a carbon filament. During the next
twenty-five years improvements were made in the
vacuum and in the structure of the filament so
that the efficiency was gradually raised until the
power expenditure was about three watts per
candlepower. The industry was dependent upon
lamps of this character with little prospects of fur-
ther improvement so long as carbon filaments were
used. This was the situation when the physicists
of the Research Laboratory of the General Electric
Co. undertook an exhaustive study of the problem.
The laws of Planck and Wien showed the relation
of radiated energy to wave length for different tem-
peratures and made it possible to compute the lum-
inous efficiency of a radiating body. The upper
limit of luminous efficiency must be considered as
determined by the nature of the eye. The visible
spectrum is only about an octave in length, hence
most of the energy from a radiating body is not
within the visible range. If the eye were not sub-
ject to this limitation but were equally sensitive
to light of longer wave length so that its range
extended over two octaves instead of one, the lum-
inous efficiency of most of our present sources of
light would be more than doubled. The luminous
efficiency of sun light is about 14% while that of
the carbon lamp is considerably less than 2%. The
problem confronting the physicist was the deter-
mination of the factors entering into an increased
efficiency and then the development of means of
accomplishing the increase. The record of the re-
searches connected with the development of the
tungsten filament and the present Mazda lamp is
a fascinating chapter in the history of the contribu-
tions of pure science to the welfare of mankind.
It is no small matter that the world is now getting
five times as much light from a given expenditure
of energy as was possible with the earlier forms
of incandescent lamps and yet the fact that 6%
represents the present luminous efficiency indicates
to the physicist that his work in this field is not
completed. However he realizes that he must look
for future achievement "beyond the third decimal
place" and that the next increment of progress in
this line is likely to come as a result of most pains-
taking researches in the field of atomic structure
and electronic orbits within the atom. Accurate

knowledge of the conditions under which ionization
and radiation in gaseous conductors occur is being
obtained and the intensive study now in progress
is likely to yield important results in the future.
The electron tube is coming to be almost as well
known as the incandescent lamp, but, at present,
most people associate it with radio reception with-
out realizing that its usefulness is not thus limited.
We are beginning to appreciate what radio already
means in the life and thought of our time and it
is easy to speculate on its future developments and
the unique position it will hold when some of our
dreams are realized.
.Anything that can properly be called a vacuum
tube is of interest to the radio engineer, but it may
not be so apparent that vacuum tubes have any
applications that might interest the engineering
profession in general. It was early observed that
the three electrode tube used as a detector and
amplifier in radio reception would set up oscilla-
tions of a frequency determined by the circuit to
which it was connected. This fact suggested the
possibility of using a tube for a high frequency
power supply and later on when the space charge
limitation of current came to be understood, tubes
especially designed for power purposes were con-
structed. The new tube was named the pliotron to
distinguish it from detectors and amplifiers already
in use. It is the pliotron oscillator that has made
broadcasting possible. Work in the design and
construction of these tubes has progressed steadily
from the start. The original oscillating tube had
a power output of a fraction of a watt. The latest
product is a water cooled tube that is designed to
furnish 100 kilowatts.
The protection of power circuits against the re-
sults of short-circuits has always been more or less
difficult, depending upon the amount of power in-
volved. It will be of interest to consider how
the electron tube may be operated as a circuit
breaker with no appreciable increase of current
when the system is short-circuited. If a thoriated
filament is used in a two electrode tube, the thorium
diffuses to the surface of the filament, forming a
layer one molecule deep, The filament then emits
electrons copiously at a temperature far below that
at which pure tungsten produces any appreciable
emission. The gas in the tube becomes ionized
and there is a flow of positive ions toward the fila-
ment. In case of short circuit, the ions are acceler-
ated and bombard the filament with sufficient en-
ergy to remove the molecular layer of thorium from
the filament and it instantly becomes inactive.
When in this condition the tube is a nonconductor
and the circuit of which it is a part is open. If
normal conditions are restored, more thorium dif-
fuses to the surface and the tube again becomes a
conductor. This operation may be repeated over
and over again indefinitely, the ammeter showing
less than 1 % rise of current when the circuit is
shorted. It will be seen that there are serious limi-
tations in the use of such a device but it is of inter-
est as a suggestion of future possibilities.
Another type of electron tube which has proper-
ties resembling those of a circuit breaker has been
described by Dr. A. W. Hull and is called the axia-
tron. The filament is a straight tungsten rod at
the axis of a cylinder which serves as the plate of
the tube. These electrodes are mounted in a glass
tube and the tube is thoroughly evacuated. The
current in the filament produces a magnetic field in
the form of circles with centers at the filament. The
electrons starting from the filament are deflected by
this field in planes passing through the axis of the
filament and for some critical value of filament cur-
rent they fail to reach the plate and the electric cur-
rent through the tube is cut off. If the filament is
heated by alternating current the cut off happens
twice per cycle when the filament current rises to
some certain value. If the tube current is passed
through the primary of a transformer, the second-
ary voltage will be of double frequency. If, how-
ever, the tube current is passed through a coil whose
terminals are connected by a condenser, the coil
and condenser, acting as a tuned circuit, are shock
excited twice during each cycle and the system os-
cillates with a frequency determined by the induc-
tance and capacity of the circuit. Thus the tube,
if supplied with direct current, becomes an alter-
nating current generator of any desired frequency.
Two such tubes may be used to advantage, in which
case it is possible to handle voltages as high as
100,000 volts and convert thousands of kilowatts to
alternating current power with an efficiency of 95 %
or more. The reverse process, i. e. the conversion
of alternating currents of high voltage to direct
currents is accomplished by means of a pair of keno-
trons. Tubes have been used in this way for a num-
ber of years in the production of current for the
operation of X ray tubes and for other purposes in
which a direct current of high voltage is required.
The two operations just mentioned, both made
possible by electron tubes, suggest to the electrical
engineer that there may be a solution for the diffi-
culties encountered when alternating current is
used for long distance transmission. Capacity effects
would no longer prohibit the use of underground
cables and inductive reactance would disappear if
high voltage transmission could be accomplished
with direct currents.
The axiatron, described above, is a magnetically
controlled tube that operates only with very large
currents. Another magnetically controlled tube

SOME PROBLEMS OF THE FISHERY INDUSTRIES*
By DONALD K. TRESSLER, Ph. D. '13
T T XTIL recently hut few researches looking to-
vJ wards the improvement of fishery products and
the utilization of by-products had been conducted.
During the past ten years, however, many of the
processes of preservation of fish and fishery products
have been improved, and while there is much room
for improvement in practically all of the methods
of fisheries, a beginning has been made in the appli-
cation of science. Many millions of pounds of valu-
able food, and many thousands of tons of non-edible
fish which might be converted into excellent animal
feed and fertilizer are wasted annually. For the
most part the commercial methods have developed
empirically without definite knowledge of the un-
derlying scientific principles. For this reason the
held offers tremendous opportunities to the well
trained scientist willing to give a few years to the
study of these problems.
The problems are legion and are widely varied
in nature. It is impossible to say which is the most
important problem, for no one knows where any
investigation will lead. For instance, when the
study of methods of salting fish in warm climates
was made, it was found that the physical properties
of the salted fish could be controlled largely In-
varying the amount of calcium and magnesium
compounds present in common salt. Further, it was
learned that pure salt produced soft flexible fish
with an appearance and taste resembling that of
fresh fish.
A number of fishes are little utilized today either
because of unfounded prejudices against them or
the ignorance of the general public regarding their
qualities. Investigations have proved that many
of these fishes are excellent food, e. g., shark, dog-
fish, or grayfish, squid, many skates and sablefish.
Hundreds of other fishes entirelv unknown to the

on methods of preventing it.
general public, doubtless are of equal or greater
value for food. Widespread advertising campaigns
to familiarize the public with the qualities of these
fish should be conducted. This is especially impor-
tant in the case of the dogfish and shark, as these
fish have been permitted to live almost unmolested
for centuries. They are ravenous eaters and many
of the larger sharks are exceedingly destructive to
fishermen's nets. The gravfish have the habit of
following the cod and haddock; at times more of
these are caught than groundfish, and are usually
thrown back into the sea.
The edible qualities of all fish and other marine
animals existing in sufficient quantities to be of eco-
nomic importance should be investigated. Compar-
atively little is known concerning the vitamin con-
tent of fish and fishery products. The discovery of
the presence of large quantities of fat-soluble vita-
min A in fishery products other than the liver oils
would immediately increase consumption of these
products. Drummond has found this vitamin in
whole herring but he has not indicated in which
part of the fish the vitamin is concentrated.
The modern science of nutrition has shown that
all proteins are not of equal value because of de-
ficiencies in certain amino acids. Osborne, Okuda
and others have determined the hydrolytic cleavage
products of the proteins of cod, halibut, porgy and
bonito muscle and have indicated the nutritive
value of these proteins, but a great deal remains to
be done, a-; the proteins of many fish have not been
studied.
When the vitamin content and the nature of the
proteins of fish have been ascertained, fishery prod-
ucts may be given their proper place in the diet
Doubtless such investigations will indicate food
values hitherto unsuspected.
\ problem of great importance, the solution of
which was only recently undertaken, is the exam-
ination of fish as a source of insulin, the substance
recently discovered to possess valuable therapeutic
properties for the cure of diabetes. Many fish pos-
sess pancreatic glands containing large quantities
if this invaluable remedy. Various species of sharks
have recently been examined to determine their
relative value as potential sources of insulin. The
shark has been found to contain this therapeutic
substance in a form which can easily be extracted.

If this investigation proves the shark to be a valu-
able source of insulin, the fisherman will possess a
new source of revenue.
Another problem of great industrial importance
which is being solved is the freezing of fish in brine
by a small, low-priced equipment. Its successful
solution will enable the fishermen to quickly freeze
small quantities of fish economically. Much im-
portant research work along this line has been
carried out in the Fishery Products Laboratory of
the Bureau of Fisheries. A moderately priced con-
tinuous brine freezing apparatus is being perfected
which constitutes an important advance in brine
freezing methods.
When mackerel, alewives and herring arc re-
packed, the original pickle or brine is usually dis-
carded. When salt was cheap it hardly seemed
worth while to attempt to purify this brine or re-
cover the salt, but, during the World War, when
salt was very scarce, several investigations were
undertaken. The most successful of these utilized
the absorptive properties of silica precipitated in
the brine. After filtration the purified brine was
saturated with salt and again used on the repacked
fish. This process has several advantages, viz., low
cost, simplicity; much protein is recovered which
may be converted either into animal food or fer-
tilizer, etc. Unfortunately, few packers of salt fish
care to try anything new or will devise suitable
mechanical equipment for the necessary operations.
Any firm willing to employ an expert chemical en-
gineer for a few months ought to be able to perfect
the mechanical and chemical details of the process
and thus reduce its salt requirements for repacking
fish to practically nothing.
Perhaps no single problem of the fish salting in-
dustry has received so much attention as the red-
dening of salted, dried fish. Hard dried fish are not
affected by this pest to any considerable extent, but
in recent years the American consumer has been
demanding better and better cod. The slightly
dried, boneless "steaks" which are particularly sus-
ceptible to this bacterial growth have become very
popular. Mixtures of boric acid and salt, and so-
dium benzoate and salt have been almost univers-
ally used to check this pest. These antiseptics are
of much value in retarding the growth of the red-
dening organisms, but in spite of their general use
many thousands of dollars' worth of salted ground-
fish are lost each vear.

Bechwith, Bitting, Brown, Edington, Farlow, and
others have isolated the organisms which cause the
trouble, and have shown that they are present in
practically all sea-salt and salt marshes, and that
they grow on the walls and floors of most fish-salt-
ing factories. Many remedies have been suggested
that would doubtless help the situation. Mined
and refined salts are free from the infection and
therefore their substitution for solar sea salts should
lessen the loss. The sea salts which are now so
much in favor among fish salters could be sterilized
by heating. But all are agreed that such measures
will, not be of value unless certain sanitary measures
are simultaneously adopted. The fish salting plants
must be thoroughly disinfected, and kept free from
the infection at all times. The use of concrete floors
and walls in the fish salting establishments will fa-
cilitate these sanitary measures.
A problem of an entirely different nature but of
equal or greater importance is the prevention of
the rusting of salted, smoked, and frozen fish. The
quantity of salted mackerel which is lost because of
the rusting of the fat has been variously estimated
at between 10 and 25 per cent, of the entire pack.
When one considers that the wholesale value of the
mackerel salted annually in the United States alone
is over a million dollars, it is not difficult to realize
that this represents a very great loss to the Amer-
ican fishermen. Herring and alewives are even
more difficult to keep than mackerel, and the losses
are usually greater. Even fish containing but little
fat, such as the cod and haddock, gradually turn
yellow and harden. This yellowing is a sign of
approaching rancidity because of changes in the
fat similar to those causing rust. The writer* has
pointed out that fish free from blood, salted with
pure salt (free from calcium and magnesium salts)
can be stored for much longer periods without rust-
ing than fish salted by the usual commercial pro-
cesses. This aids in the solution of the problem
and indicates the probable cause of the trouble.
Evidently certain enzymes contained in the blood
hasten the chemical changes in the fat which be-
come noticeable when the fish "rusts." Moreover
it must be concluded that the impurities in the salt
also accelerate rusting. Oxygen is required for the
development of rancidity. The storage of fish in
such a way as to prevent the access of air would
solve the problem.
Frozen fatty fish rust much more slowly than
salted fish, yet if they arc kept for long periods,
especially if the temperature is allowed to rise, they
rust badly. The solution of this problem is rela-
tively simple. By merely lowering the temperature
of the cold storage room and holding it constant,
the danger of rusting is eliminated.
•Fishing Gazette 37, No. 8 (1920). 10-11.
The prevention of the rusting of smoked fatty
fish seems very difficult unless they are stored in air
tight containers. A thorough chemical and bac-
teriological investigation of the whole problem
should be made; doubtless the quantity of fish
saved in a single year would more than pay for the
entire research.
The scientific study of fish salting processes has
indicated many improvements in the methods and
quality of the products. No scientific studies of
the changes taking place during the brining and
smoking of fish have been made. Such researches
would enable a more accurate control of the pro-
cess and should point out means of improving the
product. Radcliffe, f in considering various prob-
lems of the fisheries, says:
The practice of preserving fish by smoking is
very ancient and the products properly prepared
may be numbered among the tastiest of foods.
Yet how little attention has been given to the fin-
esse of their preparation by trained technologists,
how much of that offered for sale is only mediocre
in quality. The varying composition of smoke
from different fuels and at different temperatures,
the penetration of the smoke, the subsequent frac-
tional evaporation of the deposited smoke con-
stituents from the fish, the possible addition of
flavoring oils to the fuel, the coloring of the prod-
uct, the prevention of mold on the smoked fish,
possibilities of other improvements in keeping
qualities, and in technique of preparation, all
should be given careful study.
Various workers have recently developed new
methods of dehydrating lean fish. The products
seems excellent and promise to replace much of
the dried salted fish on the market. The methods
have received little commercial recognition as yet.
Much advertising will have to be done in order
to familiarize the public with the products. The
perfection of the proper equipment for fish dehydra-
tion on a large scale is an interesting engineering
problem.
The fat in dehydrated fish, stored under ordinary
conditions, becomes rancid quickly. Dehydrated
fatty fish therefore cannot be stored for any con-
siderable length of time. If fatty fish are to be de-
hydrated commercially, some one must discover an
inexpensive way of storing the product satisfacto-
rily.
Many difficult problems still stand in the way of
the fish canner. However, this industry is particu-
larly fortunate in having a number of excellent re-
search chemists working towards the solution of
the problems. A number of fish and fishery prod-
ucts such as the grayfish, develop ammonia in the
can which attacks the tin and thus discolors the

product. In the case of the grayfish the trouble is
caused by the high content of urea. As yet no
one has suggested an easy solution to this problem.
Sardines are fried by passing through cottonseed
oil heated at 100 to 115 degrees C. by immersed
steam coils. Continued use of this oil causes it
to become viscous, almost black in color, and to
acquire a disagreeable taste and odor. The con-
tinual renewal of the oil is a source of great expense
to the packers. Many attempts have been made
to purify the offensive oil but these have met with
little success. Beard has recently conducted an
investigation of the changes taking place in the oil
during use and has concluded that the presence of
varying quantities of fish oil, and the action of air
and heat are largely responsible for the changes
which take place. Beard has suggested the use of
corn oil and hydrogenated cottonseed oil in addition
to cottonseed oil as a possible remedy.
In recent years many new fishery products have
been canned. Mackerel, river herring, river herring
roe and milt, many novel cod products, etc., were
canned for the first time on a large scale during the
World War when the demand for meat substitutes
was great. The expansion in this field has only
begun. Many other canned fish are equal in quality
to salmon and tuna, and there is no reason why
they should not be canned in large quantities.
Canned marinated products would doubtless be-
come popular with the public if a suitable adver-
tising campaign were undertaken.
During the recent period of high prices of lin-
seed and other common paint and varnish oils,
much fish oil was refined and used as a substitute
for these better known oils. Many of the paints and
varnishes prepared with these substitute fish oils
(menhaden, salmon, albacore, etc.) were found to
be of equal or better quality than the original prod-
uct. One well known fishery concern has placed a
complete line of paints and stains on the market
which are prepared from fish oils that they manu-
facture. Excellent methods of decolorization and
deodorization are being used. Unfortunately these
methods are either secret or patented and are not
available to other manufacturers of fish oils. Much
fish oil is hydrogenated or hardened and manufac-
tured into soaps, and in Europe these hardened oils
have been used as lard substitutes. Until recently
there was no well-established market for fish oils
other than menhaden, salmon, herring and cod liver
oil. Now the value of sardine and albacore oils
are being recognized. The properties of ycllowtail
fish oil have recently been studied by Gardner and
Reilly. This oil was found to be excellent for the
manufacture of paints. The properties of many
other fish oils should be studied. Doubtless, if
their properties were well known, a market would
be found for them. The possibilities of fish oils
are almost unlimited. Scientific research will dis-
cover uses so valuable that we will wonder why
they were ever so cheap.
Shark liver oils have scarcely been investigated
at all. In India and a few other countries they
are used as medicinal oils. But no one has com-
pared them with cod liver oil. A study of their
therapeutic properties should be made with espe-
cial reference to their vitamin A content. Tsuji-
tnoto and other Japanese oil chemists have carried
out detailed researches concerning the chemical
composition of the liver oils of many sharks caught
in Japanese waters. These studies have indicated
many uses for shark liver oils that had scarcely
been suspected. A new hydrocarbon, squalene, was
discovered to be a component of many shark liver
oils; this substance possesses unusual properties.
Similar studies of the liver oils of sharks caught in
American waters should be conducted.
Means of obtaining concentrates of the vitamins
and iodine compounds of cod liver oil such as the
trade product "graduol" should be developed. The
taking of a small dose of such a concentrate elim-
inates the necessity of taking large quantities of
a medicine distasteful to many.
Another problem of the greatest commercial im-
portance that has never been entirely solved is the
construction of an apparatus by which small quan-
tities of fish waste can economically be converted
into animal feed, fertilizer and oil. Professor John
N. Cobb has estimated that fully one-fourth of the
total weight of each salmon handled at the various
packing plants on the Pacific Coast is thrown away.
This means that about 100,000 tons of material
which might be used for the manufacture of oil,
feed, glue, and fertilizer is wasted annually in that
region alone. A ton of salmon waste yields about
27 gallons of salmon oil, suitable for the manufac-
ture of paints and varnishes and for other uses,
and approximately 500 pounds of stock feed or
fertilizer. It has been estimated that this salmon
waste, which is lost each year, would yield from
2 to 5 million dollars' worth of by-products if prop-
erly utilized. Much of the waste is thrown into
the harbor or river beneath the packing factory,
where it putrifies and creates a public nuisance.
Not only would there be a great saving, but the
public health would be benefited materially. There
is also a very large waste of fish other than salmon,
which are taken in the same nets and traps. These
arc thrown overboard and practically all of them
are killed and lost. In order to be used in the
smaller canneries, the fertilizer equipment should
not cost more than $2,500 to $3,000 and should be
simple to operate. A portable plant, which could

Research—The Mother Of Industry
By Arthuh D. Little
WE are living in an age in which new impres-
sions so crowd upon us that the miracle of
yesterday becomes the commonplace of today. We
fail to appreciate how rapidlv our environment is
changing, or how profoundly it has changed. In
spite of the premature grayness of my residuary
hair, you will, I am sure, be polite enough to agree
that I am still a young man. I am, in fact, in the
position of the little girl, who was asked how old
she was. She said, "If you asks me how old I is,
I'se five, but if you ask me how much fun I'se had,
I'se most a hundred." When I review the indus-
trial developments that have taken place within my
recollection, I feel like the grandfather of Methuse-
lah.
In "Mis' Nelly of New Orleans" Mrs. Fiske says,
"I hate old friends, they always refer to 'that de-
lightful Friday afternoon at the Centennial.'" You
will forgive me for recalling that at the Centennial
I saw, as a small boy, the first telephone and the
first commercial arc light. I may also record that
for ten successive days I ate ice cream. In 1884 I
was trying to make 10 tons of sulphite pulp in the
first mill on the continent. Today we make 7000
tons. When I opened a laboratory in Boston the
street cars were drawn by horses, and I remember
the clang of the first electric cars on Boston streets
and the consternation they caused among their
equine competitors. From my window on Beacon
Street two thousand bicycles an hour could be
counted, where now more automobiles pass. I have
seen the fish-tail burner supplanted by the Welsbach
mantle and the incandescent electric lamp develop
from carbon to tungsten filaments through to the
white light of argon-filled bulbs. I remember the
thrill with which I first saw an aeroplane sweep at
dusk across the disc of the rising full moon and soar
to invisibility above. Since then men have crossed
the Atlantic in a single day and flown a mile in 13
seconds. Within a month the Shenandoah, filled
with helium, has sailed majestically over the basin,
which faces my office window. That evening the
Boston "Transcript" printed a description of the
flight sent to its office by wireless from an aeroplane
above the airship. I went with the crowd to hear
Barnum's talking machine, cumbersome as a church
organ, make guttural noises that bore an imagined
resemblance to human speech, and later, in the Old
South Church, heard Edison's phonograph, no big-
ger than a typewriter, reproduce a cornet solo by
the passage of a needle over tin foil. Where the
zoetrope excited the wonder of the children of my
generation, the moving picture now bores thous-
ands and entertains tens of millions. I still preserve
the quill pen, with which I often saw my grand-
father write, and during my own first years in busi-
ness all our letters were written in longhand and
copied in a press.
I well remember the incredulity which the an-
nouncement of the X-rays excited in some lay
quarters, and the-whole marvelous story of radium,
which has led to altogether new conceptions of the
structure of matter, is, of course, a tale of yesterday.
It seems but a few short years since Herz an-
nounced the discovery of long ethereal waves, which
would be refracted and focussed by great prisms
and lenses of pitch; yet during those years there
has developed the whole wonderful system of wire-
less telegraphy and radio-telephony.
When I began the study of chemistry we were
taught that there were certain permanent gases.
They were called permanent because they could not
be liquefied, but, almost before I had learned the
lesson. 1'ictet and Cailletet had liquefied oxygen.
There are now no permanent gases, and liquid air
has become a commonplace of the laboratory and
the raw material for great industries.
I was also taught that atmospheric air contained
onlv oxygen, nitrogen, aqueous vapor, and a small
proportion of carbon dioxide. As even Mr. Bryan
would admit that the human race has been immersed
in air for at least six thousand years and might rea-
sonably be assumed to know all there was to know-
about it, I accepted the instruction at its face value.
Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay were less
credulous and by the most brilliant, patient, and
refined research demonstrated the existence in the
air we breathe of five hitherto unknown gases: ar-
gon, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon. Even their
names carry interest and suggestion. Argon, the
lazy one, because it forms no compounds; helium.
because the spectroscope had revealed its existence
in the sun before its discovery on earth; neon, the
new one; krypton, the hidden one; and xenon, the
stranger. But already the lazy one has been put to
work in incandescent lamp bulbs; helium, with
nearly the lifting power of hydrogen and non-in-
flammable, has become the key to the safer naviga-
tion of the air by dirigibles; while neon tubes flash
advertisements in shop windows and assist chauf-
feurs to locate engine troubles.

A Million Volts
By Richard N. Old*, '2:iE
IX 1918 the Westinghouse Electric and Manufac-
turing Company began the study and design of
the first million volt transformer. At this time the
company had two transformers of 500,000 volts
each, which could be connected in cascade, that is
the transformers are connected in series with one
side grounded. This made available for testing pur-
poses a maximum of 1,000,000 volts. After two
years of investigation the construction of the first
million volt transformer was started. In the latter
part of 1921 it was completed and after preliminary
tests in the works at East Pittsburgh it was shipped
to Xorth TrarYord to be installed in the Westing-
house High Voltage Laboratory. This transformer
was rated at 1000 kv-a., o0 cycles, 1,000,000 volts
above ground. After a very thorough test it was
found that the insulation was not sufficient to with-
stand the enormous stresses which existed in the
transformer. Immediately it was decided to build
a new transformer with better insulation at the
places where the first had failed. In spite of the fact
that it was considered defective, shortly before it

was dismantled the original million volt transformer
generated a voltage of 1,2(X),(XX). This voltage man-
ifested itself by jumping a gap of 74 inches.
The new transformer was built and placed in ser-
vice in November, 1922. This million volt trans-
former has met all of the expectations of its de-
signers and is still functioning at North Trafford.
It also is rated at 1,000 kv-a., 60 cycles. 1,000,000

illustration will give some impression of its great
size.

An unusual amount of care was used in building
this transformer to provide ample creepage surface
between all points of high potential difference. To
protect the transformer from the effects of surges
which very frequently occur in test work, the last
lew outer coils were heavily insulated between ad-
jacent turns. It had been found that on a surge
these turns tended to absorb the energy with the
result that the high voltage induced punctured the
insulation, causing a breakdown between turns.
These last turns on the new transformer were of
:'g inch copper with }/% of an inch of treated cloth
between them. The inside of the tank was lined
with a fullerboard barrier to help the oil insulate
the tank from the high voltage.
A problem which might appear to be difficult was
that of providing a suitable means of bringing the
one million volt lead out of the tank. This problem
was solved very successfully by using the condenser
bushing, which is the best known bushing for high
voltages. Previous to the use of the condenser bush-
ing it was necessary to place the transformer in a
large tank of oil without a cover. The lead is
brought up through a bushing emerging from the
surface of the oil. By this method, however, the oil
is. exposed to both dust and moisture, making it
necessary to filter the oil very frequently to keep it
of the proper insulating strength. Approximately
.002 of 1 per cent of water or dust will make the
oil unfit for use. With a metal cover on the top to

keep the dust and moisture out of the tank, it was
necessary to provide a bushing which would stand
up under the million volt stress. The condenser
bushing is built up of layers of tinfoil separated by
paper and utilizes the series-condenser principle of
potential gradient equalization. Thus in this bush-
ing every part is subjected to the same electrostatic
stress, whereas, in the older types of bushing the in-
ner material was stressed very highly and the outer
section was under very little stress. The bushing
used on the million volt transformer was designed
to stand 2,000,(XX) volts, and table II will give an
idea of the size and weight of this bushing. It is
the largest bushing of the condenser type that has
been built.

To distribute the dielectric stresses evenly over
the top, no bolt heads or other projections were
allowed above the plane of the cover. It was also
found that by placing a static shield on top of the
bushing the corona discharge at this point was en-
tirely eliminated. This torus shaped shield was

THE HIGHEST VOLTAGE TRANSFORMER EVER BUILT
covered with lead foil, giving a greater area over
which the electrostatic stress would distribute itself
and so eliminate corona.
The tube between the shield and the lower sphere
of the gap is wound with heavy wire to make it of
very high inductance and to give it support against
high frequency surges. Connected to this surge sup-
pressor are the sphere gaps. These spheres are 100
cm in diameter and required an unusual amount of
care during the machining process. The spheres
were first machined to approximately the correct
diameter. It was found after several days that the
spheres had lost their spherical shape. This was
due to the internal stresses in the brass manifesting
their presence. Because of these stresses it was nec-
essary to machine the spheres three times before
they would hold their perfect shape.
By the use of an induction motor the upper sphere
can be raised or lowered according to the maximum
voltage desired for the particular test. The lower
sphere is stationary. In series to ground with the
upper sphere is a high resistance, made of carbons,
which is used to limit the current after the arc is
formed across the gap.
In the operation of the transformer safety is the
first consideration and efficiency a secondary mat-
ter. Safety first, last and all the time must be ob-
served by everyone in a high voltage laboratory
because of the distances which are jumped by the
high potentials used. On closing the primary cir-
cuit of the transformer an automobile horn is
sounded automatically; also the lamp above the
control panel on the floor is turned out. At thL-
signal all the men who are working on the floor
report to the office to learn the location of the dan-
ger zones.
Tower to excite the primary winding is supplied
either directly from the Duqucsne Light &amp; Power
Company's distributing lines or from the same
source through an induction motor generator set.
In either case, the circuit is completed through an
induction regulator which varies the voltage from
zero to 5,000 volts. The motor generator set is used
when it is necessary to have a more accurate con-
trol over the voltage. This method keeps any surges
on the main system from showing up in the secon-
dary voltage and flashing over the sphere gap at
an unknown voltage.
The control equipment on this transformer is a
most remarkable application of remote control, for
the complete transformer equipment with switches,
motors and generators is directly under the control
of a single operator stationed in a booth overlooking
the laboratory.
The measurement of these high voltages has been
a difficult problem. A considerable amount of re-
search has been and is being done to determine


Page 21

methods and to check the accuracy of these meth-
ods. In 1913, The American Institute of Electrical
Engineers adopted the sphere spark gap as the
standard after pioneer work had been done on this
method by Farnsworth and Fortescue of the West-
inghouse Company. As secondary methods of
measuring voltage, several systems have been tried,
chief among these being the crest voltmeter meth-

FLA.SHING OVER A POST OF INSULATORS WITH 700,000
VOLTS. THE CORONA ON THE LEAD-IN WIRE
IS PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE
od as advocated by the Westinghouse Company.
Another method is to use a specially designed coil
which is built into the transformer and compen-
sated for errors. The latter method is practically
self-evident, whereas the former will perhaps need
some explanation. The crest voltmeter method was
developed by E. W." Chubb of the Westinghouse
Company, who found both mathematically and ex-
perimentally that the average value of the charg-
ing current of an electrostatic condenser is propor-
tional to the peak value of the applied voltage wave.
The condenser bushing is a very good electrostatic
condenser, and when used with a crest voltmeter it
is necessary to insulate it from the tank with a cork
or felt washer. The charging current having a fre-
quency of 60 cycles is rectified so that a very sensi-
tive direct current ammeter might be used to mea-
sure the voltages. As shown by figure 1, both bulb
and mechanical rectifiers are used. Considerable
inaccuracy was found in the bulb system. At pres-
ent Westinghouse research engineers are working
on a new system of connections which it is hoped
will solve the problem. The mechanical method
of rectification or commutator rectifier calls for the
use of a three-phase, four-pole, 54 h. p- synchronous
motor connected to the same supply circuit as the
million volt transformer. On the end of its shaft
is a commutator of special construction, as shown
in the sketch, to which the charging current of the
condenser bushing is brought with two brushes
and from which the rectified current is taken by
two brushes. The meters being very sensitive it
is necessary for them to be shunted with several
resistances in parallel to give better readings on the
meter scale for various high voltages.
An electrostatic voltmeter in series with a con-
denser has been used recently to give indications
of the voltage on the transformer. The electro-
static voltmeter is very simple in construction, as
shown in the picture, and works on the principle
that like charges repel each other. The moving
and stationary vanes of the meter are connected
at the top and bottom. The condenser is made by
placing a metal disc over several six-inch post-type
insulators on the top of the transformer tank. The
meter is connected to the metal disc. On the
moving vane is a small mirror on which a beam
of light is thrown. As the voltage on the con-
denser builds up, this beam of light is reflected on
a scale several feet in front of the mirror. The
scale is calibrated with the sphere gap. This
method is merely in its experimental stage.
At the present time much effort and money are
being spent in the study of high voltage phenomena.
This has been brought about because of the pos-
sibility in the very near future of using voltages for
transmission of 330,000 volts and even up to
440,000 volts.

"Research—A Mental Attitude"
By Charles F. Kettering
President General Motors Research Corporation
WHAT is research? Since the war, I think our
industries in America have thought more in
terms of research than ever before, but our indus-
trialists are very far from appreciating fully the
possibilities of research in any line.
I think anybody who has had anything to do
with research finds that there is no trouble in tak-
ing almost any industry and finding that there arc-
great possibilities of improvement. However, it
would be most difficult to convince the workers or
people in that industry that this is the case. I have
written it down as an axiom that the technical end
of any industry will accept anything new if it is
just like what they had before, and research work-
ers sometimes make the mistake of wrapping the
package in red paper instead of brown paper which
everyone is accustomed to.
It is perfectly astounding the number of things
we do in industry for absolutely no reason what-
ever. Take for example, the buttons on our dress
coats sleeves. There are three on mine, and I am
quite sure there is no particular reason why there
should be three. But because somebody put them
there once, they keep on doing it that way, and we
are going to keep right on putting them there until
someone has the intelligence or interest to find a
scientific analysis.
Take, for instance, in electro-chemistry. What
we term today as positive and negative are wrong;
their being called positive and negative was purely
through accident. If the fellow had picked up a
piece of silk first instead of a cat skin first, it would
have been the other way around. He stroked a
glass or ebony rod with a cat skin and said it was
negative, and it is now going to remain that wav-
even though we know it goes just the other way
around.
What is research for? It is either to reduce cost,
increase utility, have a greater sales appeal, extend
business, or to obtain needed data. The proper men-
tal attitude is "How can I find out what is wrong
with the thing I am doing, or how can I improve
it?" Difficult) is always met with in seeking co-
operation from the workers in that particular field,
as they argue that it has always been done that
way and it is, in fact, the only possible way to do it.
It is necessary to solve the problem in many in-
stances yourself, without the aid of so-called ex-
perts. Take for example, the making of fan-belts for
automobiles. At one time we received numerous
complaints as to the wearing qualities of the belts
we were putting in our cars. We devised a machine
for testing such belts, and in this machine the type
of belt we were using stood up about 7 hours. We
appealed to the belt manufacturers to give us a belt
which would stand up five to six times this length
of time, and they replied that "A belt is a belt."
They had always made the belts a particular way
and they were positively the best belts you could
get. We tried it ourselves and not knowing any-
thing about belt manufacture our first attempt pro-
duced a belt that stood about 20 hours. We called in
the belt manufacturers and showed them what we
produced, and they said, "Well, if you are going to
do it that way. why, of course, you can get such a
result." We were not satisfied with this first at-
tempt, and started out in diametrically the opposite
direction and produced a belt that lasted 60 hours.
We again called in the manufacturers and their
reply was the same as in the first instance. We are
are now producing belts regularly that last over 120
hours in the machine and are good for the life of the
automobile.
Tt was the same way with the paint manufactur-
ers. Previously it took about 37 days to properly
paint an automobile, and about the same length of
time to wear the paint off. We wanted to secure a
quick-drying paint so we could increase production.
We called in the paint manufacturers and asked
them to give us a paint that would dry in a few
hours. One or two of the bolder representatives
were not very polite in their opinions as to our de-
mands. They thought they might reduce the time
of drying by one day, if they did a lot of work.
Here again we were forced to try ourselves. Un-
applied the paint by use of a spray gun. Our first
attempt was so successful that the paint dried in
mid-air between the gun and the automobile body.
Our work was, therefore, to produce a paint that
would take a reasonable length of time to dry and
still require very much less time than was previous-
ly required in regular practice; and at the same
time, have a durability that is very much greater
than the most durable varnish.
Another difficulty which the research worker
must contend with, is that we are often told when
a specific line of investigation is proposed, that it
has been tried before and didn't work. I suggest
to these people they take a base ball bat and trv

Motor Fuel And Petroleum Work In The
Department Of Chemical Engineering
By Prof. E. H. Leslie
THE manufacture of petroleum products is now
the second largest industry in the United States,
exceeded in value of products only by meat pack-
ing. P'or this reason, and also because of the
fundamental importance of gasoline and lubricating
oils to the motor industry centered in Detroit, it is
both important and appropriate that facilities for
the special study of the manufacture and utiliza-
tion of motor fuels and other petroleum products
should be available at Michigan.
At present, gasoline is king. The refiner of pe-
troleum now regards lubricating oils, kerosene,
waxes and fuel oils as by-products. Such large
corporations as the Standard Oil Company (Ind-
iana) are successful in making 65 to 70 barrels of
gasoline from every 100 barrels of crude petroleum
that enters their plant. The industry as a whole
does less than half as well as this. The difference
is the result of many factors, but among these,
management that keenly appreciates the value of
scientific and engineering brains in plant opera-
tion and process development is the chief one. The
Standard Oil companies use technical brains. A
large number of companies do not. And the story
is told in the balance sheet.
The technology of the petroleum industry is now
in process of rapid change. Development is mainly
along two lines: cracking, and improved fractiona-
tion.
The old line method of refining petroleum con-
sisted in heating the oil in a still and condensing
the vapors to produce several fractions. The most
volatile of these was called gasoline, and the others,
in order of their volatility, kerosene, gas-oil, and
lubricating distillates. Depending on the nature
of the crude oil, the residue left in the still was
a cylinder stock or an asphaltic fuel oil.
Many refiners still use this general scheme and
by so doing obtain 20% of gasoline. By improved
methods of fractionation it is possible to increase
the yield of gasoline 10 to 50%. Yet refiners are
slow to take advantage of procedures well known
in other industries. Herein lies a real opportunity
for the engineer who knows the ins and outs of
fractional distillation, and who, in addition, has
the ability to sell his knowledge and services.
From the engineers' standpoint there is one great
dissatisfaction in building distillation equipment.
The design of this apparatus is almost wholly em-
pirical. Fractional distillation is one of the funda-
mental operations that falls within the field of the
Chemical Engineer. To the end of correlating
theory and practice and making rational design pos-
sible, we have started a program of investigation
of the phenomena involved and of the perform-
ance of typical equipment. The first fruits of this
work have taken form in the Doctorate dissertation
of Mr. John C. Geniesse.
The basis of the present theory of distillation
lies in a specialized field of thermodynamics and
physics, namely, knowledge of the so-called "equi-
librium-diagram" of the system of liquids to be dis-
tilled. The engineer, all too frequently, does not
shoulder his share of the responsibility for the ad-
vancement of the scientific fundamentals on which
his superstructure of application and actual doing

is based. For some reason he seems to feel that a
beneficent science will provide. And when, in a
streak of thoroughness, he investigates the scien-
tific literature and discovers that the information
desired is not to he found, he blames his scientific
brother for being so thoughtless as to have over-
looked this important matter.
The fact is that scientific information on any
particular subject, except on a few of those that
are the main scientific issues of the day, is frag-
mentary. This is natural enough, for the process
of producing this information is haphazard. Or-
ganizations such as our own National Research
Council are doing an excellent work in organizing
and correlating the endeavor of scientific workers.
The distillation engineer is engulfed in the gen-
eral situation I have just mentioned. His particular
need is a knowledge of equilibrium diagrams, for
these are the basis of all his work. Realizing this,
we have been studying this general problem from
the vapor pressure standpoint, and the first mile-
stone in this work is the Doctorate dissertation of
Mr. Arthur R. Carr, describing a rapid and precise
method of calculating these diagrams from limited
vapor pressure data. Mr. Carr's work will be of
real value scientifically as well as practically.
The second field of oil refinery work in which
interest is keen and progress most rapid is "crack-
ing." By "cracking" is meant a process of thermal
decomposition by means of which the heavier oils
such as gas oils, fuel oils, and asphaltic residuums
are converted in part into the more valuable gaso-
line. The present-day supply of gasoline would be
wholly inadequate were it not for the use of crack-
ing processes by the more progressive oil refiners.
The average crude oil contains 20-22% of gasoline.
But the yield from all the oil refined in this country
is 28-30%. This larger yield is mainly the result
of applying cracking processes. And the results
obtained by such companies as the Standard Oil
Co. (Indiana) who obtain 60-70% gasoline, are only
possible by the intensive application of cracking.
The Standard Oil Companies have well over $100,-
000,000 invested in Burton process equipment alone.
By way of side-light may I suggest that crack-
ing is the handwriting on the wall for fuel-oil.
Engineers have been prone to advocate the broader
use of fuel oils. As a temporary expedient this is
justifiable, but as a broad future policy it is a serious
error. Coal we have in plenty. Oil is a natural
resource of definite limitations. The inexorable
working of economic law will result in the use
of such oil as is available for preferential purposes.
Gasoline is now, and from present indications will
be in the future, in much keener demand than fuel
oil. Relative prices tell the story, and the spread
in price between gasoline and fuel oil will increase
as the years pass. The result will be a conversion
of fuel oil into gasoline, and consequently a short-
age of fuel oil for industrial purposes.
The commercial importance of cracking, and the
fact that the operation is one so definitely in the
province of chemical engineering, has led us to
start several lines of investigation bearing on this
general problem. These are yet in progress, but
we hope that definite and valuable contributions to
the all too limited knowledge of the fundamentals
on which cracking processes are based, as well as
to the actual practice of cracking, will be made.
The importance of the motor industry to the
people of the state of Michigan renders it impera-
tive that the University should contribute in some
measure to the knowledge of motor fuel utilization
as well as to that of motor fuel production. The
automobile is changing the life of the entire nation.
It is probably the greatest factor at work in this

direction, as other great inventions that resulted
in revolutionizing transportation and ease of com-
munication have been in days gone by.
An adequate motor fuel supply is essential to the
widespread use of the automobile. Rut the prob-
lem is not alone one of production. If a car is
so improved as to run twice as far on a gallon of
gasoline this is equivalent to increasing the motor
fuel supply one hundred per cent. The importance
of studying the utilization of fuels is evident.
A comprehensive review of the scientific and en-
gineering literature reveals many conflicting data
and much difference of opinion on the combustion of
fuels in explosion engines. Some who have spoken
the loudest are apparently widest of the mark of
true explanation of the complex and fascinating
phenomena involved.
In order intelligently to study the problem of
motor fuel combustion we deemed it essential to
start with a fuel of known chemical composition.
To this end a paraffin-base naphtha was carefully
fractionated to produce the individual hydrocarbons.
Hexane was chosen as a suitable fuel. A bomb
fitted with a special pressure element and an op-
tical system that allowed photographic recording
of the pressure-time curve was constructed. Using
this apparatus Mr. George G. Brown has secured
results of unusual interest and importance, and
which permit an intelligent qualitative interpreta-
tion of the combustion processes, including the puz-
zling fuel-knock about which so much has been
said and so little really known. These results are
presented in the thesis submitted by Mr. Brown
in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the
Doctor's degree.
Work on fuel production and utilization will be
continued. The lines of investigation I have men-
tioned are the major ones, but several others of
more restricted interest and importance have been
or are being followed.

to hit three straight balls, pitched by even the
average league pitcher directly over the base. They
would come back with the report saying they had
tried it, and it was impossible to hit the ball. After
they wrote a report of several volumes, I would
then take Babe Ruth and let him take one swing
at the ball, and what would the report amount to?
Our engineering research today is often super-
ficial and does not go into fundamentals. When we
finally solve a problem we say that it is a simple
solution, and everybody recognizes that it is the
only thing that would have worked in the first
place. However, it would not be research unless
we tried everything on earth first but the right
thing. Our motto is, "This Problem When Solved
Will Be Simple." I do not believe anybody is justi-
fied in tackling any research problem unless he can
analyze it first into a probable case; that is, if cer-
tain things can be changed; if certain factors can
be moved, then certain results can be accomplished.
Before undertaking the work he must be able to
say, "I must move this particular thing."
A successful research laboratory should have a
commercial idea about what they are doing from a
dollars-and-cents viewpoint, and have an appreci-
ation of what constitutes an industrial problem.
Otherwise they may jump forty-five years ahead
with something no one understands and leave the
intervening territory unexplored. Executives of
these industries would then say they do not believe
in research.
We must certainly look down the road toward
the ultimate improvement and increased utility of
our products but we must not lose sight of the type
of research which helps any specific industry solve
its problems in such a way that it reflects to the
advantage of its bank account.
ASTEROIDS
(Continued from prige S&gt;
a gap about 2200 miles in width, is just so located
relative to the nearest satellite, Mimias, that the
path of a satellite in the gap would be of type 2/1
relative to it.
Our study of the characteristic planets began in
an attempt to consider the type 3/2. This investiga-
tion has been expanded to include as much as pos-
sible of the whole problem but with particular at-
tention to the types 2/1, 3/2 and 4/3. The amount
of labor involved can only be appreciated by those
who have undertaken such problems. Referring to
a work of equal magnitude in a somewhat similar
problem, Sir George Darwin remarked: "The slow-
ness with which results are obtained by arithme-
tical processes has been very tantalizing, but the
interest of the work has been sustained by the fact
that the results have presented a succession of sur-
prises." Thus we have been led on and on, grad-
ual!y seeing evolve a more complete knowledge of
the motion of characteristic planets than had been
known before. A large share of the computation
has been done by student assistants whose growing
enthusiasm has been an inspiration.
The investigation of type 2/1 is now comprehen-
sive and as complete as the practicability of the
problem justifies. The important properties of type
3/2 have been in our hands for some time. The
type 4/3 involves much greater labor than the others
and, therefore, greater patience and more persistent
faith. But these computations have already demon-
strated the common properties of the characteristic

types, and it only remains to be seen how far the
work can be carried practically.
Now, as to the method, we use a process combin-
ing that employed by Darwin (referred to above)
and by Poincare in his remarkable contribution to
the problem of three bodies. Professor Moulton of
the University of Chicago has developed and sup-
plied the theoretical basis upon which the method
stands and has used it most effectively in his studies
of Periodic Orbits. Perhaps the following explana-
tion will suffice here:
The orbit of a planet about the Sun, undisturbed
by other bodies, is an ellipse with the Sun at a
focus. It.s -period depends upon the length of its
semi-major axis and is independent of the eccentri-
city of the ellipse. If the mass of the planet whose
motion is under investigation is neglected, its type
w =n+1 and the semi-major axis a of its orbit
are related to the mass s of the Sun by the equa-
tion— a3w2=S.
It is not difficult to lay out all possible motions of
an undisturbed planet moving in ellipses of various
eccentricities but of common focus with collinear
and equal major axes a and, therefore, possessing
equal periods. Certain of these ellipses will pass
through the position of Jupiter and others near to
or eject from the Sun. These place limits upon the
investigation which narrow the belts for study. The
problem, then, consists in following the disturbance
in the motion of the small planet due to the pres-
ence of Jupiter and in finding the disturbed paths
which re-enter upon themselves after an assigned
number of revolutions. These periodic orbits may,
therefore, be used to follow the planet indefinitely.
Essentially the same concept was utilized by Pro-
fessor Brown in his development of the new Tables
of the Moon.
There seems to be no end to the problems which
grow out of a study of the asteroids. The question
is, rather, to find those which will yield results with
reasonable effort. But, in every case of importance,
Moulton, Darwin. Gylden, Hill and the others who
have given thought to these matters give expres-
sion to an appreciation of the length of time re-
quired to secure results and to the interest and
pleasure involved in the task. From every side, the
asteroids constitute an embarrassing wealth for
scientific research and, from every avenue of ap-
proach, they are a collection of precious gems in the
lure of fascinating study and profound interest.
RESEARCH—MOTHER OF INDUSTRY
(Continued from page I8)
In 1898, Sir William Crookes, having in mind the
inadequacy of the supply of nitrogenous fertilizers
for the agricultural needs of our expanding popula-
.tion, and speaking as president of the British Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science, said, "Eng-
land, and all civilized nations, stand in deadly peril
of not having enough to eat." That peril is now
removed by the effective and spectacular processes,
developed by chemists, for the production of such
fertilizers by the fixation of nitrogen from atmos-
pheric air.
My study of chemistry began with Eliot and
Storer's Manual. Its copius index contains no ref-
erence either to catalysis or colloids. Today catal-
ysis has a copious literature of its own and is rec-
ognized as the determining factor in hundreds of
reactions, on which are based new industrial meth-
ods for; the production of such important and di-
verse materials as edible fats, ammonia, sulphuric
acid, synthetic dyes, and a whole series of hydro-
carbon derivatives. Colloid chemistry has become
no less inclusive. It permeates such industries as
tanning, artificial silk, rubber, smokeless powder,
celluloid, photography, and soap. It solves the
problems of the makers of ceramic wares, shaving
creams, and shoe blacking.
The decade beginning with 1890 was notable for
great industrial development based upon research.
In that year Hall brought out the aluminum pro-
cess; in 1891 Acheson began the manufacture of
carborundum and made available abrasives of a
new order of efficiency; in 1892 Willson established
the basis for the carbide, acetylene, and cyanamid
industries by his process for calcium carbide; in '93
the Diesel engine was invented, Cross and Bevan
communicated to me their discovery of viscos from
which last year one American company made
22,000,000 pounds of artificial silk, and I demon-
strated the Schultz processes for chrome tanning
which have revolutionized the leather industry; in
'94 the automobile was developed; at about this
time I was engaged in the investigation of the new
electrolytric processes of l.e Sueur and others for
the manufacture of bleaching powder and alkali and
was producing, by laboratory methods, cellulose
acetate, the substance by which, during the world
war, the wings of airplanes were protected; in '95
Roentgen announced the X-rays; in '96 Becquerel
discovered radio-activity; in '97 synthetic indigo,
the product of German technical skill and financial
courage, was placed upon the market and estab-
lished still more firmly German control of the dye-
stuff markets of the world; in '97 also Marconi sent
a wireless message across Bristol Channel, while
1898 will be forever memorable for the discovery of
radium.
As business men, you are accustomed to forecast
tendencies by the trend of plotted curves. Let me
assure you that the trend of the research curve is
steeply upward. Research which has paid these
heavy dividends and countless others in one decade,

needs only your recognition and support to enable
it to pay still more heavily in the future. The vein is
constantly widening, and the instruments of re-
search grow steadily more effective. Equally it is
true that the means of reducing research results to
practice are today incomparably better than they
ever were before.
I would apologize for having given to this frag-
mentary and totally inadequate review so personal
a tone were I not anxious to bring home to you the
fact that all these great developments, so far-reach-
ing in their influence upon industry, our mental
outlook, and our entire social structure, have taken
place within the easy recollection of a man still on
the job. Perhaps you recognized and turned to
profit some of the opportunities that these develop-
ments afforded. Whether you did or not, it is worth
your while to bear in mind that another procession
is forming around the corner.
Three fundamental factors are involved in indus-
trv: capital, labor, and the creative mind. The cre-
ative mind may function along the line of organiza-
tion and management, or it may function along the
line of research. In any progressive civilization, in-
dustry is constantly pushing its outposts forward
into the new territory wrested from the unknown
by its advance guard, science. Xow science is mere-
ly information, so classified and organized as to be
used effectively and at once, and information, to
quote General Phil. Sheridan, is "the great essential
of success." Advance information of the result of
the battle of Waterloo consolidated the Rothschild
fortune. It is advance information, which may be
of equal potential value, that research offers you.
Research to-day is extending the boundaries of
every field of human activity and thought. It is to-
day more effectively than ever directing industrial
expansion into new channels and new territories.
We are, for example, about to witness revolutionary
changes in the preparation and use of fuel. Powder-
ed coal has already established itself in engineering
practice. Much progress has been made in low-tem-
perature carbonization with higher recoveries of
chemical values and the production of artificial an-
thracite. The conversion of coal to liquid hydro-
carbons through hydrogenation has been demon-
strated on the commercial scale in Germany, though
the figures on the balance sheet are doubtless still
in red. The gas industry is destined to a great ex-
pansion, which will involve radically new methods.
The industrial use of gas has scarcely begun, yet in
Baltimore, within the last six years, more gas has
been consumed than during the preceding century.
S\ stems for the complete gasification of coal have
been developed, and there are serious proposals for
great gas works at the mines and the distribution
of industrial gas through high-pressure mains.
Steam pressures in central stations have reached
500 pounds, and pressures of 1200 and even 1500
pounds are cautiously being tried. They present
problems in the behavior and strength of steel at
high temperatures in contact with water and gases
that can only be solved by intensive research. The
gas turbine presents other problems, which seem to
be nearing a solution, but here, again, is more re-
search required.
Decades of research have brought us to the point
where we may soon expect oxygen, the supporter
of combustion, to be as cheap by the ton as coal.
That implies an impending revision of blast-furnace
practice and of many operations in general metal-
lurgy. It presents the possibility of the continuous
g;&gt;s producer and should raise the quality and heat-
ing power of industrial gas. It calls for new refrac-
tories.
Petroleum is about to be raised to a new and
higher plane of usefulness and value, where it will
serve as the starting point for the synthesis of whole
series of organic compounds.
Biological chemistry is contributing new fermen-
tation processes, which yield buytl and amyl alco-
hols, acetone, glycerine, and fats and in its alliance
with medicine is conquering some of the most ter-
rible scourges of the human race.
In 1922 Bohr published "The Theory of Spectra
and Atomic Constitution." That, I submit, is seem-
ingly far removed from industry and practical af-
fairs. But Bohr's theory indicated that an unknown
element should exist in zirconium-bearing minerals.
In 1923 Coster and Hevesy, by means of X-ray anal-
ysis, found the element as predicted. It is named
Hafnium, in honor of Bohr's citv, Copenhagen.
That you may better appreciate the potentialities
of this discovery let me add that Hafnium is esti-
mated to represent 1/100,000th of the earth's crust
and to be, therefore, more plentiful than lead, tin,
and many other materials of commerce.
The French chemist, Dumas, writing to Pasteur
concerning Lavoisier, the father of chemistry, said:
"The art of experimentation leads from the first
to the last link of the chain, without hesitation and
without a blank, making successive use of Reason,
which suggests an alternative, and of Experience,
which decides on it. until, starting from a faint
glimmer, the full blaze of light is reached."
Our prosperity in the past has been largely based
on cheap land and superabundant raw materials.
Today our civilization has developed such complex-
ity that we cannot hope to maintain our position
except through the assistance which only science
can afford. The laboratory has become a prime

mover for the machinery of civilization, and the
evidence that has been placed before you justifies
the claim that there is a direct obligation upon in-
dustry to support research with the generosity of an
enlightened self-interest, for Research is the Mother
of Industry.

thousand miles from the Atlantic coast cities. Will
"it be transmitted this distance by wires? Or will
some means of local power generation be devised
on the Atlantic side? How will water power prob-
lems be dealt with in rivers where the annual rise
and fall is over forty feet and which are nearly as
large as the Ohio?
Industries will spring up over night where there
are almost none at present. There are no large in-
dustries there and they cannot be started, much less
maintained, without experienced men who have
special training. Manufacturing on a large scale is
unknown. There are many raw materials and what
labor there is, will be cheap. Timber for building
will be cheap for many decades to come. Someone
will have to train a great army of unskilled labor
and make of it a body of efficient workmen. Meth-
ods of efficiency and production will have to be
worked overtime unless the population can be
made to increase rapidly enough to maintain the
present low scale of labor prices. The industrial
engineer will have an opening here. All these things
will have to be done when development does start,
because then manufacturing and all its problems
will grow apace.
Salesmen and advertisers will have the world for
a playground. It seems as if there were already a
field for someone to give publicity to Amazonia,
Surely this great area would not lie idle any longer
if the progressive portion of the world knew of its
possibilities. The region needs, just now, someone
to display its products in such a way that they may-
be popularized among the peoples of the world.
It has been mentioned that there are great areas
which have never been explored. And those which
have been have, for the most part, not been accur-
ately mapped. Probably not more than a hundredth
part of one per cent of Amazonia has really been
accurately mapped. Some time there will be work
here for thousands of surveyors and civil engineers
merely in making maps, not to mention the detailed
work which always goes with developing a country.
Sanitation is in a pitiful state throughout the
whole of the Amazon country. It is not improbable
that sanitation work similar to that done in Panama
will have to be done over many hundreds of square
miles. This will be, in a great measure, a matter
of education among the people who already live
there. Much work of this sort is to be done in a
country which depends upon vultures to keep the
dead and decaying animal matter removed from its
cities and back yards. Water supplies will have to
be purified and inhabitants taught to dress and live
properly.
The tasks are great and the problems many in
the future development of the region of the Ama-
zon. One wonders just when this country will start
to improve. Will it be within ten years? Or twenty-
five? Or will it take fifty for the progressive races
to see the advantages to be gained from developing
and improving such a potentially wealthy land?
The writer is inclined toward the belief that twenty-
five years will see this movement well started and
rapidly progressing. There is still opportunity for
some of the remaining pioneer blood of our race to
assert itself and seek new worlds to conquer. The
Amazon is a fitting place to become a pioneer and
the tasks to be carried out are worthy of the strong-
est men we can produce. When the Amazon be-
comes the true "Main Street of Brazil" the engineer
will be one of the greatest factors in its growth.
Will the historian of one or two hundred years
hence point out that American Universities turned
out the Engineers who built the civilization of the
Amazon?

Engineering Shop Courses Revised
Those students who are wont to acclaim the
shortcomings of teaching methods in the various
departments of the Engineering college now have
the satisfaction of seeing several adjustments being
made in the Engineering Shops. The purpose of
the revision in this department is to eliminate those
manual exercises which are not absolutely neces-
sary to the illustration of principles of processes
and methods. It is not desired nor even hoped that
the laboratory courses in this department should
make a technician of the student but should be an
instrument whereby the student can convince him-
self of the veracity of the principles taught in the
classroom and from conceptions directly from ob-
servations of exercises devised for that purpose. In
the accomplishment of this plan it has been neces-
sary to replace some of the production machinery
formerly used by up to date apparatus which are
typical with the best practice methods, and various
testing machines to use in the examination and
testing of specimens of heat treated metal and
welds, etc. It is to the better accomplishment of
these aims that some very appropriate and valu-
able gifts have been made to the Engineering
Shops. Very important among these is an Electric
Furnace donated by the Detroit Electric Furnace
Company. This piece of equipment will till a long
felt need of a furnace for experimental and instruc-
tion purposes to be used for temperature ranges
required for melting metals used in machine and
tool construction. It will also facilitate some ex-
periments on melting and alloying aluminum, brass,
copper, cast iron and steel. The furnace has a ca-
pacity of 250 pounds per charge, being exceptional
inasmuch as no other University has a furnace of
this great a capacity. The heat for this furnace is
obtained from a ninety-volt, sixty kilowatt supply.
The installation is now being planned; this item
alone will amount to nearly a thousand dollars.
A Simpson sand mixer for mixing core-sand is
also among the gifts. This was given by the manu-
facturer and has a value of about five hundred dol-
lars. Another addition to the equipment is a new
15.0CO pound planer now being installed that is to
be used for research work in investigating the re-
lation between the work required and variable prop-
erties'of a cutting tool such as geometric form and
speed of cutting. Results obtained from this in-
vestigation will be released for the benefit of the
industries of the state, and especially the automo-
tive world. A special committee of which Mr. Bos-
ton is a member, has been appointed by the Amer-
ican Society of Mechanical Engineers to report on
the results of the experiments. Funds for this re-
search work which is being handled by the depart-
ment of Engineering Research, have been made
available by the Packard Motor Company, The
General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company.
Hupp Motor Car Corporation, Reo Motor Car Com-
pany, Detroit Twist Drill Company and others.
Other machines needed in the Engineering Labor-
atory were purchased. Among these are: several
heat treat furnaces electrically heated, a 1000 Ib.
capacity cupola, a Fellows gear shaper for shaping
spur or helical gears, Gleason gear machine for the
shaping of bevel gears, a Gould and Eberhard hob-
bing machine for spur and bevel gears, and several
new grinders.
With the equipment as planned the new Engin-
eering Laboratories will be a model place to be-
come acquainted with the fundamental ideas of
production of all types, and it is hoped that these
aims so well meant by the heads of the departments
who have spent great effort in their formulation,
will fall nothing short of successful realization.
The Engineers' Ten Commandments
1. The engineer will carry on his professional
work in a spirit of fairness to employees and con-
tractors, fidelity to clients and employers, loyalty
to his country, and devotion to high ideals of cour-
tesy and personal honor.
2. He will refrain from associating himself
with, or allowing the use of his name by an enter-
prise of questionable character.
3. He will advertise only in a dignified manner,
being careful to avoid misleading statements.
4. lie will regard as confidential any informa-
tion obtained bv him as to the business affairs and
technical methcxls or processes of a client or em-
ployer.
5. He will inform a client or employer of any
business connections, interests or affiliations which
might influence his judgment or impair the dis-
interested quality of his services.
o. He will refrain from using any improper
or questionable methods of soliciting professional
work, and will decline pay or to accept commissions
for securing such work.
7. lie will accept compensation, financial or
otherwise, for a particular service from one source
only, except with the full knowledge and consent
of all interested parties.
8. He will not use unfair means to win pro-
fessional advancement or to injure the chances of
another engineer to secure and hold employment.
9. He will co-operate in upbuilding the Engin-
eering Profession by exchanging general informa-
tion and experience with his fellow engineers and
students of engineering, and also by contributing


Page 31
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to the work of engineering societies, schools of ap-
plied sciences, and the technical press.
10. He will interest himself in the public wel-
fare in behalf of which he will be ready to apply
his special knowledge, skill and training for the
use and benefit of mankind.
Colonel Miller's New Book
American Coast Artillery Material
1'repared in the office of the Chief of Ordnance. 513
paues, illustrations, hound in Imckrum. Ordnance Depart-
ment Document No. 20J2. For sale by the Superintendent
of Documents, Washington. Price $1.00.
This work is on the of the finest that has ever ap-
peared on the subject. It is complete, thorough,
and exact. It should prove to be a most valuable
handbook for all those, military and civilian, who
are interested in coast artillery materiel.
Part I of the volume contains a history of the
development of artillery. Part II traces and ex-
plains the many steps connected with the design
and manufacture of great seacoast weapons. Part
III gives a detailed description of American sea-
coast guns and mounts. Part IV is devoted to
tables of miscellaneous data.
Much of the credit for this monumental piece
of ordnance literature is due Col. H. W. Miller,
formerly of the Artillery Division, Office of the
Chief of Ordnance, who is one of the foremost
authorities on seacoast weapons in this country.
His excellent articles on the "German Long Range
Gun'' which appeared in the Army Ordnance Jour-
nal will be recalled by our readers.
We. too, hope, with Colonel Miller, that this
book "will serve the purpose of giving to the early
as well as the advanced student such a comprehen-
sion of the problems of development, design and
manufacture of seacoast artillery, as will enable
him to render more efficient service in any branch
of the Army having to do with any type of artil-
lery." We recommend this volume to everyone
interested in the subject.

The Student Branch of the A. S. C. E.
The student branch of the A. S. C. E. held a meet-
ing on Wednesday, April 9, at the Chinese Gardens,
where talks by Professor Riggs and Professor Cis-
sel. a technical paper by Robert Whitaker and re-
ception of the initiates were the principal events.
Prof. Riggs conversed interestingly on the activities
of the Xational Organization with which the stu-
dent branch of the society is connected. Prof. Cis-
sel discussed some interesting points in regard to
science and world progress, emphasizing the part
of the engineer in this connection. Ripley Sehemm
took the part of tc-astmaster throughout the meet-
ing. William Saunders, president of the society
gave the address of welcome to the initiates and
was answered by Herman Young. The men elected
to the group at this time were as follows:
Richard Van Vliet Leo A. Cannon
Arnold B. Zimmer William S. Herbert
Herman S. Young Herbert A. Spence
Joseph H. Landre Henry A. Smith
Scabbard and Blade
The Scabbard and Blade national honorary mili-
tary fraternity was founded in 1904 at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin by five senior cadet officers of
that university. The society was founded for the
purpose of establishing a better spirit of "cameradie"
among the cadet officers, and to effect a spirit of
mutual understanding between the cadet corps and
the Regular Army instructors. The fraternity aims
to create a better attitude toward military training
on the part of college students, and to combat the
insidious pacifistic propaganda which at the present
time threatens to undermine our system of military
defence.
The national organization is divided into Corps
areas, or districts, which in turn are divided into
companies, or chapters. The society now numbers
fifty-eight companies. The University of Michigan
Chapter was established in 1923, and at present has
an active chapter roll of thirty-three members, in-
cluding honorary and associate members. Honorary
membership may be accorded to one who, although
net connected with a military unit has distinguished
himself in the service of the government, or in his
civilian capacity, in matters related to our defense
program. Associate membership may be conferred
upon an officer of the Regular Army or Reserves,
or any other component of the military establish-
ment of the United States. Election to active mem-
bership is based upon the military proficiency of
the cadet officers in the R. (). T. C.
Among the associate members are Generals
Pershing and Weeks, while the Purdue Chapter
boasts as a former active member. Major Martin,
who was placed in command of our planes in their
flight around the world.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Professional Societies in the Engineering
College
We arc here calling attention particularly of the
Freshmen and Sophomores to the benefits to be de-
rived from taking active part in the professional
societies that upperclassmen have found so deserv-
ing of continuation that they have existed since the
early history of the College. In these organizations
the meetings are devoted to student discussions on
recent developments and occasionally, members of
the faculty are secured to tell of their experience in
the profession and give talks of common interest.
To some this appears to be merely an extension of
class work, but actually this is far from the case.
The atmosphere of freedom and ease that surrounds
the meetings of these organizations is far more con-
ducive to original thi night than is the class room
and hence things of importance are retained to a
greater extent. Then too, there is that element of
association, the importance of which has oft been
called to our attention. Inasmuch as men in these
circles have interests in common the benefits of as-
sociation are perceptibly greater. For an under-
classman to aim at the requirements necessary to
be eligible, to these societies, is putting the question
mildly. Hence we urge Freshmen and Sophomores
to consider the question and keep in mind the fea-
tures to which we have called attention.
"ELECTRONS"
(Continued from page 13)
may be made to respond to very weak magnetic
fields and hence to small currents. In this case a
coil of wire is wound around the tube producing a
magnetic field parallel to the filament which is also
at the axis of the cylindrical plate. The electrons
moving outward from the filament are deflected
across the magnetic flux and hence move in spirals
around the filament. For some particular value of
the magnetic field, the deflection is sufficient to
prevent the electrons from reaching the plate at all
and the current is interrupted. One such tube is on
exhibition at the Research Laboratory of the Gen-
eral Electric Co. that is so sensitive that merely
turning it in the earth's magnetic field is sufficient
to reduce the current from full strength to zero.
This tube is known as the Magnetron and is also
the invention of Dr. Hull.
The Coolidge X ray tube, developed in the Re-
search Laboratory at Schenectady, is also a tube
making use of a pure electronic emission but it is
so familiar that it need not be discussed here.
Among other electronic devices might be men-
tioned the tube with more than one grid. There are
various ways of using such tubes. Within the last
few months their amplifying powers have been un-
der investigation. With the single grid tube, radio
frequency amplification has proved disappointing
because of the tendency to feed back energy from
the plate to the grid through the tube, thus causing
oscillations in the circuit that are independent of the
applied impulses. A second grid between the plate
and the control grid acts as an electric screen to
prevent this feed-back and makes it possible to use
highly tuned circuits without setting up local oscil-
lations. It has been possible to reach amplifications
of over 200 fold in this way with a single tube and
by using several in cascade, amplifications of 30.000
have been measured.
In one form of the four electrode tube, the phe-
nomenon of secondary emission is utilized. When
an electron impinges upon a plate with a specially
prepared surface, several electrons are dislodged
from it and thus it is possible to get about three
times as many electrons to pass to another electrode
as would be obtained if the electron stream from
the hot cathode alone were used. A tube operated
in this way has some very interesting characteris-
tics, for example, it shows a negative resistance, i. e.
the plate current decreases as the voltage increases.
When the tube is made a part of a circuit, this
negative resistance may actually neutralize a con-
siderable amount of positive resistance in some
other part of the circuit. It may therefore compen-
sate for the electrical losses in an oscillating circuit
and thus greatly increase the available amplification.
When made with four electrodes this tube is called
the pliodynatron, but only three electrodes are
needed if the tube is to be used as a high frequency
generator, in which case it is called a dynatron. The
dynatron principle was first described by Hull in
the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers
of Feb. 1918.
We have by no means exhausted the list of vac-
uum tube appliances but have merely suggested in
a fragmentary way some of the means by which
modern physics is influencing engineering. That a
great commercial institution like the General Elec-
tric Co. has faith in the practical value of Electron
Physics is made evident by the fact that over half
of its enormous research laboratory is devoted to
investigations in that field. It may be regarded as
one of the hopeful signs of the times that large in-
dustrial corporations are able to see that it pays to
maintain great research laboratories for the develop-
ment of pure science.

Echoes from the Graduates
Joseph A. Bursley
JOSEPH Aldrich Bursley was born in Fort
Wayne, Indiana, June 14, 1877. He was grad-
uated from High School of that City in 1895 and en-
tered the University of Michigan in the fall of the
same year. In his youth he was always more or less
interested in engineering and it was while visiting
the Michigan campus in his
last year in High School,
that I'resident Angell, who
was a friend of the family,
influenced him to register in
the University. Bursley was
the second man to be ad-
mitted to the Engineering
College after it was detached
as a separate school from the
Literary College, and was
graduated in mechanical en-
gineering in 1899. He was
an active member of his
class, being its treasurer one
year, a member of its foot-
ball team for three years and
class track manager during
the senior year, besides
taking part in the activi-
ties of the Comedy Club
and the Friars Club. The
name of the latter organiza-
tion, although unfamiliar to
most of the present student
body, probably revives many
happy memories in the
minds of alumni.
For three years after graduation Bursley worked
as a special apprentice in the shops of the Pennsyl-
vania Railroad in Fort Wayne. At the end of this
time he went abroad and, after spending six months
travelling in Europe, he returned to Fort Wayne
and entered his father's wholesale grocery business
early in 1903. A few months later he was elected
a member of the City Council and took an active
part in its affairs. Desiring to get back to engin-

JOSEPH A. BURSLEY
eering he wrote to Professor Allen, who was head
of the Mechanical Engineering Department of the
University, with the hope of getting into construc-
tion work, but he was offered instead a position as
instructor in the Steam Laboratory which he ac-
cepted at the beginning of the second semester in
February 1904. He expected
to remain in this work only
until the following June, but
decided to return the follow-
ing fall and has been with the
University of M i c h i g a n
almost continuously ever
since that time. Today the
Dean recalls with a twinkle
in his eye with what great
trepidation he once walked
across the campus to teach
his first class, his heart in
his mouth and his legs
fairly quaking in his boots.
Dean Bursley has done
much work in Industrial En-
gineering and allied sub-
jects. He became interested
in this work in 1910 when
the Scientific Management
movement first gained im-
petus in this country. In
1913 he was granted a two-
year leave of absence from
the University which he
spent in the East, working
with industrial engineers in-
stalling Scientific Management systems in the
plants of the New England Butt Company, Provi-
dence, R. I., the Tabor Manufacturing Company of
Philadelphia, The Eaton, Crane &amp; Pike Company
Pittsfield, Mass, and ethers. He returned to Mich-
igan in the fall of 1915 and immediately began
teaching courses in Industrial Engineering in ad-
dition to his work in Mechanical Engineering.
Dean Bursley's knowledge of Industrial Engin-

eering was of considerable value to the Government
during the World War. Within a week after the
United States entered the conflict, one course in In-
dustrial Engineering was revised to apply to the
handling of army stores. The War Department
immediately became interested and, following the
precedent set here at Michigan, established similar
schools in various parts of the country. Mr. Burs-
ley was commissioned Major in December 1917 and
was stationed in Ann Arbor as Commanding Officer
of the Ordnance Training School. Later he was or-
dered to Washington as Chief of Instruction for the
Ordnance Department and had charge of all train-
ing schools carried on by the Department in this
country. In May 1918 he was transferred to the
Detroit District as Chief of Plant Section, his work
consisting mainly in locating facilities for the manu-
facturing of ordnance materiel. In 1919 he was ap-
pointed Lieutenant Colonel. He served his country
until the fall of 1920, his last duties being Chief of
the Detroit District Salvage Board to dispose of
some twenty million dollars worth of ordnance ma-
teriel which had been accumulated in the Detroit
District.
Since his return to the University in October
1920. Professor Bursley has been very active in
University affairs. At President Burton's request
he was Director of the Housing Bureau in the emer-
gency situation arising during the great influx of
students immediately after the war. In February
1921 he was appointed Dean of Students, which
title is familiar to all and in which capacity we
know him best. He is an active supporter of the
Michigan Union. In fact, he was one of the original
promoters of it, having acted as Chairman of the
first House Committee when the old Union house,
which stood on the site of the present structure, was
being remodeled for use as a men's club. lie has
been a member of the Board of Directors since 1906,
was a member of the Campaign Committee and
Chairman of the Building Committee for the pres-
ent building and has acted on the Board of Gover-
nors since that body was organized."'
Professor Bursley was joint author with Profes-
sor John K. Allen of "Heat Engines," a text book
familiarly known to students in the Engineering
College and widely used in other colleges of engin-
eering since its publication in 1910. Dean Bursley
is a thirty-second degree Mason, a member of Tau
Beta Pi, Triangles, American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, Society for the Promotion of Engineer-
ing Education, Taylor Society, Society of Industrial
Engineers, and several other national and local or-
ganizations. He was President of the Conference
of Deans and Advisers of Men during the past year.
In April 1908 Professor Bursley was married to
Marguerite Knowlton, daughter of the late Profes-
sor Jerome C. Knowlton of the Law School. They
have three children.
At first one is apt to receive the impression that
the Dean is stern and rather terse but a more inti-
mate contact proves the contrary to be true and
reveals a man who is an accurate judge of human
nature, a man who can see and sympathize with
the other fellow's side of a question and, when oc-
casion demands it, can laugh as heartily as any of
us. Dean Bursley may well be held up as an exam-
ple of a broad-gauge engineer and Michigan accords
him a prominent place among her sons.

be taken aboard a small steamer or schooner, would
be especially valuable, for this would permit the
saving of the waste from the vast quantities of fish
cleaned at sea.
Another great waste in the fishery industries is
in the press water discarded by the menhaden oil
and fertilizer industry. After cooking the fish are
pressed, thus separating the oil and water from
the scrap. The oil is separated from the press water
in large settling tanks, after which the water usually
is discarded. This involves a great loss, as the
press water contains nearly all of the glue formed
during the cooking of the fish and much other
protein in colloidal suspension. A satisfactory
method of recovery of these constituents would
save many thousands of dollars for the owners of
these fertilizer factories.
The demand for high grade fish glue is much
greater than the supply. Careful studies of the
chemical composition of various fishes would doubt-
less disclose many new sources of glue stock. Sal-
mon waste and menhaden press water contain much
glue.
The tanning of shark skins on a large scale at one
factory in Xorth Carolina is a step in the right di-
rection, which eventually should lead to the organi-
zation of an important industry at many points
along our southern coasts. According to reports
there is ample demand for the products. The trou-
ble seems to lie in the difficulty of obtaining a suf-
ficiently large, regular supply of sharks. There are
other places along the coast where an abundant
quantity of these destructive marine animals could
be obtained.
During the great shortage of meat in the World
M ar considerable quantities of whale meat were
frozen and canned and sold as a substitute for beef-
steak. In 1918, 3(),(XX) cases of whale meat were
canned and 195 tons of frozen meat marketed. But
when meat became plentiful once more whale meat
was again neglected and at present practically all
of it is converted either into animal feed or fertilizer.
The public should be convinced of the value of
whale meat as food. Further studies of its nutritive
value compared with beef should be made and the
results widely published.
Vast quantities of loggerhead sponges exist along
the coast of Florida. These sponges contain a high
percentage of very pure silica in crystalline form.
As yet no one has made any use of this silica or of
the various by-products obtained in its preparation.
A few of the major problems of the fishery indus-
tries have been outlined above. Why has so little
been done towards solving problems of such great
importance? The industry has not been organized
to the extent that have most other large industries,
it has not therefore been exploited as have the meat
packing and related industries. Private individuals
and small companies lack the funds and facilities
for the prerequisite researches for the improvement
of methods and utilization of by-products.
The logical place for much of this work is the
Bureau of Fisheries. This institution, which gives
the fishermen and the industries such valuable aid,
has recently built a very fine fishery products lab-
oratory for use in the solution of chemical and tech-
nological problems. Unfortunately, Congress has
not seen fit to appropriate sufficient money to carry
out the much needed investigations, therefore much
of this equipment has remained idle.
Many of the fishermen and men of the industries
have assumed an attitude which may well be criti-
cized, for they seem to expect the government to
do all the experimental work. If men in other indus-
tries waited for the various governmental bureaus
to improve their processes, American industries
would not progress rapidly. The National Canners"
Association might well be imitated by the American
fishermen and fishery industries. For example, an
organization of fish oil, fertilizer and feed manufac-
turers could carry out scientific researches which
would greatly increase the uses of fish oil and feed.
and thereby increase the demand for these products.
Perhaps there is no single fish salting concern
large enough to carry out the necessary chemical
and bacteriological researches required for the solu-
tion of the problems of prevention of reddening of
cod and other salted ground fish and the elimination
of the danger of rusting of salted and smoked fatty
fish. An association of packers could make these
important investigations with only a small individ-
ual cost and derive mutual benefits therefrom. Many
large manufacturers' associations have utilized the
facilities of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Re-
search of the University of Pittsburgh. At this in-
stitution a research chemist especially trained for
the work is selected by the directors, who have
general supervision of the work. Here the scientist
has unusual opportunities for success, for he has
every laboratory facility desired, the use of excel-
lent libraries, the co-operation of eighty or more
chemists, and the invaluable advice of the distin-
guished men who direct the institute. All research-
es are carried out at cost at the Mellon Institute,
which is dedicated to the advancement of the in-
dustries and to the success of the fellows who con-
duct the researches.
Croups of well-trained scientists working towards
a common end, with every known facility at hand,
are almost certain to succeed if they are permitted
sufficient time. Therein lies the secret of the suc-
cess of the larger research institutions.

The Cathedral Of Toledo
By Carlos Garcia-Prada
THERE can be nothing of greater interest for
the student of the Fine Arts than the Cathedral
of Toledo, the Church Mother of Spain, the silent
and suggestive tabernacle of the most brilliant,
noble and cherished traditions of the great Spain
of Old. Nothing else in the Peninsula can give
him a better or more complete record of the course
of general events than this splendid Christian mon-
ument, which is the work of many centuries, the
sum of many individual and collective efforts, the
supreme embodiment of the prolific creativeness and
lofty ideals of a race in the prime of its power and
achievement. The venerable Cathedral, as most
examples of its kind, is by no means the expression
of a single mind's ideals and purposes, but rather
the stone, silver, glass and gold book in which
many warriors, prelates, philosophers and artists
of different generations wrote their immortal poems.
Considered as a whole and from an academic and
unsympathetic point of view, the Church may
appear absurd and even monstrous, and as such may
be the object of unfavorable criticism. If only com-
pared with a Greek temple, this Gothic fabric would
logically lose a great deal of its prestige, for in it
we fail to find or feel that willing and enthusiastic
subordination of all stone layers, carvers, sculptors,
decorators and painters to the commanding dreams
and visions of a single artist, which is so emphatic
in Greek architecture. The Cathedral is free and
spontaneous. It came into existence following sim-
ple human laws. Its builders knew no other princi-
ples than those which correspond to a pure algebra
of the imagination—the pure and unbiased rhythm
of joyful creativeness. Its incoherence and pictur-
esqueness, its grandeur and beauty are not exactly
the result of concentrated aesthetic experience and
aims, but rather the consequence of changing fash-
ions, political and economical conditions and, above
all, exalted imagery and blind vandalism. The
Cathedral, like life itself, grew slowly and harmon-
iously, but reached not its final goal of perfection.
Once the richest of all the churches of Christendom,
Xotre Dame of Toledo is today a monument be-
longing to the past: it is now a dormant organism
that spreads over its surroundings only the scents,
murmurs and glows of its former living splendors.
II.
In making even a short study of the Cathedral of
Toledo it is necessary that we should make refer-
ences to some few historical, religious and econom-
ical facts which mav lead us into a better and clear
understanding of the subject, thus avoiding any
literary or technical bias to warp our views. It is
known to everybody that whenever we try to inter-
pret architecture we cannot easily free ourselves
of certain standards of comparison and judgment
which tend to obscure the perspective of things. In
our case, we should be in great danger of misinter-
pretation if we have in mind the best examples of
French Gothic instead of studying the Spanish
Cathedral by what it is in itself.
For our present purposes it is not necessary to
make any detailed account of the Visigoth rule over
Spain before the conquest by the Moors, for it is
certain that Visigoth architecture had very little in-
fluence, if any, upon Christian art. Instead we have
to speak of the Moor's interregnum, because since
the first invasion in A. I). 711 till his expulsion from
Granada in A. 1). 1492 his life and activities ran
parallel to those of his Christian rival. So great
was the detestation in which the two races held each
other that neither of them borrowed to a great
extent from the art of the other, especially during
the years previous to the eleventh century. Thus
while the unconquered Christians of Asturias and
Aragon were developing their own art and civiliza-
tion, the Moors of the South, in Granada, Cordoba
and Seville, were bringing into existence unrivaled
palaces and mosques, entirely free from foreign in-
fluences, so carrying to perfection the traditions
they had inherited from their remote Phoenician
ancestors. Cheerful and refined, graceful and learn-
ed, the Moors of Spain hardly could mix with the
warlike, mystic and uncivilized Christians of the
North. The two races were spiritually apart from
each other. -The Christians, in the Northern part
of the country maintained their independence as
well as their relations with France. There were no
"Pyrenees" for art expansion during the Middle
\ges; in the one hand the student finds Spanish
aesthetic inspiration among the French southern
cities, even as far as in Carcassone, while in the
other he finds French systems and traditions spread-
ing over Spain to such an extent, that some of the
most important Romanesque churches in the latter
country should be considered as being mere replicas
of many of the churches of France. Such is true if
we compare the plan of Santiago de Compostela
and San Sernin, at Toulouse, or if we put San Pedro
at Hesca in front of the Cathedral of Carcassone.
These churches certainly belong to the same school.
Put Romanesque architecture, theocratic and

sacerdotal, massive and durable as it is, kept its
prestige longer in Spain than anywhere else, and
never really evolved into Gothic as happened in
France, but rather was suddenly supplanted by the
new style. There is no real continuity between San-
tiago de Compostela and the Cathedral of Toledo,
perhaps the first example of true Gothic architec-
ture in Spain.
The Moors never gave to the city of Toledo the
importance they gave to Cordoba or Granada, but
nevertheless they erected there many buildings of
great merit and filled the city with all the activ ities
corresponding to their civilization. For this reason,
at the time of the Spanish reconquest of the be-
loved city, in the eleventh century, the new Christian
rulers found there no temples for the worship of
their God, and moreover, they had no builders.
These and artists of all kinds they brought from
France. Among the Christian warriors who recov-
ered the city there were many monks from the fam-
ous Abbey de Cuny, who, in their religious fanatic-
ism, not only aimed to destroy the Mahometan rule,
but also to banish from Toledo the artistic prin-
ciples and grammar which were not inspired by
Christian ideals. Later on we shall see how far
they carried on their destructive policy.
The first stone for the Cathedral was solemnly
laid down by King Don Fernando the Third in the
year of 1227 A. D. at the site of the old Moorish
mosque which the Archbishop of Toledo had con-
verted into a Catholic church in spite of the peace
treaty celebrated between the Moorish leader and
King Alphonse the Sixth, the Liberator of the city,
according to which treaty the Moors were allowed
not only to keep their mosque but also to continue
in it the ceremonies required of them by their faith.
From that year on work at the Cathedral did not
stop till the end of the seventeenth century when
the political power of Archbishops of Toledo began
to decline.
The first Master Operandis of the Cathedral was
I'eter Peter who, according to Spanish tradition,
was none other than the Spaniard, Pedro Perez, al-
though some critics affirm he was Pierre de Pierre,
a Frenchman by birth and training, who had been
brought to Toledo by the French Archbishop. No
matter how this question should be answered, there
is no doubt that Peter Peter, if a Spaniard, had
studied carefully and thoroughly the best examples
of French Gothic architecture, and carried in his
original plans for the Cathedral the principles which
were slowly being developed in L'lle de France.
After Peter Peter there were many other architects
in charge of the monument, and we could follow
step by step, if it were necessary, the changes that
the structure suffered at the hands of those who
for social, economical or political reasons, did not
cling to the marvelous plans of its original creator.
Ill
After knowing a little of the historical setting of
the Cathedral, let us try to approach the wonderful
fabric itself. There is from nowhere a full view of
it. Unlike her sisters from other countries, which
are almost isolated, proudly revealing to the spec-
tator their magnificence and beauty, the Spanish
Metropolitan Church is almost smothered by hun-
dreds of poverty-stricken buildings. A bewildering
network of narrow winding lanes encompasses the
great structure in all sides, leaving no open space
in front of it, save a little one at the West end. It
seems that this fact begins to speak to us of Moor-
ish traditions, for we know that the Moors never
gave any importance to the exteriors of their palaces
as they did to the interiors. Fortunately, perhaps,
the very fact that we cannot get a good view of the
Church saves us the feeling of sorrow and indigna-
tion which naturally arises on account of the
changes, mutilations and additions the structure has
suffered at the hands of time and under the vandal-
ism of ignorance of artists later to those who began
its erection.
If we are in front of the West facade we are first
impressed by the massiveness of its walls. At the
same time we feel that the deep recessed doorways
of Gothic inspiration are somehow disturbed by the
Greco-Roman structure above. Then let us better
enter the church by the "Puerta de la Alegria"
which opens into the street of "la Chapineria." If
we go along this street, first we meet the lovely
Renaissance Chapel of San Pedro, then we cross a
gorgeous Plateresque iron grille, and by the "Puerta
de la Alegria," which shows the most exquisite and
fleshy audacities and refinement, we come into the
Church itself and have an almost complete view of
its seven aisles which make upon us an impression
of lowness in spite of their actual foot measure-
ments. Standing at the transept, our eyes are
mainly attracted by the magnificent altar of the
"Capilla Mayor," and especially by that part of it
called the "Transparente," a later and stupid addi-
tion in which clouds, light rays and angels mingle
in Churrigucresque profusion and confusion: it
seems that the sixteenth century artist author of
this unfortunate "transparente" was so drunk with
realism, that he pierced the thirteenth century vault
to get actual sun rays to brighten the faces of
cherubs and give greater "artistic" effect to his
composition.
It is perfectly clear that the original Master Oper-
andis planned the Church after the fashion of Notre
Dame de Paris, because at Toledo the chapels of the
chevet are so small that they are almost within the
circular outline of the ambulatory outer walls, and
because its transept reveals not the emphasis it was


Page 39
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
given in the later periods of Gothic architecture.
Nevertheless, the chevet of the Cathedral of Toledo
is almost unique. Having a double ambulatory, the
vaults—entirely French in design, rest on com-
pound piers but have a disposition that is not to
be found even at Amiens: the diagonal ribs are cir-
cular but the architect, to avoid the difficulties of
spanning a non-square area, introduced in the most
masterful manner a triangular vault (which certain-
Iv is not seen anywhere else in the world) that re-
quires additional piers but asks for no curved ridge
ribs. A comparison between the Toledo and Amiens
chevet plans will illustrate and verify our state-
ments.
The planning of the whole Church was entirely
uniform, the vaults resting on circular piers sur-
rounded by engaged shafts, some of which are of
trifoil section. But the original scheme should be
studied only at the choir and aisles, for at other
parts later additions and changes may confuse our
views. The intermediate aisles have in their outer
walls the main arcade, then a triforium gallery
formed by an arcade of cusped arches ot delicate
and refined design, and above this, and quite close
to the highest point of the vault, a rose window of
circular outline in each bay. The main arcade (that
is. the innermost arcade) is logically higher than
the others. The space above it is occupied by an
arcaded triforium, reaching the springing of the
main vault, and consisting of a series of tritoil
headed arches resting on free standing columns,
with large sculptured figures standing in each di-
vision. In the spandrels above the arches there are
heads of different design looking out from moulded
circular openings, and above all this again, small
arches are pierced which have corbels enriched
with pure and fine Gothic ornaments. The cler-
stories occupy the haunch of the vault. This part
of the Cathedral was built under the auspices of
Cardinal Cisneros, the fierce and powerful Inquisi-
tor who, in spite of his deep hatred for the Moors,
used many of them in its erection. It seems that
the architect, although he, being a thoroughly well
trained Gothic builder, could not refuse to accept
not only the cooperation of the Moorish artists, but
yielded to their influence and admitted into his
fabric Moorish elements of design which affect
somewhat the asceticism and aspiration of Gothic
lines.
From the choir down to the West end of the
main nave a great change is noticed. There we fail
to see the triforium gallery we see at the apside:
in its stead we are compelled to follow the vertical
lines, all ascending to the upper part of the struc-
ture, as if nothing could in any way check their
audacious and rhythmical soaring.
One of the most commonplace criticisms made
on the Cathedral of Toledo and other Spanish
churches is that which refers to the disposition of
the "Coro." It is true that this unique feature of
the Church disturbs the eyes of the spectator who
has been in the French, English or German Gothic
churches and is accustomed to get a complete length
view of the whole main nave. But the origin and
reason of this unusual feature should not be attri-
buted to the so-called "Spanish fondness for drama-
tic effect," nor to a mere misunderstanding of archi-
tectural perspective, but rather to a necessity
of Spanish ritual. Here we have to remember that
Spain did not want at first to accept Roman ritual
as other countries did. Besides that, in the early
days the Church of Spain found herself the owner
of many temples having short Eastern apses and
no choir, and thus she was compelled to admit the
laity to the transepts and separate the choir entirely
from the main altar, a fact which never occured in
other countries.
The said "Coro" is entered through a massive
and extremely beautiful "reja" or grill of Plater-
csque art, situated at the east side, while the former
west door-way was closed to give final place for
the Archbishop's chair. The screen work that en-
closes the "Coro" is continued as far as the altar
where it almost meets the "Transparente" of which
we spoke before. The nave screen consists of an
arcade verv richlv decorated, carried on marble and
color jasper, and reveals fully the delicacy, fancy
and great refmement of its decorators Juan Aleman
and Juan Alfonso, both of whom flourished in the
fourteenth century.
Thus far we have tried briefly to describe the
main characteristics of the Cathedral most of which
show clearly its French origin, while others express
the influence of the Moorish artists employed in its
decoration and ornamentation. But to make our
account a little more complete we have to speak
about the many chapels that were added by each
new Archbishop, and also about the Cloisters, not
only because due to these additions the Cathedral
came to be the largest in Christendom, but also
because some of them are true works of art.
The "Capilla de San Idefonso," situated at the
very end of the chevet, is supremely rich and strik-
ing. In it the capricious and free cusping and croc-
keting of the tracery work reaches at times certain
affectation. Nowhere else in the world can we en-
joy so much display of imagery and desire for
novelty. This chapel, as well as its neighbor—the
"Capilla de Santiago", is a venerable relic for in it
we do not only discover artistic expressions of
great value, but also the record of many events of
real importance in the political, social and religious

dary Saint Patron of Spain, dressed as a pilgrim,
holding his sword on high and tramping Mahome-
tans with his war-horse. In the "Capilla de San
Ildefonso" we stop to wonder at the many tombs
of Kings and Queens and Knights of romantic and
proud Castille of legendary times.
The Cloisters are carefully designed, carrying on
the same style of the Cathedral itself, and make
with it a single structure of unusual unity in this
respect. The Cloisters, from all points of view, be-
long to the Cathedral.
Our description would be entirely incomplete
without mentioning the furniture and decorations
of the Cathedral. In no other church do we know
such a marvelous display of good and bad taste,
such an unusual embodiment of fanciful moods, del-
icacy, austerity, asceticism and pagan playfulness
as in this unique monument of Spanish art. The
Cathedral, the work of priestly ecclesiastics, every-
where reveals the character and aspirations of the
lordy Archbishops who ruled the Catholic Church
for many years, many of whom were austere and
war-like as the crusaders of old, while others were
rich, aristocratic and powerful as true Lords 'if the
brilliant Renaissance. To some was due the erec-
tion of the stone frame of the Cathedral, to others
all the minute and exquisite jewels seen here and
there, in the altars and chapels, in the stalls of the
choir, and especially in the incomparable "rejas"
and "retablos." Nowhere else can we admire those
"retablos" so rich in painting and sculpture, all cov-
ered with gold and silver, where we do not know
what to marvel at, for if great was the munificence
of the prelates who paid them, so was the dexterity
of such artists as de Borgona and Berruguete who
worked on many of them. In the "retablos," the
ample use of gold, alabaster, silver and lapiz-la-
zuli gives the impression of richness, and the almost
sensual love for perfect detail makes them supreme
and glorious works of art. The choir stalls (most
of them the work of Berruguete) are simply superb:
their creator had studied in the Italy of the Qua-
trocento and had brought into the severe Christian
Church the brilliant and vigorous ideals of the
Renaissance: in the stalls—as in many of the "re-
tablos"—a feeling of earthly freedom and joy. ex-
pressed in child and girl figures and floral decora-
tions, contrasts strikingly with the noble and spirit-
ual aspirations of the Gothic lines; the hyeratism
of the purely Gothic lithic sculptures, their eternal
repose and dignity, are hand in hand with the more
vital and almost frivolous grace of the quatrocento
figurines and statuettes; and old academic forms
and lines, introduced in later years, are seen close
to the naive and spontaneous works of the Gothic
carvers. Once in the Cathedral our eyes go- to and
fro attracted by so many beautiful things: every-
where we discover jewels of different nature and
craftsmanship; chiselled silver statues; pinnacles
crowned with golden figurines; ivory caskets of
complicated work; sumptuous glittering "custodias"
and viriles of gold masterly decorated with precious
stones; enormous gilt dishes embossed with myth-
ological subjects, thus reviving the joy of paganism
in the Church of the Christian Lord.
The Cathedral, built in hard granite on its exter-
ior parts, walls, piers, flying buttresses and towers,
offers the spectator that impression of durability
and solidity he admires in ancient temples. But,
on the interior, only soft snowy stone was used. It
seems as if the hard material of the frame work had
been brought so as to protect better the delicacies
and embellishments of the Cathedral's interior.
Simple and unadorned, the piers, of the nave and
aisles ascend, free and audacious, to support the lace
work of the vaults. There is nothing so inspiring
as those piers and walls which rise from the gloomy
ground to uphold the unparalleled floration of col-
our of the stained glass windows and traceries.
It is quite impossible, in a short article as the
present, to speak of all the wonders of the Cathe-
dral of Toledo, where one breathes an exalting re-
ligious atmosphere not even felt anywhere else that
we know of. Moreover, there are no words to de-
pict such an atmosphere. How to express in written
phrases those moments in which a Beethoven's
symphony is played at the immense mediaeval or-
gans, when the rays of the rising sun penetrate the
the Church and are changed into myriads of colours
to give an ethereal existence to the dead stones, and
when the whole montrous fabric seems to trem-
ble and live a life unearthly? How to picture in
words the sweet, tender and melodious voices of
the bells that sing to the glory of God when the
Host is raised by the trembling hands of the Arch-
bishop and the hearts of thousands of people seem
to beat stronger and faster than ever? No imagin-
ative effort may help us to tell of all the marvels
of this, the Church Mother of Spain which came into
existence at a time of great Christian fervor and
grew slowly during that period of history when the
Archbishops of Toledo were the true Masters of
the world and when many of the treasures of the
Spanish Dominions (where the "sun did not set")
came to the imperial city to enrich the Metropoli-
tan Church for the greater glory of God.

A little boy from Canada who had never seen a
negro was riding in New York with his uncle when
he spied a colored lady.
"Uncle, why does that woman black her face?"
"She doesn't; that's her natual color."
"Is she black like that all over?"
"Why, yes" uncle replied.

"You'll have to shade your price a little," replied
the purchasing agent, "I have a better bid from the

"Sometime ago you publish in your voluble paper
article on female shipping steamer. I have thought
to write you about female engine on train. You
know why? Yes, they call she for many purposes.
"They wear jacket with yokes, pins, hangers,
straps, shields, stays. They have apron, also lap.
They have not only shoes but pumps. Also hose
and drag train (psgr. and freight) behind; behind

mufflers and when draft too strong petticoat goes
up. This also attract. Sometime they foam and re-
fuse work when at such time they should be
switched. They need guiding—it always require
man-manager. They require man to feed them.
When abuse are given they quickly make scrap.
"They are steadier when coupled up, but my

SELF PRESERVATION
During a train journey a man dashed down the
corridor of a sleeping car calling out:
"Has anyone any whiskey? A lady has fainted in

A flask was handed to him.
He took a liberal drink, returned the flask and
then said calmly:
"It always upsets me to see a lady faint"—Pitts-

"What was all the racket in the barber shop?"
"One of the barbers is shaving himself and trying

Mr. Courtlv (during lull in conversation): "Aw-

your hands might be a little rough, too."
Lady: "Do you think it is fair to take his candy?"
Little Boy: "I don't have to be fair—I kin lick

AN EXPLANATION NECESSARY
"I can't keep the visitors from coming up," said
the office boy dejectedly to the president. "When 1
say you're out, they say they must see you."
"Well," said the president, "just tell them 'that's
what they all say !'"
That afternoon there called at the office a young
lady. The boy assured her it was impossible to sec

"But, I'm his wife," said the lady.
"Oh, that's what thev all say," answered the boy.

INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS SHOULD BE WELL
LIGHTED.
From the employer's viewpoint, the big difference
between men who work out of doors and those who per-
form tasks inside the building, is the factor of light. Day-
light furnishes sufficient illumination outside during the
daytime working hours for men to pursue their tasks
efficiently and safely. But the proposition of getting
enough daylight into the interior of industrial buildings,
requires some thought.
It is not a difficult problem by any means, and any
employer can take advantage of daylight and utilize it for
lighting his building during the daytime, if he desires. It
is an excellent light, especially suitable for the eyes, re-
ducing eye strain and eye weariness to a minimum, and
has the great economic advantage of costing nothing.
To utilize daylight to the utmost, we must first pro-
vide means for allowing daylight rays to enter the interior
of buildings in sufficient quantity—namely, proper and
adequate windows and skylights. Many excellent instances
of buildings designed with a due regard to the importance
of daylight lighting can now be seen in many of our in-
dustrial cities. Such buildings present the appearance of
being practically all windows—"window walled," as they
are termed—and this type of daylight construction is
coming rapidly into favor, because it constitutes a more
healthy building for large numbers of employes, both
from the lighting and ventilation standpoints.
Among those who have constructed this type of mod-
ern industrial building may be mentioned: The Shredded
Wheat Co., Gillette Safety Razor Co., Lyon &amp; Healy Piano
Co., H. J. Heinz Co., Corona Typewriter Co., Skinners
Macaroni Co., Grape Juice Co., Dodge Bros., Nelson Valve
Co., Piston Ring Co., Remington Arms Co., and a great
many others.
The Larkin Co., Philadelphia, has erected a building
almost entirely glass, 85% being windows, and the Loomis
Breaker, operated by the D. L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., Nanticoke,
Pa., is literally a glass house, being 93.5% of glass. The
new buildings of the Winchester Repeating Arms Co.
have an average glass area of 58%.
An investigation covering 18 buildings constructed by
the Aberthaw Const. Co., Boston, shows that the average
window area is 57.5%.
These figures indicate how important the subject of
lighting is now considered by employers of industrial
labor, and how well the idea has been carried out by the
architects and engineers, in order that all parts of a build-
ing may receive sufficient daylight. But, in addition to
providing ample window space, there is another factor
which is equally important, and that is, equipping the
windows with the proper glass.
The bright direct rays of the sun should not be per-
mitted to strike the eye, and we must provide a means for
reducing the glare to rays which will not be too bright
This is accomplished by glass especially manufactured for
industrial windows, known as Factrolite. This glass pos-
sesses the property of breaking up the intense rays of the
sun and diffusing the light into the interior of the build-
ing in proper portions, solving the problem of sun glare.
If you are interested in the distribution of light
through Factrolite, we will send you a copy of Laboratory
Report—"Factrolited."

Saving iniinual labor is at present one of the most
important engineering problems. Though facing a
decreased supply of unskilled labor, due to restricted
Immigration, American industries are being called on
to satisfy an increasing demand for their products.
Consequently, material handling Is an Increasingly
important phase of engineering work. Forced to pro-
duce more units with fewer human hands, thousands
of plants are solving the problem through a proper
use of labor saving equipment In the movement of
materials, thereby releasing labor for other tasks,
and insuring larger outputs at lower cost.
Similarly, REX Concrete Mixers are saving labor
on construction jobs: REX Pavers are building miles
of concrete roads: REX Traveling Water Screens are
supplying clean condenser water to hundreds of large
steam plants; REX Sprocket Chain has a wide appli-
cation for efficient power transmission.
Such developments require engineering skill and

eering problems and solving them successfully.

Why do so few engineers
win to the top
-Awhile so many are lost in the crowd?
P. F. WALKER, Dean of the Knpneer-
ing School of the University of Kansas
AJ IMPRESSIVE FIGURE
in the field of technical edu-
cation is Dean P. F. Walker, head
of the Engineering School of the
University of Kansas.
With keen personal interest Dean
Walker has watched the progress
of the engineers whom he has
trained. And he has noticed that
in a very short time after their
graduation they have separated
themselves into two distinct groups.
The majority, adding nothing to
their technical training, have grad-
ually settled down into the rut of
a specialized job.
The others have come to realize
that without business training,
technical training carries a man
just about so far, and no farther.
But how can a technical man
secure the distinct and profitable
advantage of business training?
The best answer to that question
which Dean Walker has been able
to find is the Alexander Hamilton
Institute.
In a recent letter he wrote:
The danger of specialization
"For the young engineer who has left
school and pone into some position where
his time is tilled with technical matters
associated with his job, it is of the utmost
importance that the Business Course of the
Alexander Hamilton Institute should be
brought to his attention.
"From my own past experience I know
there is a tendency to let down and to per-
form only the routine work called for on
the job. This is the most dangerous thing
On this page, Dean Walker
answers the most pressing
question that challenges the
young engineer graduate
today.
that can befall a young engineer graduate.
The Modern Business Course becomes a
continual challenge and stimulus, impelling
him to go on with his work in lines that
will supplement the technique of his engi-
neering job. / recommend it without qualifica-
tion to all men who graduate from thin school."
Rather a startling statement,
coming from such a man, isn't it?
But put it to the proof yourself.
Look about you, and in case after
case you will find the specialist in
a subordinate position, while at
the head of the business is a man
who may know less about each
department than the department
heads, but whose all-round knowl-
edge of business fits him to direct
their activities.
What the Institute does
When Mr. T. H. Bailey Whipple
was Director of Education for the
great Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company, he said:
"I know of no other preparation that
equals your Course for fittingaman to grasp
his opportunity and succeed in it
when it comes.
"If conscientiously pursued,
your Course, coupled with one's
daily problems and activities, un-
questionably does for men what
experience and native ability
alone can never do."
In a few words, this is what the
Institute does:
It takes a man in any depart-
ment of industry, technical or cler-
ical, and gives him a working
knowledge of all the other depart-
ments. In a few months of inter-
esting reading, it gives him a con-
ception and understanding of busi-
ness as a whole which ordinarily
he could gain only after years of
actual experience. Automatically
it lifts him out of the class of men
of which there are too many,
into the class of which there are
too few.

Can burn low grade coals—those high In ash—in sul-
phur and clinker-forming qualities—for the following
reasons:—
1. The moving grilles keep the clinkers broken up,
intensify combustion, keep the fuel bed active and
even.
2. The rocker dump discharges the ash continuously
and automatically and keeps the fire clean.
3. Underfeed feature makes possible high capacity
and quick response to overload demands.

To Help Ton to Decide
THE manufacture of 100,000,000
blasting caps without a complaint,
and 20,000,000 electric blasting caps
with only one valid complaint involving
a small number, is the present record of
our Port Ewen plant. It is a record of
which we are not ashamed, and which
we are naturally striving to maintain;
but after all, the record itself is not the
important thing to our customers.
In any process which involves the
human factor largely, as does the manu'
facture, inspection, and testing of blast'
ing caps, perfection is unattainable. The
nearness to which it can be approached
depends upon the skill and conscien-
tiousness of the workers: and upon the
vigilance with which checks are ap-
plied by persons, themselves liable to
error, upon the performance of others
subject to the same liability. This prac'
tically perfect record of ours for a cer-
tain period should interest customers
only as it indicates that our force is able
and careful, and that our supervising
and testing are accurate.
When a manufacturer can say this,
it is difficult truthfully to say more. It
then becomes merely a question of
degree; for ability, and carefulness, and
accuracy are relative terms. We wish
it were possible to take all of you who
use blasting caps or electric blasting
caps through our plant so that you
might decide at first hand how far we
have traveled towards the impossible
goal of pefection in manufacturing. This
is not practicable, but to assist you to
form your own opinions of this, in suc-
ceeding advertisements we shall go be-
hind our record of performance and de-
scribe some of the means we use which
made the record possible.

Resistless
Force—
Controlled!
THE CHEMICAL ENGINEER has created, in
explosives, a power that can blast a mountain
or crack a boulder—dig an isthmian canal or drain
a swamp.
Today,explosives power is employed both in the heaviest and
in the most delicate operations. The scientific control of this
resistless energy has enabled explosives engineers to utilize it in
ways undreamed of a generation ago.
Recently at the Frazier Quarries of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio
Railroad in West Virginia, 60,000 pounds of du Pont dynamite
were exploded at one time to bring down five hundrtd million
pounds of stone for ballast. Literally a whole hillside was
blasted out.
But in a power house in Baltimore, du Pont explosives were
used to perform a different and delicate operation. This work
involved blasting out five concrete bases in the basement of the
building without damage to a switchboard that governed the
distribution of power over a large section of the city. While
blasting was in progress a glass of water and some wire nails
placed on their heads in an upright position near the blasts were
not disturbed by the explosions.
So, in dynamite, we have a servant that will do our bidding in little things as well
as big—a power that can be made to perform our work easier, better and cheaper in
all industries.
The du Pont Company has been making explosives since 1801. With the devel-
opment in explosives manufacture have come many improvements to expand the use
of the product. And it has been the privilege of du Poot, through exhaustive re-
search and experiment, to lead the way.

Drawing Instruments and every modern
facility is afforded Pease craftsmen to in-
sure the highest degree of accuracy, finish
and quality.
The experts who designed Pease Draw-
ing Instruments, and who supervise their
construction, studied the weak features of
every other instrument, both domestic and
imported, and by perfecting mechanical de-
tails and methods of manufacture, produced
a complete line of drafting instruments
which are strong, well balanced, accurate
and exceptionally easy to manipulate. In
keeping with their accuracy and precision,
they are given the finest finish obtainable
and then complete sets of various assort-
ments are fitted in genuine morocco pock-
et style cases.
When lower priced sets arc desired,
Pease-Franklin Drawing Instruments are
furnished. These are made with the same
dies as the higher priced instruments and
are equally accurate, but arc furnished in
imitation leather cases and are not so highly
polished. Literature and prices on both
styles of drawing instruments will be sent
on request. Just write for Catalog C-10.

THE WEST SIDE TENNIS CLUB STADIUM. FOREST HILLS, LONG ISLAND
DURING THE DAVIS CUP MATCHES
KENNETH M. MURCHISON. ARCHITECT CHARLES S. LANDERS. ENGINEER
America's Tennis Stadium at Forest Hills, Long Island, was built by The Foundation
Company in record time. It was begun in April and completion was promised for
the Davis Cup Challenge Round on August 51, 192J. It was actually used for
the Women's Nationals on August 13. The West Side Tennis Club, in choosing a
general contractor, selected The Foundation Company because its record guarantees
trustworthy workmanship and speed of construction without sacrifice of economy.
The
he Foundation Company is an organization of construction engineers
specializing in the building of difficult superstructures and substruo
tures. The world'wide reputation gained in its early history for trust'
worthy underground construction has followed it into the field of
general engineering contracting. Among the structures completed
by The Foundation Company are buildings of every \nown type.

Harnessing
Niagara Falls
for the
First Time

What Engineering
Owes to Faith
THE pioneer harnessing of Niagara Falls in 1892,
like all great engineering feats, was the result of
the co-operation of many able and constructive
minds. There were no "older engineers" on this
work, with younger assistants, as is now common,
because there were no "older" engineers then. All of
them were young men in a young business, optimistic,
enthusiastic and willing to take long chances.
The original Niagara installation represented prog-
ress based largely on faith because there were many
features of construction proposed at that time which
Westinghouse Engineers refused to accept, and which
time has shown to be utterly impracticable.
Thus, in effecting a compromise, the three funda-
mental features of heating, insulation and regulation
of the 25-cycle machines as built, were vastly different
from the original designs. Time verified their judg-
ment, the ten original generators operating success-
fully for more than a quarter of a century.
Looking back, it is gratifying that those young men
served engineering so courageously, because truly it
was an undertaking that taxed their faith to the limit.

ROLLER BEARINGS
Greater simplicity and reduced
weight are fundamentals of me-
chanical refinement. The constant
tendency toward simpler, lighter
machinery of all kinds is accel-
erated by the ever-increasing
use of Timken Tapered Roller
Bearings.
Their design is inherently adapted
for Dual-Duty — the carrying of
radial loads and thrust loads and
resultant loads simultaneously.
By taking advantage of this multi-
ple ability of Timkens the designing
engineer avoids much more com-
plicated construction otherwise
needed to do the work. With Tim-
kens he immediately reduces the
number of parts and consequently
he eliminates excess weight.
And since the Timken principle
also permits greatest load to be
carried per unit of space required,
Timken mountings are most com-
pact, so that housings are smaller.
When any one housing or unit may
be made smaller and lighter, all
related parts in turn may be sim-
ilarly refined. Thus Timkens, in
themselves a refinement, favorably
influence the entire mechanism in
which they are used.
And Timken influence in bettering
a machine never ceases, because
when that wear which eventually
must follow motion does come, its
deteriorating effects need not be
tolerated in Timken-equipped
mechanisms. Timkens can be ad-
justed to function as when new.
