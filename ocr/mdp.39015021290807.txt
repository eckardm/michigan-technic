Pointing the way to the
advertised brand
Many a "sale" made by advertising has gone
to a competitor because the purchaser did not
know where to buy the advertised brand. Tele-
phone men evolved a plan to make it easy to find.
They created a "Where to Buy It" service in
the classified telephone directory. There—beneath
the advertised trade marks — Buick, Goodrich,
RCA Victor, General Electric and many others
now list authorized local dealers. Thus telephone
men complete the chain between advertiser and
consumer—increase the effectiveness of advertis-
ing—help manufacturers and dealers to increase
sales—help consumers to get what they want!
Because they apply vision to subscribers' prob-
lems, Bell System men continually increase the
value of telephone service.

Seven smokestacks in a row
Etched against the morning's glow;
Mirrored in the silver of the river—
Wandering, wide-eyed, hand in hand,
You and I in wonderland
Watched the dawn dip one pink toe and shiver
I said they were pipes of Pan,
Not just smokestacks made by man.
You said we would pipe a tune upon them.
We would walk across the stream
On the sun's first brazen beam;
Make a little love song croon upon them.
Seven smokestacks in a row
Stand there waiting in the glow
Every dawning, all atune but dumb.
I have stood there waiting, too,
In the dawn, and called to you:
"Pipe, my sweet!" But you have never come.

Water Supply
By Lawrence C. Whitsit, C. E. '32
NEARLY everyone living in cities objects to the
results which come from the iron content of
water and at one time or another has ex-
pressed the wish that this iron might be removed. Yet
most people would consider it impossible or, at best, a
very costly project. To the contrary, this report will
show that it can be accomplished by a few simple proc-
esses and relatively inexpensively.
The first part of the discussion
will include a detailed consideration
of the main objections to be found
with high iron content and the prin-
cipal conditions which are causing
the general complaint against the
iron in the water. This is followed
by a brief outline of the theory of
removal; and a description of the
treatment processes that are gener-
ally employed with a comparison of
the general methods, as to simplicity,
effectiveness, and cost. Next there
will be given illustrations of several
removal plants in operation with the results of their
experience.
Objections to the Iron Content
For many centuries men have sought clear, cold,
palatable water for their personal use. More recently
we have come to demand water which not only fulfills
these conditions, but is also free from bacteria which
might be injurious to our health. Undoubtedly hard
waters are pure from a health standpoint, but the water
always has an unpleasant taste which the people come
to overlook as a matter of necessity, but which will
always be objectionable to them. A bottle or pitcher
of water standing in the open air for a short time as-
sumes a disagreeable, muddy-yellow color which is dis-
tasteful to the aesthetic sense of the careful housekeeper.
And what resident has not noticed the offensive liber-
ation of gas which occurs each time water is drawn
from the tap?
Not only does iron make the water objectionable for
drinking, l.ut also it increases the burden of the house-
wife. The water has a disgusting tendency to discolor
all plumbing fixtures and the reddish-brown deposit
can only be removed by hard scrubbing. Furthermore
this staining property of the water makes laundrying
very difficult and unsatisfactory. The clothes tend to
have a dirty yellow appearance after several washings
This and the following art-
icle, "Dynamic Balance in In-
dustry," are the two first prize
winners of the contest spon-
sored by the A. I. Ch. E. and
the A. S. M. E. Much credit
is to be given to their authors
for the research necessary in
compiling these articles.

and this can only be avoided by ex-
treme care in boiling and bleaching.
The industries also suffer from
this obnoxious quality of the water,
almost as much as the individual
householders themselves. Commer-
cial laundries must have their own
treatment plants
to supply them
with a purified
water; and for
such industries

cerns and the

like, hard waters are totally un-
satisfactory.
The community at large also suf-
fers, along with the individuals and
the industries. The superintendent
of the water department gets more
complaints about the iron content,
than from all the other reasons for
complaint put together. Not only that but these de-
posits tend to clog service mains and to interfere with
the operation of the meters. Any sprinkling done with
this kind of water discolors the grass, walks, and
buildings; this does anything but enhance the beauty
of a city.
Present Conditions
In many cities the system of distribution mains has
the fault of being built with a good many dead end
mains serving small groups of people. The water
which is certain to have had some slight aeration in
pumping, stands almost stagnant in these short stretches
of blind pipe lines and the iron settles out on the sides
of the pipe in a rusty coating. At times when there is
a sudden heavy demand on the system, such as a fire,
this deposit will be stirred up and mixed with the water
giving it a brick reddish color. Such a condition is
known as "red water" and renders the water almost
unfit for domestic use.
An entirely different cause producing a somewhat
similar offensive condition is due to growths of iron
bacterium in the pipes, particularly in dead ends. The
chief of these is Crenothrix, a microscopic bacteria
which occur in iron bearing waters. It thrives best in the
dark and is found most frequently in water that con-
tains little or no free oxygen, but considerable amounts

of carbon dioxide. The bacteria have the power to oxi-
dize the iron which ordinarily is in the soluble ferrous
state to the insoluble ferric condition. On precipitat-
ing out, the iron collects on the sheath of the bacteria
or on the walls of the pipe. These growths may become
so abundant that they will partially clog the pipe, but
will ordinarily go unnoticed until after the death and
decay of a large quantity of the bacteria which will
produce bad odors and unpleasant tastes. Occasion-
ally the deposits will break loose or "slough off" and a
rusty, foul smelling water will be discharged in that
section.
Obviously the way to prevent the troubles due to
Crenothrix is to inhibit their growth by removing the
iron. The Water Departments of many cities have
recently been treating the water with chlorine which
slowly kills these bacteria, but of course this can only
be temporary and a somewhat expensive measure.
Not only would the "red water" and Crenothrix
problems be obviated by iron removal, but the same
treatment process would greatly reduce the free car-
bon dioxide content. The presence of this gas in the
water makes it slightly acid and causes a corrosive ac-
tion in pipes and boiler tubes.
Theory of Removal
In some waters, such as those with a high organic
content, the removal of iron becomes quite difficult
and complicated. But some preliminary experiments
have shown that it will be relatively simple to obtain
an almost complete removal from waters of low organic
content.
The ground water carries the iron in the soluble fer-
rous form, largely as ferrous hydrate and possibly
some as ferrous
bi- carbonate.
During aeration,
which is ordi-
narily the first
step in removal,
the water loses
a good share of
the dissolved car-
bon dioxide and
in turn takes up
oxygen. This
oxygen changes
the iron from
the ferrous or
unoxidized con-
dition to the fer-
ric or oxidized
state. The com-
plete change may
well be divided
into four steps,
and is outlined
in this manner
by R. S. Watson as follows:
1. The absorbing of oxygen during aeration, by which
the oxidation is affected.
2. The oxidation of the ferrous hydroxide depends
upon the hydrolysis or the decomposition of water, as
is expressed by the following equation:
4Fe(OH)2 + 4HO, + O2 = 4Fe OH)3 + 2H,O.
3. The ferrous hydrate becomes oxidized into the in-
soluble ferric hydrate which exists in the form of a
colloidal suspension and remains in solution, until
finally—
4. The transformation of the colloidal suspension
into the insoluble, gelatinous ferric hydrate is affected
by various conditions, such as a detention period or
flowing through a gravel, coke, or sand filter, which
finally causes precipitation of ferric hydroxide (rust).
The second step or hydrolysis is dependent upon the
presence of hydroxyl ions and so increasing their con-
centration by the addition of lime or caustic soda will
hasten the reaction. Also it is easier to precipitate iron
from hard waters than from soft due to the presence of
bivalent ions, such as SO4. The last step is perhaps
difficult to understand, but in a filter the water comes
in contact with millions of square feet of sand surface
onto which the particles of iron hydrate stick forming
a gelatinous layer or coating which in turn catches other
particles. Any iron which may still exist in the fer-
rous form on coming in contact with this iron hydrate
film seems to be converted into the ferric form by a
physiochemical reaction and it too collects on the sand
grains. While there still seems to be some uncertain-
ty concerning the exact character of the reactions, the
method outlined seemed to be the most probable way
in which the iron changes from the soluble form to the
final insoluble precipitate.

Treatment Processes
Next we must turn to some of the treat-
ment processes by which these results may
be accomplished. There are numerous vari-
ations of each process, but in general the
principle is about the same in each case.
There are many patented devices upon the
market, such as intricate aerators, but on
the whole it is unnecessary and many times
a waste of money to purchase these articles
when as good or better ones can be designed
and built to fit the particular conditions. We
will divide the complete treatment processes
up into the individual steps: first, aeration;
second, coagulation and sedimentation;
third, filtration.
Aeration.
Aeration is accomplished by bringing the
water in intimate contact with the atmosphere,
water absorbs the air and the oxygen that it contains
is responsible for the oxidation of the iron compounds
in the water. Also freely exposing the water to the
air permits some of the confined gases, such as carton
dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, to escape, which in itself
improves the character of the water.
It is really quite easy to obtain sufficient aeration of
the water, and as Weston points out:
"One part of oxygen will oxidize seven parts of iron,
2 FeO + &gt;2O2 = Fe.,O;l.. that is, one cubic centimeter
of oxygen will oxidize ten milligrams of iron, and that
water under ordinary barometric pressure (760 mm)
and ordinary temperature (20° C) will absorb a maxi-
mum of 9.19 parts of oxygen per million, or 6.23
cubic centimeters per liter, so it will be realized how
easy it is to supply the necessary oxygen to a water
to be purified. Often a leaky suction, badly packed
glands, or a small air cock will admit a small but suf-
ficient quantity."
There are a number of different devices or means
of providing the necessary aeration. In some places
an air lift pump is used to lift the water from the
wells. Of course, this provides an adequate aeration
and in many plants this type of pump is giving very
good service. Ordinarily though, some special device
is employed for aeration and of the multitude which
are in use we will merely consider three typical means
(a) sprays, (b) splash boards,
and (c) overflow trays. Some
applications which would be
quite satisfactory in a southern
latitude, would not work well
here due to the water freezing
during the winter season.
However, even during the
cold months the water coming
"&gt;—.^C* from the ground is a good
deal above the freezing temp-
erature, so there will be no

water is allowed to stand for an extended period in
pools exposed to the atmosphere. Experience sub-
stantiates the claim that more effective aeration is ob-
tained by breaking the water up into fine drops or thin
sheets and exposing them to the air, than by forcing the
numerous fine bubbles of air through the water.
Sprays: This type of equipment breaks the water
up into a fine fan shaped spray as it passes through
the air. They may be a stationary or a revolving type,
though ordinarily a group of stationary spray nozzles
are arranged in a grid work pattern over a contact
filter or a collecting reservoir.
Splash boards: An inexpensive aerator is sometimes
constructed by allowing thin sheets of the water to flow
down an inclined board surface which has obstructions
fastened to it in such a manner that the water is caused
to ripple and splash as it runs down the incline. An-
other adaption of this principle is obtained by loosely
filling an open box with broken crockery or tile and al-
lowing thin streams of water to splash their way down-
ward through the broken mass. A cheap installation
of the latter form is giving very good results at Punta
Gora, Florida. Large wooden boxes are used with
thin slats across the bottoms which support several feet
of broken terra cotta pipe.
Oi'erflmi' trays: This type of aerator consists of
shallow pans superimposed one above the other in
such a manner that the water falls over the edge of the
upper tray in a thin sheet and is caught by the next
tray underneath. By having the water discharge over
both sides of the trays and using a series of trays
quite close together it is possible to aerate a large flow
of water in a relatively small area. Due largely to
the troubles that might be caused by freezing unless the
aerator was housed in, this type finds its most general
use in the southern parts of this country.
Sedimentation and Coagulation
After the water has been thoroughly aerated, it is
necessary to allow some time for the completion of the

Dynamic Balancing
in Industry
By R. C. Mansfield, '32 M.E.
Machine for checking and correcting dynamic unbalance of a crankshaft
DYNAMIC balance may be defined as a state of
rotative equilibrium. Any rotating body, if in.
dynamic balance, can be run at different speeds
and positions of support without causing vibration. A
similar state for a body not rotating is called static
balance. In static balance a body at rest has no un-
balanced masses tending to cause it to rotate. In gen-
eral, all rotating bodies, unless corrected, are in both
static and dynamic unbalance.
Corrections for static balance have been made since
rotating parts for machinery were first built, but not
until around 1910 was dynamic unbalance corrected in
the construction of machinery. The latter became nec-
essary when machinery was developed for high speeds
of operation.
As an example of the importance of this balancing,
at the time of the World War in one of the largest
electrical manufacturing companies, the design of turb-
ine generator units had reached the maximum size.
This was not for the want of electrical conductors
of sufficient size, nor for lack in strength of materi-
als but it was for a lack of methods to balance heavi-
er rotating parts. Soon the obstacle was overcome
and a machine was designed and built to balance
rotors much greater in size than had been built up
to that time. It is evident, now, that dynamic bal-
ancing is an important branch of machine shop
practice.
Theory of Dynamic Balance
The theory of dynamic balance provides for a
neutralizing of the centrifugal forces set up in a
rotor by its unbalance with weights placed so as to
create forces equal and opposite the unbalanced
forces. The problem in dynamic balance is to find
the amount of weight, and the correct position in
which to place it. As static balance is a funda-
mental part of dynamic balancing, the conditions
for static balance will be discussed before the con-
ditions for dynamic balance are formulated. These
formulae will then be used in an actual problem.
Conditions for Static Balance
When an unbalanced shaft rotates, it causes cen-
trifugal forces to be set up that exercise periodic im-
pulses on the bearings. These impulses cause the
bearings to vibrate, which in turn induces vibrations
in the frame and surroundings. The amount of cen-
trifugal force developed by a small unbalance is shown
graphically in Figure 1. For instance, an unbalance
equivalent to one ounce in weight and at a distance
of one inch from the axis will be equal to a force of
16 pounds when rotating at a speed of 3000 revolutions
per minute. The values are found from the equation
F = W X w2r, -T- g (1)
where (W) is the weight of the unbalance in pounds,
(r) the distance this weight acts from the axis of ro-
tation in feet, (w) the angular velocity of the shaft
in radians per second, and (g) the acceleration due to
gravity (—32.2 feet per second, per second).
If an arbitrary weight (W,) is placed diametrically

Obligations of a
Contract
By Prof. Walter C. Sadler
An aerial view of the Law Club
IT is provided in the Constitution of the United
States, Article I., par. 10; cl. 1, that, "no state
shall pass any law impairing the obligation of con-
tracts." The effect of this constitutional limitation has
been far reaching, and, as a matter of fact, involves
many issues of great interest to engineers. It is perti-
nent to examine the cases in order to determine exact-
ly what laws come within the constitutional provision.
Louisvillle R. R. vs Mottley. 55 L. ed. 297 deals with
a situation where a law passed by Congress impaired
a contract. It appears that the Mottley family were
injured in a railroad accident and part of the settle-
ment included perpetual railroad passes for Mr. and
Mrs. Mottley. That is, there was specific contract
between the Mottleys and the railroad company to the
effect that Mr. and Mrs. Mottley would be exempt
from the payment of railroad fares during the re-
mainder of their lives. In 1906, some years subsequent
to this contract, Congress passed a law prohibiting the
railroads from issuing passes to non-employees. The
supreme court decided that while this law directly im-
paired the contract, the constitutional limitation d'd
not apply to Acts of Congress, and that the passes were
void.
In Ruggles vs Washington County, 3 Mo. 496, the
issue was raised whether the laws of the Territory were
restricted to the same extent as though the Territory
were a state. Ruggles, a contractor, had built a court
house for Washington County in accordance with a
contract he had with the county. The contract price
was never paid in full and eventually the territory of
Missouri passed an act which precluded Ruggles from
collecting in full for his work. The court held that the
territorial law was the same as though it were passed
by a state, and conflicted with Art. I of the Constitu-
tion of the United States.
The ordinance of a city also appears to come within
the constitutional limitation. This is based upon the
principle that the state has given the force of law to
city ordinances. It is also a fact that the acts of boards
and commissions are. in general, within the constitu-
tional limitation, based upon the delegation of legisla-
tive authority. In fact, the court so held in the leading
case of New Orleans Water Works Co., vs Louisiana
Sugar Co.. 31 L. ed. 607.
Police Power of State
This application of the law might give rise to some
very embarrassing situations. For instance, suppose
a state legislature granted the XV company a perpetu-
al franchise to manufacture and sell intoxicating
liquors, while a subsequent legislature should prohibit
the manufacture and sale of all such liquors within its
borders. It is desirable that the fabric of the law should
be so woven that the act of the subsequent legislature
should be effective. In other words, this class of legis-
lation, known as the police power of a state, is de-
signed for the public welfare and must be reserved by
the state. The state should reserve to itself the sov-
ereign power to legislate for the public health, welfare,
and convenience of its people.
By a state charter of 1878, the Texas Railroad was
exempted from liability for injuries to persons even if
the railroad were admittedly negligent. This was a
contract, of course, between the railroad and the state.
Six years later the legislature passed a general law
specifying that injured people or their relatives could
recover for injuries due to negligent railroad operation.
This legislation resulted in the litigation of Texas R.
R. vs Miller, 55 L. ed. 789, wherein it was decided
that while the state law impaired the obligation of a
contract, it was still valid. The court held that the
statute was an exercise of the police power of the
state, and that the state could not contract away this
sovereign power of the people.
Another exercise of police power of a state comes a
little closer to engineering work. In the Raymond
Lumber Co., vs Raymond Light Co., 159 P. 133, liti-
gation developed over a contract for water rates. In
order to induce a saw mill to locate in the lumber town
of Raymond, Washington, the water company gave
them a very low water rate of $5.00 per boiler used
per month. The water company served the public gen-
erally to the limit of its capacity and was therefore a
public utility. The Public Service Commission subse-
quently objected to the rate on the basis of unfair dis-
crimination. The court held that while the higher rate
impaired the obligation of a contract, the subject of
water rates was one of public welfare, and was within
the police power of the state.
Right of Eminent Domain
The exercise of the Right of Eminent Domain is
another type of sovereign power of the state. This
power cannot be bartered away. If a railroad has a

WITH the opening of a new school year, we
are again given opportunity of meeting per-
sonally new professors and instructors in
the various departments of our university. It seems
fitting then that we should, during this period of in-
troductions, present to you one of our former profes-
sors, a graduate of our own Engineering College.
Without a douht, old friends and students of Mr. J.
C. Parker will be highly pleased to hear of his where-
abouts and recent activities while his friends-to-be will
most certainly be interested in his colorful career.
In order to make the introduction complete, we must
tell these new acquaintances about the periods in Mr.
Parker's life during which he was active here as a
student and a teacher. He entered the University and
classified in the Mechanical Engineering department.
His work drifted a good deal toward the more exact
sciences, physics and mathematics, but he finished the
studies required for a B.S. degree in Mechanical En-
gineering and the degree was conferred upon him in
1901. Being now free to pursue whatever task he
pleased, he did some advanced work in mathematics,
physics and structural engineering. After pursuing
this work for a year, he received his A.M. degree. His
final degree was conferred upon him after three years'
work done ni absentia. It was in 1904, after receiving
his E.E. degree, that he turned toward the industrial
field.
He now followed the work that had fascinated him
while still a student and he obtained a position with the
Ontario Power Company's plant at Niagara Falls, one
of the largest contemporary hydroelectric undertakings.
It was in connection with this company that he served
as assistant to the engineer in charge of construction
and design. His advanced work at the University
seemed to stand him in good stead for the first section
of the Ontario Power Company's plant was completed
in approximately one year. It was in 1905 that he
went to Buffalo to assume duties as assistant to the vice
president and chief engineer of the construction com-
pany which built the lines of the Niagara, Lockport
and Ontario Power Company from Niagara Falls to
Syracuse. It is here very interesting to note that this
was the first 60,000 volt transmission line to be con-

J. C. Parker
structed. Construction work of this caliber and of
this pioneering nature did not go without notice. The
pioneer at that particular time was a valuable man to
have, and the Rochester Railway and Light Company
put him in charge of the engineering department. His
pioneering habit led him this time to something quite
different in connection with engineering. During the
period in which Mr. Parker was affiliated with the
Rochester concern, engineers were more or less in-
clined to forget economics in their lust for more scien-
tific knowledge. When the larger industrial units such
as Mr. Parker helped construct became more numerous,
technical men began to realize that to efficiently oper-
ate a power plant required more than a handbook, a
set of steam tables and a lot of bolts and nuts. It was
with this idea in mind that Mr. Parker set out to make
an investigation of the power company's works. After
collecting some valuable economic data concerning
power plant operation, he added to his list of accomp-
lishments the organization of the power sales engineer-
ing division in the above mentioned company.
1915 saw a rather abrupt change in Mr. Parker's
activities. At this time the University of Michigan
began to realize the practicability of having a man on
their teaching staff who had had some really practical
experience in the particular field of Electrical En-
gineering. Mr. Parker had in his eleven year's service
as a sort of commercial engineer accumulated an abund-
ance of ideas and facts which could be advantageously
taught to students in engineering. He was therefore
recalled in this year by the University as professor in
Electrical Engineering. For seven years this depart-
ment was handled by Mr. Parker in his characteristic-
ally efficient manner. It was with a great deal of re-
gret that he resigned his position here to enter once
again the commercial field.
It was in 1922 that he left the University to take a
position as electrical engineer with the Brooklyn Edi-
son Company. Higher mathematics and physics still
held his attention for a considerable time but he finally
abandoned this for the task of standardizing and simpli-
fying the methods of production, design and construc-
tion. In the last few years he has served on various

To Be or Not to Be
Educators of today seem to differ widely in their
evaluation of a cultural education for the engineer.
Dr. Karl T. Compton, president of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, in a recent address at Detroit,
took issue with the slogan "More cultural courses for
students in professional schools." In engineering at any
rate, he believes the fundamental science courses are
more and more regarded as cultural as well as pro-
fessional, education. Engineering structures, methods
and formulae may seem merely technical to outsiders,
but to Dr. Compton they are products of the imagina-
tion, expressing "the intellectual beauty of form and
relationship''.
Dr. Compton sees more in an engineering structure
than a mere assemblage of steel and iron. To him
man's culture is largely expressed in and limited by
his tools. "Culture has been defined as the sympathetic
understanding and appreciation of life. Today, and
even more so in the future, our life activities and even
our thoughts are so interdependent with science and
engineering that life cannot be understood and appre-
ciated without considerable knowledge of engineering."
In contrast to this, Dean Emeritus M. E. Cooley,
speaking before an assembly of freshman engineers,
expressed the hope that as many as possible would avail
themselves of the opportunity ofForded to take courses
in the Literary College, for the cultural background
which they would provide. In his opinion, it is the
cultural courses which make life more livable. No mat-
ter how much technical knowledge a man has, if he has
not acquired a sufficient understanding of the things
which regulate everyday life—economics, political sci-
ence, philosophy, psychology and the rest—his way will
be rough.
Dean Cooley feels that it is up to the rising genera-
tion of engineers to disprove the idea that an engineer
is an uncouth individual who spends his time in the
backwoods building roads and bridges or, dressed in
greasy overalls, makes machinery "go". A well rounded
education, to him. is one that fits a man for his pro-
fession and at the same time equips him to become
a participating member of society on an equal footing
with his fellows.
This is the situation as presented by two prominent
engineers and educators—if you as a student have any
other ideas on the subject, write in to the Technic and
we'll do our best to publish them.
Outside the Classroom
Present day college life puts much more stress and
importance on the factor of extra curricular activities
than one would ever have guessed would happen had
he been in the university a few decades ago. This only
recently developed viewpoint has attained such wide
acceptance partly because of the sanction it has been
given by most industrial managers who do not now
seem content to hire merely for class marks and tech-
nical knowledge but also reward those attributes which
may be picked up only by a wholehearted interest in
student organization and function. There is a large
percentage for the ambitious and hard working student
these days if he is willing to devote the major portion
of his spare time to teaching himself how to present
himself well before his fellows, how to be at ease with
strangers in talking over matters of common impor-
tance, and how to organize and cooperate in various
types of enterprise.
The freshman engineer, coming to the University of
Michigan for the first time, has a wealth of opportunity
for such activity in the Engineering College as well as
on the other side of the campus and would certainly
fit in better. It is the object of this little series of in-
formal articles which are to appear in the editorial page
of the Technic to acquaint the new or uninformed
student with the aims, purposes, and activities of the
student organizations which flourish in his very midst.
Most of them, we are grieved to discover, have a scope
of activity little known to the average student no mat-
ter how long he has been in our college. This lament-
able condition is, however, perfectly natural in as much
as the ordinary run of students has little contact with
student organizations and is kept so busy with his
studies that, though he may realize that he is missing
something valuable and worthwhile out of his student
life, he really has very little opportunity to change the
situation. He knows little of what is going on and soon
becomes more or less of a self contained individual
with few outside interests.
Information regarding student activity thus not only
does not seem to be general but even appears to be
hopelessly lacking if the results of recent inquiries
mean anything. In the hope of extending the new
class an introduction to the various organs of student
activity and their controllers, then, the editor is writ-
ing this series of chats about the important underclass
organizations and the reason for their several exist-
ences. Any comments or opinions in the interest of
furthering the usefullness of these articles will be ap-
preciated at the Technic office. We can only hope that
they will fill satisfactorily a long felt need.

The problem of darkness as an aid to escap-
ing prisoners has been solved at Great Meadow
State Prison, Comstock, N. Y., through the in-
stallation of directional floodlighting about the
walls and buildings by engineers of a promi-
nent illuminating engineering laboratory. The
need of such illumination for protective and
policing purposes was brought out during the
series of prison breaks and riots which took
place throughout the country during the last
two years, causing loss of life and considerable
property damage.
Previous attempts to provide lighting of
prison walls, at Great Meadow and other insti-
tutions, have too often resulted in spotty and
irregular illumination. Guards have been un-
able to obtain a clear, uninterrupted view of
either the inside or the outside wall surface and
have been hindered by the glare of the lights. The old
type of lighting also resulted in the placing of so many
lights about the prison grounds that some were always
in danger of being tampered with.
The primary purpose of the new installation is to
project a continuous path of light along both sides of
the wall, and thus clearly reveal to the guards any per-
son approaching from inside or out. Floodlights have
been mounted beneath the balcony at each guard tower,
and external visors prevent all annoying glare to the
guards on duty. Three gateway entrances are also
lighted. Wall sections lighted by a single floodlight beam
vary in length from 250 to 400 feet.
This directional floodlighting affords economy in
utilization of light upon certain objective areas, and
provides a safety factor since the switch control for the
camparatively few installations is located out of the
possible range of damage by prisoners. Following in-
spection and final adjusting of the lights, Warden J. H.
Wilson stated that the new system reduced to a mini-
mum all hazards of prisoner escape and of outside com-
munication.
Since this novel installation has proved so extraordi-
narily successful in this great state prison in New
York, it might well be considered as worthy of being
tried elsewhere. There are few who can not realize
the hazards which have been thrown on certain sections
of our nation lately by the oft recurring news of prison
breaks. Anything which will relieve the danger of more
such terrorizing happenings is certainly a necessity for
the protection of the public. We should all be inter-
ested and hope that a more successful quelling of thes-j
outbreaks may soon be realized. And does not this
appear to offer a satisfactory solution?
A New System
Are there any of us who can even profess to be old
timers around this Engine School who do not recall
with a feeling of disgust or something akin to that the
means of classification which held sway until the pres-

East Engineering Building, the home of the Technic
ent semester? We will remember the toil of a whole
afternoon, making up schedule after schedule in a
vain attempt to get classes in, only to have them closed
in our faces as we waited in line too long to have the
O.K. put through. And the mobs at the door, all intent
on shoving in and finishing as quickly as possible, made
life uncomfortable for the unfortunate classifier. There
never seemed to be the slightest semblance of system or
orderliness, the whole business being one mad scramble
to get through and get out.
A change had seemed absolutely necessary and ob-
vious for some time but nothing was being done alxmt
it very rapidly until Triangles, the Junior Honor So-
ciety, provided the little bit of impetus which was
needed to put over the trick. It was a group of last
year's Juniors who earned, thus, the undying gratitude
of all Engineers, both present and future, who may
happen to grace our campus. And we should all know
to whom we owe our appreciation.
But we mustn't take too much credit from our fac-
ulty classification committee, either, for it was they who
worked the plan out in its every detail and arranged
things so that the idea might function as smoothly as
it surely did. They deserve lots of credit for their good
work and we only hope that they may succeed in main-
taining such standards for the classes to follow. More
power and more success to them! They've made, by
far, the best system we've seen.
The heart of the classification is simplicity itself.
We simply divide the several classes up according to the
various lines of specialization. Then each one of these
groups is subdivided, according to scholastic rating, and
each one of the units thus made is assigned a definite
classification period, announced well ahead of time.
Everything runs smoothly and without confusion.
Nothing could be fairer. We hurry to be the first to
congratulate everyone responsible and hope it lasts un-
til something even better is developed.

Notes of the
Professions
The inventor with
the zinc arc lamp
The Zinc Arc Lamp
At the meeting of the Michigan Section of the Il-
luminating Engineering Society, Dr. H. C. Rentschler,
Director of Research of the Westinghouse Lamp Com-
pany, introduced for the first time his new hot cathode
positive column zinc arc lamp. Dr. Rentschler believes
that the lamp will find many special uses, since zinc
gives very strong red and rather strong blue lines, but
no yellow or green. It will be useful for colored pho-
tography in the red, where no green or yellow light can
be allowed. The lamp has possibilities for decorative
red lighting, and when combined with mercury (in
separate bulbs) produces a good quality of white light.
The zinc arc lamp also has possibilities with respect
to the photo-electric cell. The red light of the lamp
will produce greater contrast between red and green
objects, red objects appearing bright red, and green
objects appearing black. This greater contrast between
different colors should improve the accuracy and sensi-
tivity of the photo-electric cell.
Dr. Rentschler also mentioned signal work and flood-
lighting as other uses to which the zinc arc might be
put.
New Rayon Process
Rayon is made from cotton or wood pulp or both.
Most of the rayon made at present in the United States
is made by the viscose process, in which the raw materi-
al is dissolved in carbon bisulfide and "regenerated"
in an acid bath as fine rayon threads.
A new process, discovered by W. H. Furness after
many years of experimental work, has been put into
use in a new rayon plant at Glouster, New Jersey and
is described in Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering.
In the Furness process, the cotton is dissolved in a
mixture of copper hydroxide and ammonia and re-
generated as a thread by squirting this solution into a
bath of caustic soda.
While the cupro-ammonia process is not in itself
new, the method of preparing the cotton solution and
the ingenious machine used has made the process so
different and economical that it is believed it may revo-
lutionize the rayon industry. By the use of this method
the rayon thread is spun, chemically treated, washed,
dried, and twisted all in one continuous machine. Sev-
eral steps in the conventional rayon process are thus
omitted, and this means saving in initial cost, labor,
power, and floor space.
Smoothness-Measuring Device
The Los Angeles County Road Department has re-
cently constructed a device similar to a recording-
straight-edge, which is now being used for the purpose
of measuring the smoothness of pavements. The ma-
chine consists of a light metal frame, lOl/2 feet long
and approximately six inches square in cross-section.
Exactly in the center of the frame, a wheel is mounted
on a vertical slide, and roller bearings allow the wheel
to rise and fall so as to keep contact with the road sur-
face. The vertical motion of the wheel is transformed
into the horizontal motion of a fountain pen which
moves across profile paper on a metal table connected
with the device. As the fountain pen moves across the
table, the profile paper moves along the table at a
speed proportional to the speed of the whole device
along the road.
The device is not only of value in determining the
condition of any pavement, but is useful in discovering
the effects of given types of traffic along different types
of road.—From Civil-Engineering.
Studying the Corrosion of Welds
The effect of corrosion is becoming so important
in welded boilers, pipes, containers for oil and chemi-
cals that the Westinghouse Research Laboratories are
studying it with special apparatus. It is known that,
in a weld of low-carbon steel, cor-
rosion may be expected to start
in the zone where weld metal
meets parent metal, oxides and
other heterogeneous particles
hasten corrosion.
In order to enlarge the present
scope of knowledge in this field,
a special corrosion device has
been built which greatly hastens
the slow process of rust. In it
the test specimens are subjected
to intermittent immersions in a
corroding liquid. The apparatus
suddenly immerses the samples,

Sigma Rho Tau
The University of Michigan chapter of Sigma
Rho Tau is entering its fourth year of intercollegi-
ate activity with an enviable record. The stump
speakers, with three highly successful years as their
trophy of Merit, propose an even more extensive
program of project speaking, debates and oratory
this year. Organized primarily to develop and pro-
mote speaking abilities of engineering and architect
students, the society under the guiding hand of
Professor R. D. Bracket! has made rapid progress.
Last year, Sigma Rho Tau with bold affirmative
and negative teams on the platform had not lost
one formal debate. This year with a strong group
of seasoned members to form the nucleus, the or-
ganization will no doubt bear more fruit of success.
To encourage the hard task of the older members,
about one hundred freshmen, abundance of raw ma-
terial, have signified their intentions to become
affiliated with the organization, indeed a promising
aspect.
The subject of argumentation for the ensuing
year once decided, the organization will immedi-
ately plunge into active work. The debate teams
will then again demonstrate on the platforms of
Ann Arbor, Detroit and Lansing, meeting collegiate
institutions housing local chapters of Sigma Rho
Tau.
The organization itself offers prizes to its mem-
bers who are most skilled in the art of oratory.
Distinct prizes being offered in three divisions of
field speech, namely, orations, projects speaking and
story telling. This alone affords interest and keen
competition among fellow members as well as being
a great sport.
Glider Club
Shooting out into the wide open spaces in a
glider is indeed a fascinating sport. Once out in
thin air, with no mechanical powers to rely upon,
the pilot must utilize his knowledge of favorable
air currents, which are the only means of "hang-
ing" up there in the skies. When out for the first
time one really senses a thrill.
The University of Michigan Aeronautical Society,
glider section, with their modern equipment and
fully capable instructors affords these and many
other interesting features of gliding. The club's
ship, a modern Franklin P-S-2 primary ghder,
bought two years ago, is in constant use. Every
afternoon a party of enthusiasts tow the ship to the
airport where novices are taught the simple con-
trols and go through the maneuvers "soaring up"
to get the feel of the air.

Two

Surveyors
Formed five years ago, the Glider Club is growing
rapidly producing some very capable pilots, as was
proved only this past summer. Three members of
the club left for Elmira, N. Y. last July, taking with
them the club's ship, to participate in the annual
glider contest. Endurance, distance, spot and vari-
ous other contests were run-off. The preliminary
tests disposed of, the big hops came next. And
right here is where our own Stan Smith took off
one sunny morning from a convenient mole hill and
anchoring to a passing cloud, stayed up for what
later proved to be the official endurance record.
Elgin Marshall, too, added to the club's glory when
he placed third in the distance glide. He had a
devilish time trying to land before dark.
Unfortunately, President Shaefer is not back with
us this semester, but Mr. McDowell, a very capable
leader will fill his shoes temporarily. With a large
group of new members attending the first meeting
another link in the chain of success is anticipated.
Local Student Receives Award
THREE students of chemical engineering have
received recognition from the American Insti-
tute of Chemical Engineers and have been
awarded prizes for general excellence in chemical
engineering as determined by the solution of a prac-
tical problem open to over 1400 students. In this
national competition, sponsored by the Institute
and held at 23 institutions of learning, first prize of
$100 was awarded to George K. Hickin of Central
Lake, Mich., a student at the University of Michi-
gan; second prize of $50 went to Edmund Field of
Chicago, a student at Armour Institute of Technol-
ogy; and third prize of $25 was won by Melvin J.

A ship wrecked traveler was washed upon a small

and explored with utmost stealth. Discovering a thin
wisp of smoke he crawled toward it fearfully, in appre-
hension that it might be from a campfire of savages,
but as he came close, a voice rang out sharply, "Why in
hell did you play that card?" The castaway already

"Thank God!" he exclaimed. "I'm among Christians."

At a recent luncheon there was no clergyman present,
so the host singled out a pious, solemn-looking man
in black coat and tie, with a religious appearance, and
asked him to pronounce a blessing.
The gentleman after being addressed put his hand to
his ear and said: "I see you are talking to me, sir, but
I am so damned deaf that if hell froze over I couldn't

WILLING CONVERTS
A couple soon to be married were looking for a
house in the country. Satisfying themselves that it
was suitable, they departed for home. During the
journey, the young lady was very thoughtful, and when
asked the reason for her silence, she replied, "Did you
notice the W. C.?" (meaning the water closet) He,
not having done so, wrote the landlord asking where it
was situated.
The landlord did not understand what a W. C.
meant, and after thinking it over for a long time, came
to the conclusion that it meant Wesleyan Church, and
wrote as follows:
"Dear sir: I very much regret the delay in replying
to your letter, but I have the pleasure of telling you
that the W. C. is situated nine miles from the house
and is capable of seating 250 people. This is very
fortunate if you are in the habit of regular attendance,
but you will be glad to know that a great many people,
who can spare the time, take their lunches and make
the day of it, while others take autos and arrive just
in time, but generally are in a hurry and cannot wait.
The last time I went, just six months ago, I had to
stand up the whole time.
"It may interest you to know that a bazaar is to be
given to furnish the W. C. with plush seats as the mem-
bers feel this to be a long felt want. I mention the
fact that it pains me not to be able to go oftener."

reactions and also it is an advantage to settle out as
much of the insoluble precipitate as is possible. First
the water is run through mixing baffles and then is
given an extensive detention period in a basin which
will ordinarily permit a good deal of the iron sludge to
settle out.
However in some cases the precipitate is in such a
finely divided state that even an extremely long sedi-
mentation period will not cause any appreciable amount
of settlement. Under such conditions the application
of a coagulant will often hasten the settlement. Ordi-
nary lime is employed, though a finely divided clay will
also give results and at a low cost. Many plants use
sulphate of aluminum, which is one of the best co-
agulants.
Filtration
Even with a prolonged sedimentation period, a good
deal of the finely divided precipitate will remain in
suspension and can only be removed practically by
filtration. Roughing or preliminary filters and rapid
sand filters are the two types used in iron removal
processes; the former being made of coarse gravel or
fine stone and the latter a thick layer of sand supported
on a bed of graded gravel. Roughing filters are some-
times used alone, but ordinarly are employed as a
preliminary treatment to reduce the load on the rapid
sand filters.
The roughing filters seem to remove the sludge by a
contact reaction and in some plants large amounts of
the precipitate are collected in the beds. Frequently
this must be flushed out and it is probably wise to
place a small sedimentation basin after the roughing
filters to catch the sludge that occassionaly sloughs off
the stone. Coke roughing is also satisfactory.
Rapid sand filtration is the usual final step. While
these are more expensive to build they give a steady and
uniform performance. Not only do they separate out
the iron precipitate, but they also remove other sedi-
ment and also any bacteria which might have found
their way into the water. These are designed of fine
sand with a fairly rapid filtration rate although it is
probably not wise to attempt to exceed 150,000,000
gallons per day for each acre of filter bed area.
Some Operating Removal Plants
There are numerous iron removal plants throughout
the country due to the great prevalence of iron bearing
waters. Each plant has its own special conditions, but
all seem to conform to one of several treatment proc-
esses. It is impossible to give many illustrations, but
the construction and results of a few will be described.
The ulant at Punta Gorda. Fla., reduces the iron con-
tent from 19.6 to O.I p.p.m. by aeration and an upward
flow contact filter of graded gravel. The plant requires
very little care and the maintenance cost is extremely
low. The filter beds are down-washed once a day, and
occassionally are given a vigorous upwashing with suf-
ficient water to give the particles a good scouring.
Memphis, Tennessee, has recently completed a plant
which is giving very satisfactory service. The method
of treatment consists principally of aeration and fil-
tration. The former is accomplished by pumping the
water into forty shallow trays which have perforated
bottoms . The water runs out of the holes and trickles
down through several trays filled with coke into the
receiving reservoir which serves as the reaction basin.
Finally it is passed through rapid sand filters. The
average operating cost for three years has been about
$3.34 per million gallons of water treated.
The removal plant at La Porte, Indiana, purifies a
water which is quite similar to the Ann Arbor water
supply. In this installation the water is aerated by
sixty-four spray nozzles, discharging over a concrete
splash tray. It then collects in an aerator basin where
eighty pounds of alum is added for each million gal-
lons of water. Next it is completely stirred up in a
mixing chamber from which it flows into a settling
basin providing an average detention period of nine-
teen hours. The final process consists of rapid sand
filtration. The iron content varies from 1.3 to 15.0
p.p.m. and reduction leaves 0.2 p.p.m.
OBLIGATION OF A CONTRACT
(Continued from page 10)
charter, (a contract) to use certain lands for its line,
this right is not exclusive. For instance, if a second
railroad should desire to cross the older tracks, the
state can grant the new charter even if it does impair
the obligation of the contract with the first railroad.
That the law should be thus is justified on the ground
of public welfare, and is consistent with the rules on
the exercise of police power.
Proceeding logically with this question the issue is
raised as to how far the right of Eminent Domain
should be extended. Should the state, upon the pay-
ment of due compensation, be able to take over the
property itself and absolutely vitiate an existing con-
tract? This was the issue in the West River Bridge
Company vs Dix, 12 L. ed. 535 where the state had
granted a charter to the bridge company to build a toll
bridge, and then subsequently endeavored to take over
the bridge as a part of the regular state highway sys-
tem. The state won its point, showing the extent to
which the legislature may go in the interest of public
welfare.
In the early days of development in this country,
many plans were inaugurated to encourage growth of
the community. One plan granted special charters to
banks and railroads exempting them from future state
taxes in consideration of a portion of the profits of the
concern, or free service to the state. Subsequently the
legislature endeavored to tax the concerns and the com-
panies replied that they had a contract with the state
Page Twenty

that contract. In examining these tax cases the courts
scrutinized the consideration very closely. If there
is no consideration the contract is void, but if there is
consideration to the state, the courts will not permit
the obligation to be impaired. In the interest of the
public the contracts are construed very narrowly.
Franchises and Licenses
A matter of particular interest to public utility en-
gineers irises in the case of franchises, and these fran-
chises are within the law even if a municipality is a
party to the contract. Thus in the case of Louisvilie
vs Cumberland Tel. Co., 56 L. ed. 934 the city was
served by two telephone companies and desired to im-
prove its service by having only one. It tried to repeal
the charter of the Cumberland Company after twenty-
six years of service. The court held that the fran-
chise was not revokable by its terms, and that the ac-
tion was unconstitutional.
The question of a license is somewhat different than
a franchise for a license is a privilege granted subject
to revokation at will. Examples are found in the
license laws for engineers, lawyers, and doctors. Sup-
pose that a subsequent legislature decides to raise the
standards of the medical profession and revokes all
outstanding licenses, requiring a new and very rigid
theoretical examination of all applicants. No one can
complain on the basis that the law is an impairment of
the obligation of a contract for the license is not, in
fact, a contract.
Functional Test
These cases may appear in confusion, but the "func-
tional'' test should clear up any apparent inconsisten-
cies. The functions of a municipality may be classed
as governmental and proprietary. The governmental
includes work to promote public health, safety, and con-
venience; such as fire departments, boards of health,
etc. Taxation, administrative and judicial acts also are
classed as governmental. The proprietary includes
those activities where the city is entering the field of
business; as running electric light plants for profit,
operating street car systems, etc. The constitutional
limitation of impairing an obligation of a contract can-
not apply to the governmental functions. The state
and its political subdivisions must have its hands abso-
lutely free to protect the public welfare, health, and
convenience of its people, and no contract should so
operate as to jeopardize such freedom of action. On
the other hand, the city may engage in some business
enterprise as supplying public light, harbor develop-
ment, or street railway service. Contracts made in this
field should be subject to the same limitations as con-
tracts between private individuals.

ratio is found by trial with a known balance.
The plane of unbalance is found by the marks on the
chalked surface. It is known from studies in vibra-
tion that a body rotating above the critical speed will
oscillate with the light side out, and below the critical
speed with the heavy side out. At the critical speed
which here is the speed corresponding to the speed of
the pendulum, these change quickly from one side to
the other. Also the oscillations are more pronounced
at this speed. These facts are used to accurately locate
the plane of unbalance.
The stylus that is used to mark the shaft is held in
a linkage such that as the stylus is pushed back by the
growing oscillations it is moved along the shaft thus
causing parallel marks to be traced.
The Cisholt Balancing Machine
The automotive industry required a balancing ma-
chine for relatively light parts to be balanced quickly
and accurately. The Gisholt Machine Company of
Madison, Wisconsin, manufactures an interesting type
of machine for this purpose. The machine is typical
of the heavy-base type of machine.
If in the equations for dynamic balance derived in
the first part, the point of suspension or the rotor is
placed at a plane of correction the forces AA and AB
are equal to zero, and the correction force is A in the
correction plane. This idea is incorporated in the
Gisholt machine by having the frame pivoted at one
of the correction planes. The movable headstock is
allowed to slide on the rays of the frame until it bal-
ances the body over the fulcrum point. A motor turns
the body being balanced up to a certain speed, then it
is released to idle down through the synchronization
speed. A long flat spring underneath gives the frame
a pendulum action. On the head there is a slot across
the diameter with a weight capable of sliding in it,
thus creating a known unbalance.
To balance a body it is placed on the frame and
turned up to speed and released. The maximum amount
of unbalance is noted on the scale and by dividing that
by the amount of unbalance for one division of the
scale the actual unbalance is found. The sliding weight
is now moved over toward the circumference enough
to give the same unbalance, and the rotor run through
the synchronization speed with the amplitude of the
oscillations again noted. Dividing this value by the
previous value taken on the first trial the quotient
equals the length of arc to a unit circle from which
the angle in degrees is found between the two unbal-
anced forces. The direction this angle measured is

ance into relation with the known, the body vibrates, the
angle has been measured the wrong way around the
dial.
The amount and position of the unbalance is now
known, and the body can be corrected directly.
The Losenhausenwerk Balancing Machine
A new method of building up and opposing unbalance
in the heavy-base type of machine to correct and meas-
ure an unknown unbalance is found in a dynamic bal-
ancing machine made by the Losenhausenwerk Com-
pany in Dusseldorf, Grafenburg, Germany.
The novel method of balancing used on these ma-
chines is that two electric magnets are used to build
the opposing force. They are energized intermittently
at a frequency equal to the speed of the body being
balanced. By now changing the phase angle till the
frame quiets down to small oscillations the magnetic
impulses come into the plane of unbalance. Then if
the current is increased in the magnets till there are
no oscillations the strength of the magnets is the same
as the amount of unbalance. This strength is read on
an ammeter graduated in inch ounces of unbalance.
The phase angle is found by stopping and noting the
relation between the body and a dial contact switch
which has turned with the body and gave the electric
impulses to the magnets at the right frequency.
Conclusions
These types of balancing machines each have cer-
tain advantages and disadvantages. With Akimoff
rolls the great advantage is that they are able to balance
all sizes of rotors. Such unshapely bodies as marine
propellors are balanced on this machine. The cost of
these rolls is low in relation to other types of machines.
The disadvantage most evident is that they require a
great deal of time and calculation to balance any rotor.
The type represented by the Schenct 1 to 50 Ton
Balancing Machine can be built up into very large
sizes. At the Westinghouse Electric and Manufactur-
ing Company there is a machine capable of taking
rotors up to 100 tons.
The Gisholt machine is designed for production
work, and it is an excellent type for automotive work
such as balancing crank-shafts, clutches and flywheels.
This machine is capable of balancing small parts. This
type would be difficult to build in large sizes.
The German magnetic machine is interesting though
the accuracy must be lower than one such as the Gish-
olt machine. This is another production machine. It
has the great advantage of only starting and stopping
once for each rotor balanced. This company has since
built a machine that gives the dynamic balance without
first finding the static balance as do the others.
There are many other machines on the market but
nearly all use the principles shown in these four ma-
chines.

Nothing More Modern
The Philadelphia Savings Fund Society has recently
erected a new 33-story building containing many mod-
ern improvements, especially in its electrical equipment.
Elevator service is 20 per cent faster than in similar
types of structures. Satisfactory illumination is in-
sured, for 65 per cent of the outside wall area is glass,
and the indirect lighting system provides a uniform il-
lumination of 19 foot-candles on all normal working
planes. A complete recirculating air cooling and con-
ditioning system, with full temperature and humidity
control is installed. Extensive facilities are provided
for telephone, radio, television, telegraph, stock ticker,
telautograph, and synchronous time services. The total
load of 5000 kilowatts is supplied by 13.2 kilovolt,
three phase, 60-cycle circuits from two independent

engine is of the solid-injection, two cycle, double-acting
type. Each of the nine cylinders has a 33-inch bore
and a 59-inch stroke. The engine makes 115 revolu-
tions per minute and develops 22,000 horsepower.—

annually, was to demonstrate concretely the inter-
est of the Institute in the careers of undergraduate
students in chemical engineering and at the same
time to establish a definite standard of excellence
among embryo engineers. For many years the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers has
maintained student chapters at 23 accredited col-
leges and universities having courses in chemical
engineering and through its committee on Chemical
Engineering Education, has sought to set up cer-
tain standards of education designed to give stu-
dents the proper educational background for later
professional work.
The problem set before the students was a practi-
cal one, requiring a thorough grasp of the technical
and economic considerations. A specific situation
at an oil refinery was outlined, requiring additional
heat exchanger capacity in connection with a pro-
posed new fractionating unit. The question was
how much heat exchanger capacity was technically
and economically warranted by the facts of the
case and the student was instructed to convey his
findings and recommendations in the form of a re-
port which could be read and understood by a busy
semi-technical executive in not to exceed three
minutes. In grading the reports the Committee on
Award took due cognizance not only of the accuracy
of the assumptions and computations, but also of
the form in which they were reported.
The Committee on Award of the American Insti-
tute of Chemical Engineers consisted of Walter J.
Whitman, Standard Oil Company of Indiana, Whit-
ing, Ind.; Earl P. Stevenson, Arthur D. Little, Inc.,
Cambridge, Mass.; H. O. Forrest, M. W. Kellog
Co., Englewood, N. J.; and Francis J. Curtis, Mer-
rimac Chemical Co., Everett, Mass.
Mr. George Keller Hickin, winner of the first
prize, was born at Central Lake, Michigan, Septem-
ber 1, 1909. Mr. Hickin graduated from the Alpena
High School in 1927, entered the University of
Michigan in 1928 and graduated with the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering in
August 1932. Mr. Hickin has been partially self-
supporting since he entered high school. His occu-
pations embrace a wide variety of jobs as is evi-
denced from the following list: paper route, small
theater, creamery, grocery clerk, work on State
Forest Reserve, telephone line construction and
switchboard wiring, coal passer on a lake freighter,
waiter, laboratory assistance in qualitative and
quantitative analysis, work in the Engineering- Re-
search Department of the University of Michigan
on vapor phase cracking of petroleum and on an in-
vestigation of Portland cement. Nevertheless while
in college he found time for outside activities. In
his freshman year he made the freshman wrestling
squad and won championship of his class in his
weight. In his sophomore year he received the
Robert Campbell Gemmel Scholarship. In his Jun-
ior year he was secretary of the Michigan Student
Branch of the American Institute of Chemical En-
gineers. In his Senior vear he was Vice-President
of the Michigan Student Branch of the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers, and Vice-Master
of Alpha Chi Sigma.
Mr. Edmund Field, winner of the second prize,
was born in Chicago, January 22, 1911. In Febru-
ary 1928 he graduated from the Austin High School
and entered Crane Junior College. In the following
June as highest ranking student in his high school
class, he was offered and accepted a one year schol-
arship at Armour Institute. He graduated from
Armour Institute with a 95 average. He was elected
to Phi Lambda Upsilon in his third year, and for
two years was student assistant in the Department
of Mathematics. Mr. Field has received an assist-
antship in chemistry at Northwestern University
where he plans to specialize in physical chemistry
and mathematics.
The enrollment in the engineering college this
fall numbered twelve hundred and ninety-nine
students.

Automatic Rifle
By Harold P. Messler, '33E
THE choice of a rapid-fire weapon to replace the
Springfield service rifle involves a consideration
of three specific problems. First, ammunition
available at the present time must be satisfactory for
use in a rifle of this type. Second, the weapon accepted
should be superior to other semi-automatic rifles. And
third, this semi-automatic rifle should possess char-
acteristics that are decided improvements upon those
of the Springfield.
A semi-automatic rifle is defined as one extracting,
cocking, ejecting, reloading, and locking from the en-
ergy of the powder charge. In common terms this
series of operation is referred to as reloading. As a
result the expression "auto-loading" is often used to
replace the technical title "semi-automatic."
The demand for a shoulder weapon capable of de-
livering a high rate of effective fire has been recog-
nized by several manufacturers of small arms. The
War Department has called upon these companies to
submit types of semi-automatic rifles that may prove
suitable for adoption.
With the proper and adequate ammunition manu-
factured today, the Pedersen semi-automatic rifle will
function without the disadvantages common to other
rifles of similar type, and more satisfactorily than the
Springfield.
The adaptability of present day ammunition for use
in a semi-automatic rifle may be directly accounted for
by the development of fixed ammunition and discovery
of smokeless powder.
Prior to the development of fixed ammunition a suc-
cessful auto-loading weapon was out of the question,
for no mechanism could be arranged to store bulk
powder with caps and shells, and place them properly
in the chamber of a gun. In the elementary attempts
to design a semi-automatic rifle using unfixed ammuni-
tion, it was necessary to provide either a number of
barrels or numerous chambers into which the loads
of powder and balls could be placed before firing.
Obviously the added weight of extra barrels would pro-
hibit the utilization of the weapon for infantry maneu-
vers. A rifle with an action similar to that found in
revolvers was developed, but the long stroke of the
trigger required to rotate the cylinder and discharge
the piece proved unsatisfactory. Also, since the time
required to reload the cylinder greatly exceeded that
necessary to fire all the charges, the average rate of
fire was low. Fixed ammunition eliminates these dif-

ficulties because the primer, powder and projectile are
rigidly assembled in the cartridge case. Consequently
the cartridges may be stored in a magazine and fed into
the chamber by mechanical means.
As well as furnishing possibilities of mechanical
handling, fixed ammunition provides a uniform density
of loading. This is a primary requirement for the suc-
cessful operation of any semi-automatic rifle. Since
such a rifle depends upon the energy of the powder
charge to furnish power for reloading, it is evident that
each charge must act within the limits for which the gun
is designed. That is, enough energy must be liberated
to do the required work upon the breech, but it must
not be so excessive that it will damage the breech
mechanism. A powder charge compressed by tamping
will burn more slowly than one undisturbed. Since
the forces brought into play are a function of the rate
of the evolution of energy, they will vary with the rate
of burning. Evidently, then, if the powder charge and
ball are loaded into the barrel by means of a ram rod,
the results obtained will fluctuate because of the varia-
tion of the density of powder charge. With machine-
loaded, fixed ammunition, however, the density of
loading is practically constant and each cartridge will
yield practically the same reactive forces.
While fixed ammunition is a progressive develop-
ment, it would be of little value in the advancement of
auto-loading small arms were it not for the discovery of
smokeless powder. The propellant formerly employed,
black powder, deposited a solid residue in the barrel
of the gun and also, because of the high temperatures
produced during the explosion, soon eroded the bore.
The solid residue, unless swabbed out after every few
shots, so seriously impaired the rifle's accuracy that the
weapon soon lost its effect. Smokeless powder, on the
other hand, leaves the barrel practically clear, and the
rifle may be operated continuously without cleaning.
Also, the temperature developed during the combus-
tion of a smokeless powder charge is low enough to
increase greatly the life of the bore. Naturally a rapid
fire rifle must be capable of continuous operation, and it
must have a longer useful life than a single loading gun
for it is required to fire a great number of shots, two
features attained by using smokeless powder.

The forerunner of
the present Pcd
ersen Rifle.
The outstanding difference that exists between semi-
automatic rifles lies in the manner in which the breech
mechanism functions. The principles, gas operation,
Blish, recoil, and blow-back, have been developed to
perform the series of duties commonly called reloading.
The principle of gas operation is most familiar to
military men for the Browning rifle is of this type.
After the powder is ignited, the gases formed during
the combustion expand and force the projectile through
the barrel. As the shot approaches the muzzle, it un-
covers a port in the bottom of the barrel, allowing the
gas under high pressure to act upon a piston. The
pressure on the piston furnishes the force required to
push the breech mechanism to the rear, and at the same
time, it stores energy in the closing spring. While
the Browning automatic rifle has been fairly satisfac-
tory, the gas port, piston, and cylinder are difficult to
clean. Consequently, they are subject to corrosion from
the primer salts. Also, the long piston and gas cylinder
tube extend practically to the muzzle of the piece and
detract from its balance.
The Blish principle is the least successful of all and
does not merit a great deal of consideration. This
principle is based upon the supposition that two slid-
ing surfaces forced together under high pressure will
friction lock, and after the pressure is relieved, sliding
will begin. As a result, the bolt is locked by a helical
thread so steep that the preliminary high pressure will
hold the surfaces together. During the lower pressure
range, the bolt will unscrew and move to the rear. 1 f
the cartridges are not well lubricated, they will either
be torn apart during this action or else stick in the
chamber. Obviously this feature cannot be tolerated
in any fire arm.
The successful functioning of a recoil-operated semi-
automatic is dependent upon the ratio of the mass of
the moving parts to that of the projectile. To maintain
a high enough ratio, the barrel is attached to the breech
closure and both move to the rear. Consequently the
barrel must be placed upon some form of slide to cause
it to return accurately to the original position. While
this feature can be accomplished within the limits of
accuracy of a shot gun. the additional weight required
to maintain a rifle barrel in alignment is excessive.
Also the moveable barrel prohibits the attachment of
a bayonet. This latter fact detracts from the gun's
value as a military weapon.
The blow back principle is very similar to the recoil.
In the blow back, however, the entire reaction of the
cartridge case is spent against the bolt. The barrel is
fixed. This operative principle is quite satisfactorily
utilized in the design of pistols and automatic small-
bore rifles. The weight required in the breech closure
to resist the reaction of larger caliber ammunition is too
much for the principle to be employed without some
alteration. If the breech is not sufficiently massive, the
cartridges will be torn in two as they are in Blish oper-
ated guns.
Since each of these four principles possess character-
istics decidedly undesirable; the Pedersen is a modi-
fication of the most practical, the blow-back principal.
The massive breech construction necessary in other
blow-back rifles is eliminated by constructing the breech
closure in the form of an eccentric toggle. During the
period of high pressure the energy is but slightly ab-
sorbed in overcoming the inertia of the breech, while
the greater portion is dissipated through the stock.
Following this period of high pressure, the breech
closure extracts, cocks, ejects, reloads, and locks. For
simplicity this sequence of operations will be illustrated
by dividing the motion into three parts, the power
stroke, movement of the bolt to the rear, and movement
of the bolt to the front.
The power stroke may be defined as that portion of
the movement of the breech occurring while the pro-
jectile is traveling through the barrel under high gas
pressure. Consequently it is necessary for the breech
to remain locked or sufficiently closed to prevent a blow-
back, or failure of the cartridge case. Also, there must
be enough energy stored in the breech during the period
of high pressure to complete the operations after the
pressure has dropped and the bolt is allowed to move.
This requirement is satisfied in the Pederson by means
of an eccentric toggle. This toggle allows very little
motion during the power stroke, but stores adequate
kinetic energy in the mass of the breech closure to
complete the movement to the rear..
The vertical components of the forces exerted upon
the cam surfaces are relatively small compared to the
horizontal components which transmit the greater part
of the thrust to the receiver through the fixed crank
pin. The torque established upon the conrod and the
crank, however, causes the conrod to roll upward upon
the cam surface of the bolt and down upon the crank

conrod.
During this operation, the design of the cams allows
only a very slight movement of the bolt to the rear.
The inertia of the bolt, conrod, and crank, coupled with
the resistance of the closing spring, so nearly equal the
turning moments in the breech that the bolt is not posi-
tively locked at the time of firing.
Although the toggle eccentricity remains practically
constant throughout the power stroke, it greatly in-
creases in the period immediately following, and the
bolt moves more rapidly to the rear, extracting, cock-
ing, ejecting, and uncovering another cartridge in the
magazine. Extraction is accomplished by a method
similar to that used in all small arms and requires no
discussion.
Extraction is accomplished, the firing pin is with-
drawn, and the piece is cocked during the preliminary
movement of the bolt to the rear.
As the conrod attachment rises with the conrod, the
cocking hook withdraws the firing pin. A continuation
of the toggle action compresses the spring and forces
the firing pin to the rear until the sear notch drops
over the lug on the firing pin. The piece is now cocked.
To release the mechanism it is necessary to apply a
force to the base of the sear. The sear will pivot
about the sear pin and disengage the firing lug.
When the bolt continues to open after the power
stroke, the contact between the conrod and the bolt
changes from the cam surfaces just below the centerline
of the crank pin to the doll's head on the conrod and the
mating recess in the bolt. The ejector emerges from the
bolt and kicks the empty case out the top of the re-
ceiver. The bolt, moving to the rear, uncovers a fresh
cartridge in the magazine. \Yhile the crank rotates
upward about the crank pin, the buffer follower rolls
upon a cam surface in the rear of the receiver, com-
pressing the closing spring as it slides in a "T" slot
on top of the crank.
The crank first rolls upon the crank pin, then turns
so that there is a perceptible space between the pin and
the bottom of the bearing. After the bolt has made
contact with the crank the triangular arrangement as
a unit slides to the rear. At this point, however, for a
small rearward movement of the bolt, the buffer fol-
lower must travel a much greater distance up the cam
surface than before, and at the same time greatly com-
press the closing spring. This final operation cushions
the impact of the moving parts as they are brought to
rest.
While the inertia of the moving parts has completed
the opening of the bolt after the power stroke, it has
also stored sufficient energy in the closing spring to
force the bolt into its original position. The operation,
though reversed, is identical to that of opening with
the exception of the results accomplished. When
moving to the rear, extraction, cocking, and ejection oc-

forced from the magazine into the chamber and the
piece is locked. A lip on the lower portion of the bolt
strikes the upper base of the top cartridge in the maga-
zine and, by means of suitable guides forces it into the
chamber.
The cycle is now complete. Extraction, cocking,
ejection, and locking have occurred. Although the
locking is not positive and liable to be overlooked, it
has been accomplished by again reducing the eccentricity
of the toggle to its original proportions.
Following a constant tendency found in the develop-
ment of military rifles toward smaller bore diameters,
the Pedersen is caliber .276. This decrease of .024
inches below the .30 inch diameter of the Springfield
is accompanied by several advantageous characteristics.
The cartridges used in the Pedersen are lighter and
more compact than those used in the Springfield. This
has been accomplished by reducing the weight of the
powder charge as well as the projectile. A man is able
to carry one third more ammunition for the Pedersen
than he can for the Springfield. Also, some weight
has been removed from the barrel because the reduced
powder charge produces a lower chamber pressure.
Some difficulty, however, is encountered in using this
small caliber projectile. All machine guns at the pres-
ent time fire .30 caliber ammunition which is inter-
changeable with that used in the Springfield rifle. If
the machine guns are not redesigned to handle Peeler-
sen ammunition, should this weapon l&gt;e accepted, it
will be impossible for infantry companies to rely upon
machine gun units for reserve ammunition.
To insure positive operation of the Pedersen, it is
necessary to coat the cartridges with a wax-like lubri-
cant. Springfield ammunition is not oiled, for the fric-
tion between the surfaces of the cartridge case and the
chamber assist in reducing the force action on the bolt.
A different condition exists in the Pedersen, however,
for during the period of high gas pressure the breech
closure completes the power stroke. It moves a suf-
ficient distance to the rear to cause failure of the cart-
ridge case if it were held stationary. Obviously, then,
the friction between the case and the chamber must be
low enough to permit the cartridge case to follow the
boh.
The lubricant applied not only reduces the frictional

A well-lighted modern foundry.
WHILR it has long been realized that a large
proportion of the faulty castings made in a
foundry have been made so by improper con-
ditions in the sand, it has only been in recent years
that much attention has been paid to the remedying of
this condition. It also appears that a full study of
sands has never yet been made.
This paper is a review of the present knowledge of
the properties of molding sands and shows the favor-
able way in which these properties may be changed by
the addition of soluble electrolytes.
The properties of natural and electrolyte-treated
sands considered are: first, those which cannot be con-
trolled because they are inherent, namely; refractori-
ness, destructibility, and fineness; second, permeability,
and third cohesiveness,—both properties that can be
controlled to some extent.
Three properties of molding sand may be considered
together since they are alike in one respect. Refractori-
ness, destructibility, and fineness, are essentially prop-
erties of the material as it is taken from the ground
because none of the present methods of preparing the
sand for use change these properties appreciably.
One of the first requirements of a sand for molding
is that it be able to stand the temperature of the molten
metal without fusion. If the mold should soften and
melt, not only would the shape of the resulting casting
be inaccurate but its surface would be covered with a
firmly adhering coating of sand. The high tempera-
tures involved also require that the sand possess refrac-
tory qualities for if it does not, it cannot be used re-
peatedly.
When the particles of sand fuse or bake together,
they lose their original bonding properties, and hence
their value in a molding sand is reduced or destroyed.
The refractoriness of sand can be traced to its miner-
al constituents. While sands high in quartz content are
resistant to heat, ordinary sands fuse more readily due
to their content of feldspar and mica. The kaolinite.
which is the main constituent of clay and one of the
principal hording materials of molding sand, will lose

Molding Sand
By Allison B. Evans, '32E
its usefulness if the proportion of fluxing constituents
is too high and if the material is heated too hot by the
molten metal.
Although in considering any addition to molding
sands refractoriness must be taken into account, a dif-
ficulty occurs in that most of the suitable electrolytes
have low fusion points. I fowever, one like ammonium
nitrate might be chosen since it decomposes into gaseous
products. Actual foundry testing of the sand would
be necessary to see if a prepared sand were sufficiently
refractory.
Somewhat related to refractoriness is destructibility.
.After the metal solidifies in a mold it contracts, which
makes it necessary for the mold to break and allow the
casting to continue to contract until it reaches room
temperature. If the mold should fuse together, or
become solid under the influence of the heat, the shape
of the piece being molded might be distorted when
finally cool, and the work required to clean the casting
would, in some cases, be much increased.
Natural molding sands meet this requirement satis-
factorily. With treated sand it is expected that little
difficulty will be had in this respect unless the electro-
lyte added is too fusible.
The fineness of molding sand is more typical of this
group of properties than refractoriness or destructibil-
ity. It is neither changed by any of the present meth-
ods of preparing sands, nor is it affected by any of the
treatments being considered, yet it is one of the prop-
erties of which the foundry man thinks first when se-
lecting a sand.
The size of the grains used determines the finish of
the casting. Large grains result in rough castings due
to the tendency of the metal to force itself between the
sand particles. While the same influence is exerted with
finer grained sand, the result is less noticeable because
the depressions and elevations are on a much smaller
scale.
With ferrous metals, a sand chosen to give the proper
surface to the casting will not let the iron penetrate into

Mistakes
By Professor Walter C. Sadler
THE remedy for a contractuall mistake is granted
by a Court of Equity in contrast to a Court of
Law. The Court of Law, in general, can only
consider the performance or breach of a contract, while
a Court of Equity is not restricted by formal require-
ments but can go behind a contract and look to the true
intent of the parties. The remedy at equity may either
be a reformation of the contract or a complete rescis-
sion of it.
Mistakes in contract relationships may arise in two
ways. The actual wording of the contract may not
state the obligation in just the way the parties intended.
Thus, in placing a bid for a piece of construction, a mis-
take is made in the amount by the contractor but with-
out negligence on his part. Equity may grant relief if
the error is excessive, and provided further that the
relief will not subject other persons to any substantial
loss. Again, the parties may intent the obligation as set
forth in the contract, but not fully realize the results
of this obligation due to unknown consequences. Such
an example may be found where a beneficiary turns in
an insurance policy for its cash surrender value, both
parties believing the insured to be alive, while in reality
he is dead.
Mistakes of Law and Fact
A mistake of law occurs where an error is made as
to the legal consequences of an act. There is a con-
flict of authority as to whether equitable relief will be
given in this type of case. Those courts which deny
relief apparently ignore the resulting injustice to the
parties and base their decision solely ulx&gt;n the old max-
im "Ignorance of the law excuses none."
A mutual mistake of fact may occur where there is
an error in the description of property, but lx&gt;th parties
have in mind the same identical piece of land. Equity
will grant a reformation of such deed on the basis that
the party benefiting by the mistake is in reality holding
the excess land in trust for the other party. This is
true where the land is larger or smaller than spec! lied
in the deed. However, if the purchaser of the land,
and particularly if he be a subsequent purchaser for
value, secured his interest in the land relying solely
on the description in the deed, he would secure such
interest as the deed conveys inasmuch as he is entirely
innocent of any mistake.
The price of land may be determined by the value
of the land as an entire track, or by the value of the
land based upon a definite price per acre, depending on

School. Soon this
building will no

ments.

the contract of the parties. If there is a mistaken idea
as to the size of the land in the first case, equity will
offer no relief. In the second case, however, if the
land contains a number of acres different than that
forming the basis of the transaction, equity can grant
a complete rescission of the contract or reform it so
that the price will be adjusted to take care of the true
area of the land, provided such reformation is not so
complete as to amount to the making of a new con-
tract.
A mistake of fact may occur where one party only
makes the mistake, the other party being entirely ig-
norant that any mistake is being made. Equity, in gen-
eral, will not grant relief in this case. To obtain relief
from a unilateral mistake it must be shown to have
been induced by the conduct of the opposite party.

Negligence in discovering a mistake does not usually
bar a recovery. It appears to be so even whether the
plaintiff has gone a period of many years before dis-
covering.
Parole Evidence Knlc
The parole evidence rule restricts the evidence which
may be introduced at a suit involving a written docu-
ment. This rule specifies that no oral testimony is ad-
missible to alter or vary the terms of a written instru-
ment, although such evidence may be admitted to ex-
plain it. The problem arises where we have a written
instrument containing a mistake which it is desired to
alter through the assistance of parole evidence by ox-
plaining the true intent of the parties. While a court
of law would absolutely prohibit the introduction of
such evidence, the courts of equity will admit the parole
evidence to establish the mistake. It has already been
noted in the matter of a conveyance of an interest in
property that a court of equity will permit the admission
of oral evidence to show that a sealed deed has been

College Notes
Paul A. Rauff
TO familiarize those certain few who never heard
of Paul A. "Whitey" Rauff, we beg of them to
fix their glances at the picture above and study
his becoming features. That Whitey is quite a ladies
man is proved beyond all doubts when one glances
over his collection of "passing and dead fancies" which
he has framed and has hanging on the walls of his
room. But Whitey is an honorable man. and above all,
a gentleman and a scholar.
Whitey, aside from his good looks, has numerous
other assets. His capabilities as a leader won him
campus distinction early in his school career not only
in the Engineering school but on the other side of the
campus as well. A likable young man, he never en-
counters trouble in putting things across.
Delving into chronology, the fall of 1928 saw Whit-
ey suddenly leave Buffalo, N.Y., his bosom town and
come to .Michigan, a center of culture and education
where he immediately began to expound his long re-
strained original theories on the design of safer bridges
and tunnels between Canada and U.S. But to become
a mere bookworm was not his only inspiration, as was
soon evident when he joined the Scalp and Blade social
fraternity and became a member of the Triangle fra-
ternity that same year. That year, too, saw him in
the role of Lieutenant of the Freshman games. This
rank of the Lieutenant he retained during the annual
class games that came to pass in his time. His unoffi-
cial rank during the games being that of a scrub painter
and artist.
Sophomore year found Whitey giving thought to
campus politics. His personality, reliability, integrity
and keen judgment made him a much sought man. The
election to the Engineering Honor Committee marks
the beginning of his march towards campus distinction.
Belonging to the group of active men that apply them-
selves for the welfare of their fellow students he soon
won recognition for his earnest endeavors and an invi-
tation from Triangles was his reward.
His election to the chairmanship of the Engineering
Honor Committee in his third year stamped him as one
of the outstanding men in the engineering college. The
boys, of his house, sensing his abilities elected him
house manager that year. When the time for election of
class president rolled around Whitey by virtue of his
past performances was in order for candidacy. After a
discouraging take-off in his campaign Whitey just
bunched his efforts together one Sunday and Monday
night, and Tuesday night after all the flurry and
clouds of war hath passeth away, our Whitey was de-
clared the victor by a mere five votes. This simultane-
ously gave him a seat in the Engineering Student Coun-
cil. He also served on the J-Hop floor committee and
Slide Rule ticket committee that year.
We will never forget the time he was called upon
to referee a boxing bout between Harvey Bauss and
Gus Trometer (another couple of Buffalo boys) at the
Engineering Council Smoker. The argument between
the boys was getting pretty well heated and in steps
Whitey. Well, just then Harvey uncorks one of his
sizzling pile-driving wallops, misses Gus and slams
right into Whitey. After Whitey came to the bout was
resumed.
And even now with his fourth year hardly under
way he has already been made president of the A.S.C.E.
and in this capacity is certainly living up to his repu-
tation. Just the other day, he received the manager-
ship of this years Wrestling team which also makes him
a meml&gt;er of the "M'' club.
When the end of this year rolls around and the in-
evitable graduation takes him away from us. we are
going to miss Whitey—miss him a lot is our prophecy.
A. I. E. E.
The first meeting of the student branch of A. 1. E. E.
was recently held in the West Engineering building.
Professor Atwood of the electrical department, branch
counselor presided. The professor opened the meet-
ing presenting a brief history of the organization, its
purpose, activities and in conclusion pointed out some
plans set for the coming year.
From the plans laid forth, it is readily seen that the
branch will offer many favorable and valuable opportuni-
ties to its members. Mainly through the efforts of Pro-
fessor A. D. Moore a series of contact programs are
being arranged through which students may become ac-
quainted with prominent men in the electrical field.
These programs are intended to present men from De-
troit Edison, Michigan Bell. General Electric, and
Westinghouse companies, who shall discuss technical
problems of the day. The first contact program is
slated for December twelfth, at which time Mr. M.

IT IS our desire each month to bring to your atten-
tion some alumnus who has risen to the heights in
his particular field. The number of alumni who
remember the names of their classmates is pitifully
small. Then there are others who, in the rush of a
work-a-day life, have little opportunity to keep track
of their school friends unless a direct business con-
tact makes it inevitable. In spite of their inability to
keep in actual contact with their fellow alumni, they
are always anxious to hear the news about some long
forgotten friend. Without a doubt, a number of alum-
ni have read about a classmate in the daily paper and
never recognized his name. In a number of cases, the
name in print stimulates merely a sort of conditioned
reflex,—but in an equally great number of cases it
provides an incentive to find if his "hunch" about this
fellow is true,—to find out if he was really the one
you sat next to in your freshman "analyt" class. The
best place to confirm your notion is to turn to the
Alumni Notes section of the "Technic" and a great
percentage of the time you'll find his name in print.
Well friends, this month we are going to present to
you an alumnus of the University, who needs little
introduction in his home city. However his name will
call into action your powers of memory a little more
than usual for those of you who are not residents of
the city of Detroit. The name of George Harrison
Fenkell has been brought to our attention as one of
those who we think deserving of being recalled to your
memory.
But before we tell you why a story of Mr. Fenkell
would please you, perhaps it would be interesting and
desirable for all of you to know a little more about
him. We should go back to the cold winter morning in
1873 when Mr. Fenkell was born. It was on February
4th of this year that Mr. Delaville Fenkell and his
wife, Mrs. Sarah Fenkell announced to the small town
of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, the birth of their son. It was
in this small town that Mr. Fenkell studied his three
"R's" and received his high school education. A little
later, Mr. Fenkell chose for his higher education, the
University of Michigan. His main ambition was to
become a Civil Engineer. So in 1891, he entered the
Civil Engineering department of the University as a
freshman. His stay here was for the period of a year.
It is obvious that during this year he was given only
a small idea of what the engineering field is like and at
the same time provided him with the fundamentals
that are necessary, scholastically speaking, for en-

George Harrison Fenkell
gineering. The remarkable part of Mr. Fenkell's story
is that training in other engineering qualities seemed to
be unnecessary,—the qualities of initiative and con-
structive ability. Whether these were inherent or gained
through practical experience is of little consequence
but the success of his career as an engineer proves
definitely that they were there.
1897 proved to be another important date in the
life of Mr. Fenkell for it was on the 22nd of Febru-
ary in this year he was married to Miss Jeanie Harris
of Rocky River, Ohio, who became the mother of his
son, Neal Harrison and later of his daughter. Margaret
Susan. Five years later he took a job as Civil Engineer
with the Comissioners of Water Works in Erie, Penn-
sylvania. This same state made him the Pennsylvania
Dock Commissioner in 1908. The same year saw him
in Detroit as an engineer in the Department of Water
Works.
He worked industriously at his job until 1913 when
notice was taken of his merit. At this time he became
the Commissioner of Public Works. Steady advance-
ment placed him at the desk of General Manager of
the Department of Water Supply in 1918. In 1924
he became Superintendent and General Manager of the
Board of Water Commissioners, the position that he
now holds.
Mr. Fenkell's history also brings to light the fact
that he is a Lieutenant Colonel in the Officer's Reserve
Corps. He served as president of the Michigan En-
gineering Society and the Detroit Engineering Societv.
He is also a member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers the American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers and the American Waterworks Association.
In 1902 the American Society of Civil Engineers pre-
sented him with the much cherished Norman Medal.
In 1926 the University of Michigan thought it fit-
ting to give him a degree in Engineering and confer-
red upon him a B.S. This was not an honorary de-
gree. It was given him for excellence in the work
which he had once started in the University and was
conferred as the class of 1895.
Mr. Fenkell now resides at 8100 Jefferson Avenue
in Detroit. In his home city he is very active in the

ona is
Tau Beta Pi
It is certainly not unreasonable to say that every
Engineer strives to make Tau Beta Pi during his life
on the campus of any one of our larger Universities
or Colleges. It is acknowledged the premier of all
technical honor societies, the ultimate in the budding
career of the embryo artisan of industry, and a badge
of accomplishment to be worn with the utmost pride
and distinction. There are large chapters all over the
United States in every large Engineering College of
repute. Its members are numbered by the thousand
and include hundreds of the captains of modern in-
dustry. The society has truly made a record of whole-
hearted success and achievement in fostering good
scholarship and good fellowship among undergraduate
engineers.
As the ideal toward which every freshman engineer
should build his college life and the beacon which
points the way to service to humanity, the prime aim
of the engineering profession, the Technic feels that
Tau Beta Pi ought to have the honor of being first in
this series of presentations to the undergraduate stu-
dent. Read this account over, then, all you who pro-
fess to have ambition, work hard and conscientiously,
stoop not, develop the strong characteristics of the
worthwhile engineer, and you'll join the fellowship of
Tau Beta Pi.
The Michigan Gamma chapter of the national organ-
ization of Tau Beta Pi, founded in 1906, was one of
the earliest of these groups formed and has always en-
joyed one of the best reputations in the entire society.
Strict adherence to the ideals of good scholarship, good
fellowship, and good character has always been the
prime motive of its existence and the force behind its
every activity. Elections are held twice a year in
strictly confidential and closed meetings. Candidates
are brought before the group and freely discussed as
to whether or not they come up to the fullest extent of
these ideals. The foremost requisite is the highest
type of scholarship, no man being brought up for con-
sideration without this point absolutely in his favor as
shown by the College record cards. The requirements of
good character and social prominence is a matter for the
group elections to decide. ()nly those whose scholastic
rating is the best and who meet the rigid limits of the
members on these other points are invited to join.
Students are eligible during both their junior and
senior years and have a chance of making the grade
at any one of four possible elections.
Tau Beta Pi is not strictly an activity in the true
sense of the word. Though it backs everything that
stands for the betterment of any phase of life m the
Engineering College it takes very little active leader-
ship in carrying such things out. But that, of course,
is not its primary function so it leaves such things to
the other more applicable groups. Meetings are held
at the Union, every two weeks, at which dinner is
served and a good speaker secured to address the mem-
bers. Open discussion is always in order, and the
group is welded into one solid unit dedicated to the
furtherance of everything that advances its ideals of
true engineering leadership.
Open Book Exams
Why should a Junior or Senior Engineering Student
be called upon to write a closed book examination?
Why should he be asked to memorize a mass of end-
less detail which will be of practically no benefit to
him when he enters the profession? Finally, when
"on the job" and confronted with an unusual prob-
lem, will he screw his memory to the breaking point
in order to remember how he solved the problem in
school, or will he refer to a text lxxik, which is not only
quicker but far more accurate than his memory.
For underclassmen, we grant that a closed book ex-
amination has some virtues. Many of the basic prin-
ciples of mathematics and physics must be thorougbly
mastered and memorized. On the other hand we won-
der how many Juniors and Seniors (outside of Chemi-
cal Engineers) could pass a final examination in Fresh-
man chemistry with no preparation? How many upper
classmen could take a final in Descriptive Geometry
and make a passing grade without previous prepara-
tion? Those who could, would be few and far be-
tween.
The purpose of an engineering education is not to
make the young engineer a walking bundle of
axioms and memorized knowledge but to produce a
man who can lay his hands on any information and facts
whenever he desires to do so. As we see it, there is
no disgrace in referring to a book when presented with
a problem to solve. Of course, times will come when
books are not handy but in the ordinary run of pro-
fessional life, this happens very seldom. A general
knowledge of a subject and the ability to quickly find
accurate details should comprise an engineer's equip-
ment. Is the fact that an upper classman or a practic-
ing engineer cannot pass an examination in a Freshman
subject, an indication that the time he spent on it is
wasted? No! Having completed a course in the sub-
ject, he has the general knowledge and can immedinte-
Iv find anv information on the details.

upper classman an examination in mathematics
or physics, or a Chemical Engineer an examina-
tion in Freshman Chemistry, because we believe
he could pass them. Why? Because he uses
them every day in his upper class work. So,
too. will he use some of his knowledge in his
professional work after graduation. So. too,
will this knowledge become a part of him and
he will not have to refer to text bo ,ks for prob-
lems which come up day after da-- However,
this last step should take place it. the profes-
sion and not in college. Why should an Elec-
trical Engineer master by memory the details
of power plant design when he I&gt;ecomes a vacu-
um tube devotee after graduation ? Why should
a Civil Engineer master by memory the in-
tricacies of a compound wound motor?
Why a closed book exam? Many open book Exami-
nations are now given in the Engineering College and
those who come into contact with them must admit that
they are more comprehensive than the closed book
type. They tax the ingenuity but do not strain the
memory. What is your opinion? We invite com-
ments, both "pro and con", from both professors and
students.

A Thoughtful Boost
The staff of the Technic has this month what amounts
to a sort of public duty to perform in favor of the
various campus fraternities who have been recently
added to the subscription files. A certain well known
alumnus of the college who absolutely refuses to take
the credit due him and even goes so far as to request
the veil of anonymity, upon discovering what has lieen
very well known here at the office for some time, took
pains to see that the evil was corrected to the mutual
benefit of lxith parties. We refer, rather significantly,
to the fact that the student subscription files show a
very much greater percentage of the total possible sub-
scribers among independents than it does among the
fraternity men. This mystery has always been more
or less unexplainable although there must be a reason
for it. But it's off the books now. From this issue on
all fraternity men will read the Technic through the
courtesy of a real booster of the publication.
Every house on the campus is to be provided with
copies of the magazine from this issue until May '33
comes off the press, gratis. The only thing asked of
the various house-managers is that they be sure the
copies do not disappear from the library tables where
every engineer can get a good chance to read them.
And it would be well to see that they finally gravitate
to the fraternity files for future reference.
We take this opportunity to thank the friend of the
engineering fraternities for the houses who are to
benefit through his kindness.

Ann Arbor as a Cultural Center
Last month these columns called attention to an ap-
parent divergence of opinion between to great educators
on the old problem of cultural values. We venture the
claim, however, that if lx&gt;th were in Ann Arbor on
the proper evening, they could be found in Hill Audi-
torium simultaneously enjoying one of the excellent
numbers on our Oratorical Association Lecture Course
or in our Choral L'nion Concert Series. Perhaps Presi-
dent Compton would explain that he was relaxing from
an intense cultural contact with a wheelbarrow, while
our own Dean Emeritus Cooley might say that he was
absorbing culture as "a participating member of so-
ciety". Both of these eminent gentlemen would be right
and each of them would be successful in his quest as a
glance at the programs of these beautiful events will
prove. From Budapest, from far Odessa, from Nor-
way, and from thrilling Tibet, the artists come to lay
their offerings on the altars of Ann Arbor. Not least
among them shine our own stars from New York, from
Boston and Detroit. Only by a cooperative community
effort through local organizations can we thus bring the
world to our door. Both the Oratorical Association
and the Choral Union are to be congratulated on the
inspiring array of superlatively great artists who will
be brought to our cultural center this season.
These two agencies for over half a century have
furnished the richest cultural features of our campus
life. As we look back over our university days, the
outstanding experiences are nearly always those occa-
sions on which we have had contact with great person-
alities. To have spent an hour or two in the company
of a Paderewski, a William Butler Yeats, a Lawrence
Tibbet. or a Lowell Thomas is to have extended one's
intellectual and emotional frontier. No disembodied
voices these, imprisoned in some raucous radio, but liv-
ing, vibrant personalities whose magnetic presence cre-
ates fields of influence that abide. For the busy pro-
fessional student who has no time to waste on the cheap
amusements of our day, the lectures and concerts offer
the verv best investment of his time and monev.

Gyroscopes for Ocean Liners
Although gyro-stabilizers have been used for many
years in counteracting the disturbing forces of waves
on warships and yachts, they have never been applied
to giant ocean liners. However, the Conti de Saroia.
second largest Italian liner, which is now in the process
of construction, will be equipped with three giant gyro-
scopes, and will be the first ocean liner to be so equipped.
The vast and immensely powerful impulses of
enormous ocean waves against the sides of these large
steam liners have created problems in marine engineer-
ing research for many years and have never really
been solved in the past by the types of stabilizers used.
Although the ship has a displacement of 48.000
tons, the three rotors will keep it effectively stabilized.
The rotor of each gyro-stabilizer is thirteen feet in
diameter and weighs one hundred tons. These larger
gyroscopes are controlled by a small, sensitive pilot
gyroscope which, detecting the first keeling impulse of
a wave, acts on the larger _
gyroscopes through relays
and a geared precession
motor, causing them to be-
gin tilting in a fore and aft
direction from the verti-
cal. According to the
laws of mechanics, the
gyro-stabilizers are thus
caused to exert a torque
around the long axis of
the ship in such a way as
to counteract the effect of
the wave.
Automobile Production
Automobile and truck production have suffered a
51 per cent decrease between 1929 and 1931. although
the number of motor vehicles on the streets today shows
no such percentage of decrease. During the past three
years a deficit of some 5,750,000 motor vehicle units
has accumulated. The apparent conclusion is that auto-
mobiles are being used more intensively and that many
of them are obsolete. This conclusion is substantiated
by the fact that the consumption of gasoline has in-
creased 15 per cent during the same period, which
would indicate that present day vehicles are operating
at a lower efficiency than formerly. It is believed that
when trade comes back, many old automobiles, which
are now practically wrecks, will be rapidly replaced.
New Development in Autogyro
Embodying the most recent refinements of luxury
and comfort to be found in most commercial passenger


planes, a new enclosed cabin Autogiro to be of-
fered commercially by Pitcairn Aircraft Co., defi-
nitely marks a step toward the ultimate in air trans-
port. The ship provides seating room for five
people to ride in comfort and is readily converted
into a six passenger by making over the spacious
baggage compartments.
Designated as a brand new model, the plane has
a useful load of 1360 pounds, plus a reserve for
optional equipment such as a Townend Ring or
wheel fairings of 60 pounds each. The gross
weight runs close to 4,000 Ibs. Overall length of
the machine measures 38 feet, wing span 30 feet.

rotor squared around, the ship fits into a hangar of 37
feet in width by 39l/2 feet in depth, leaving a clearance
of nine inches all around.
Mercury Walls Increase Capacity
In tests made recently, it has been found that the
thermal efficiency of the mercury binary cycle is good,
averaging around 35 per cent when utilizing the steam
output of the condenser boiler in a 35,000 kilowatt
steam turbine at 250 pounds gage, 700 degrees Fahren-
heit. One kilowatt-hour has been delivered at the
switchboard for 9930 B.T.U. in the fuel. Actual oper-
ating costs showed a fuel rate of 10250 B.T.U. per
kilowatt-hour.
Two 20,000 kilowatt plants are in the process of
construction at the General Electric Company plant.
These units will be installed in approximately the same
space as the 10,000 kilowatt Hartford unit, the in-
creased rating being made possible by mercury walls
installed in the upper half of the furnace and water
walls in the lower half. The mercury pressure has also
been increased from 70 to 125 pounds gage. Each
plant generates 325,000 pounds of steam each hour.
Carbonic Acid Gas from Fermentation
In the process of fermentation in breweries and dis-
tilleries, sugar is split into nearly equal parts of alcohol
and carbon dioxide. Since the gas thus produced is
free from any secondary gas, it may be collected for
use in many industrial operations and for other pur-
poses.
The carbon dioxide must first be purged of the
fermentation odor which would be detrimental to the
process if the gas were liquefied and used as dry ice.
This cleaning is done at a pressure of about four at-
mospheres in cleaning cylinders filled with calcium chlo-
ride, sulphuric acid, oil, charcoal, and other ingredients.
Dry ice, or solid carbon dioxide, as a commercial
article was first manufactured in the L'nited States, but
its production has since extended throughout the world.
After the gas has been cleaned, it is liquefied by a
two-stage compressor using water cooling. The liquid
is turned to snow'by allowing it to expand and evapo-
rate. From this snow, dry ice is formed by means of
hydraulic presses.
Dry ice has many advantages over water ice. includ-
ing greater cold capacity for a given volume, longer
operation per loading, and decreased humidity due to
evaporation of the refrigerant.
Carlx&gt; n dioxide has also many chemical uses. If
beer ever comes back to the United States, a large and
cheap supply of by-product carbon dioxide will be avail-
able for many uses.
Tests on Self-Cooled Turbo
The largest self-cooled turbo-alternator ever to be
built has been completed and is now undergoing many

A 100,000 KVA self cooled turbo-alternator
unusual tests. It was constructed for the Public
Service of New Jersey and is rated 100.000 kva., 13.8
kv., at 1800 rpm.
Among the many tests given it. is that in which stray
load losses are found. These losses are measured di-
rectly for lxath magnitude and distribution. This is
done by measuring the rate of temperature rise when
the load is suddenly increased. Knowing this rate of
temperature rise and the specific heat of the material,
at various points in the machine, it is possible to calcu-
late the "watts per pound" loss, since for some time
after the increase in load, the rate of heat dissipation
remains practically constant.
Air Conditioning on Railways
Ten diners equipped with the latest type railway air
conditioning and cooling systems will be placed in
operation in the near future by the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railroad in their trans-continental trains
running through the West and Southwest.
The Santa Fe will be the first railroad to use the
new Carrier air conditioning system, which employs
steam from the engine as the refrigerating energy and
water as the sole refrigerating medium, thereby elimi-
nating gaseous refrigerants. Railroad executives and
engineers, representing the major roads of the country,
who witnessed the initial demonstration of the system
at the Corner Research Laboratories recently, voiced
the belief that it foreshadowed general application of
air conditioning on American railroads.
The new cooling system will maintain a temperature
not to exceed 80 degrees with a relative humidity of
50 per cent, when the outside temperature is 100 de-
grees. The temperature inside the car will thus be
lowered twenty degrees under extreme conditions, with
corresponding moderation in the relative humidity.
In cold weather, the air conditioning system sup-
plements the usual steam heating, and provides for cir-
culation of the air which had not previously been
practical.
The trend toward air conditioning on railways is
seen as a move by the railroads to improve their com-
petitive position with respect to bus and private car
travel. They anticipate that the comfort of cooled cars
in summer will attract customers to railways just as the
air conditioning of theaters enables them to overcome
the usual summer box office slump.

He never flirts, he shuns the skirts, and walks the nar-
row path
And be the weather fair or rain he takes his weekly
bath
He's fond of bridge or solitare and poker tempts him
not,
He likes to dine but not on wine, (they say his lips
are hot).
He's fond of Kipling, Poe and Keats but Balzac, knocks
him cold
He reads the best and leaves the rest until he's pret-
ty old
He likes to play around the house and never stays out
late.
He seldom smokes the vicious weed or talks without

He never snores or puts his feet on the mantlepiece.
From day to day and year to year his virtues never
cease,
So if you think you should wed just pick the engineer.

A blond flapper called at the hospital the day after
the accident.
"I want to see the young man who was injured in
the auto wreck last night."
"Are you the girl that was with him?" asked the
nurse.
"Yes," was the reply, "and I thought it was only
right to come and give him the kiss he was trying for."
It was customary for the congregation to repeat the
23rd Psalm in unison, but invariably Mrs. Spiel fast
would keep about a dozen words ahead all the rest.

Sunday, "was the lady who was already by the still
waters while the rest of us were lying down in green
pastures?"

A wealthy auto tourist lost his pedigreed dog while
stopping in a small town. He inserted a lost ad in the
local paper offering a reward of $100.
The next day he went to the office to inquire, but no
one was to be found except a decrepit janitor.
"Where in thunder is the newspaper force?'' asked
the tourist impatiently.
"They're all out," the old man replied "trying to find
your dog."

force, but it acts as a medium to prevent season crack-
ing in the brass case. It does not have the greasy qual-
ities associated with other types of cartridge lubricants,
for it may be applied in a film sufficiently thin to pre-
vent the adhesion of dirt or gritty material.
At mid-ranges an average marksman can fire from
30 to 35 aimed shots a minute with the Pedcrsen. Un-
der the same conditions, the Springfield will deliver
but 10 to 15 shots per minute. This increase in the
effective rate of fire is made possible largely by the
operation of the breech mechanism. Other features
have been incorporated in the Pedersen to reduce the
number of operations required to deliver each shot.
In the first place, the Pedersen's magazine holds ten
cartridges, or twice as many as may l&gt;e stored in the
Springfield. Hence the time lost in refilling magazines
relative to the number of shots fired is decreased. Sec-
ondly, the breech closure is so constructed that it re-
mains open after the last cartridge in the magazine has
been fired, blocking the operator's line of sight, and
immediately notifying him to the fact that the weapon
is empty. And thirdly, the breech, functioning en-
tirely from the energy of the powder charge, requires
no attention from the operator. He is able to keep the
target in view at all time with the exception of that
interval occupied in refilling the magazine.
Developing as a result of a logical demand for a suc-
cessful rapid-fire rifle, the Pederson is quite satisfac-
tory. The unique application of the blow-back princi-
ple, keeping the weight within the allowable limits,
marks this weapon as a very progressive step in the
improvement of small arms. Possibly the most out-
standing disadvantage of the Pedersen rests in the fact
that its ammunition is not interchangeable with that
for the machine gun. However, the Pedersen cart-
ridges are lighter and more compact, and they are bet-
ter adapted to the infantry, the type of service for
which the Pedersen is designed.
THE PROPERTIES OF MOLDING SAND
(Continued from page 8)
the sand. When non-ferrous metals are cast, this may
or may not be true. It may be necessary to select a
much finer sand, one which will keep all the metal
within the confines of the mold.
Following the properties which can not be controlled,
come those with which this is possible. Each is im-
portant enough to be treated at length. These prop-
erties are permeability and cohesiveness.
Permeability is that property of molding sand which
permits gases to pass through the sand as they leave the
mold, thus making room for the metal to fill complete-
ly the whole of the space in the mold. This is one of
the properties which is regulated in every foundry ac-
cording to the molder's judgement. Control used to
be obtained more or less instinctively but now it is
accomplished by permeability of sands.
Some of the properties of molding sands are such
that the present methods of control have no effect on
the permeability of the sand. The size of the grains
has a marked effect which varies with both their coarse-
ness and their uniformity. The coarser the sand, the
more free space exists between the sand particles, and
the less impeded is the path of the gases as they pass
through these spaces, resulting in higher permeability.
Large castings require the use of coarse grained sand
because such a sand is sufficiently permeable to permit
the rapid escape of gases.
Not only the coarseness, but the uniformity of grain
size has also an effect on this ability of the sand to
pass gas. The more variation there is in particle size,
the more closely may the grains be packed togther,
which means that there will be less free space for the
gas to pass through and that this space will be more ob-
structed. The result is decreased permeability.
The shape of the grains produces analogous results.
Angular grains when packed together fill the space
more completely than the round tyl&gt;e of grains, and
add more friction to the flow in those spaces which are
left. Both effects tend to reduce permeability. For
maximum permeability with a certain grain size, the
grains should be round.
Since the minerals of sand are relatively inert, there
will be no change either in the size or shape of the
sand particles on the addition of most electrolytes.
In any sand, the coarseness and uniformity of the
grain sizes, as well as the shape, are fully determined,
but it is common practice to vary the permeability by
additions of water. Although dry molding sand has a
low permeability, it is possible to increase it by adding
and mixing in of water up to the definite amount which
gives maximum permeability.
This effect is explained much as grain coarseness is
explained. The water coats the individual particles
and forces them apart due to both the thickness of the
film produced, and the hydration of surface colloids
which causes swelling. The result is an increase in the
amount of free space and a greater ease of passing
gas so that the permeability increases. When the water
content is so high that the films become too thick and
overlap, the amount of free space is cut down and the
permeability is reduced.
The use of water to increase the permeability of
molding sand is not entirely satisfactory. In the first
place, as the hot metal enters the mold, it beats the
sand causing a rapid evolution of water vapor. This
water vapor, as well as the air which originally filled
the mold, must be forced out through the sand if the
casting is to be completed and without flaws. The
valxirization of water requires heat, and takes this
heat at a temperature no higher than its boiling point
so that there is a chilling effect on the metal when cast.
This effect is especially bad when gray iron castings

iron white, instead of gray.
Both of these detrimental effects hecome more in-
jurious as the water content of the sand increases.
Since it has been found that molding sands contain col-
loids, and since it is known that the swelling of some
colloids can be regulated by the control of the acidity
and electrolyte concentration of the liquid wetting
those colloids, it seems as though some such control
might lead to the increase of permeability of molding
sands with smaller additions of water. This would tend
to reduce the harmful effect of water on the mold and
on the casting.
The other property of molding sand which, at pres-
ent, is controlled to some extent is adhesiveness. Ad-
hesiveness is that property of molding sand which
causes the grains to stick together and retain their posi-
tion. Regulation here has been found just as useful
as in the case of permeability. Adhesiveness is much
more important than the non-changeable properties, for,
while the latter may influence some particular detail,
adhesiveness determines whether the mold can be made
to retain its shape.
The same characteristics of the sand grains which
produced lower permeability, produce higher adhesive-
ness, if this quality is measured by the compression
test which is recommended by the American Foundry-
men's Association for this measurement. The finer the
sand, the greater the cohesiveness because, while the
force per unit area of contact between grains may be
the same, the actual area of contact of a fine sand is
much larger than that for a coarse sand. The same
theory shows that because the more nearly uniformly-
sized sands have a smaller area of contact than the
non-uniformly-sized sands, they will have less adhesive-
ness. When grain shape is considered, it may be shown
by following the same reasoning that angular grains
possess more adhesiveness than rounded grains.
Since the clay bonding material of any sand is a
constant of the sand, it may be classified with the dis-
cussion of the effect of size and shape of the grains
which are also constants of sand. The properties of the
clay are, however greatly varied by the amount of
water present. Just as the permeability of molding
sand increases to a maximum and then decreases as the
water concentration increases, adhesiveness at first
grows and later dwindles as more water is added. The
maximum permeability and cohesiveness may occur
with the same amount of water, or, either may become
a maximum first, depending upon the particular sand
used. It is desirable to have both developed to a maxi-
mum at the same water concentration which itself
should be as low as possible.
Now that it has been shown how water effects the
cohesiveness of clay, it may be well to attempt an ex-
planation. While the theories have not been well
enough worked out so that any one is generally ac-
cepted, the following one sounds quite plausible. Dried

clay is quite dusty and powdery if crushed. On addi-
tion of water, little balls form where the water holds
the grains together, probably due at first to surface
tension effects, and later as the sand is mixed its grains
become uniformly wet, and when the mixture is aged
long enough, the full bonding properties are developed
as the clay substance becomes fully hydrated with what
water is present. Since this hydrate is sticky, it holds
the sand grains together and results in a cohesiveness
greater than that of dry sand, but not as great as it
would have been had a little more water been added,
that is, enough more to fully develop the stickiness of
the clay. Still greater addition of water causes the loss
of the stickiness and of the viscosity of the clay, which,
in turn, results in a reduction of the strength developed
with less water.
A number of authorities on clay and colloids suggest
methods of controlling the adhesiveness of molding
sands. L,y deflocculating the colloids of clay as can be
done by dilute solutions of sodium carbonate or sodium
hydroxide, the clay develops its plastic properties with
considerably less water present.
The discussion thus far, has considered the possible
effects of electrolytes on the clay which bonds the sand
grains together. It has been shown that ferric hydrox-
ide influences this bond materially, but no theories
have been formed regarding its effect on a clay when
electrolytes are added. Suffice it to say that ferric hy-
droxide forms a stable colloidal sol in alkaline solu-
tion and dissolves in acid solution becoming an iron
salt. The iron sol may or may not be advantageous.
The iron salt is merely another electrolyte, and adding
any electrolyte tends to flocculate sols, even from alka-
line solutions. Flocculated iron hydroxide, which oc-
curs near the neutral point, is probably more valuable
than flocculated clay as a bonding material.
Although alkaline solutions tend to produce sols,
with less water, a gel would l&gt;e the result. In the case
of the ferric hydroxide, as well as the case of the clay,
it appears that their properties can be developed with
less water if there is some alkaline salt present.
The properties of molding sand have been studied
for some time and are at present fairly well understood,
but no attempt has been made to discover the effect of
electrolytes added to the sand. In view of the fact that
electrolytes cause such changes in the properties of
the bonding materials of molding sands, it seems that
an investigation along these lines might lead to valu-
able results.
Before any research is done, it seems that the neces-
sary water content may be reduced, that the permeabil-
ity can be increased, and that perhaps adhesiveness may
be improved by treatment with alkaline electrolytes.
The essential features of the necessary research in-
clude, first, testing a natural sand to obtain its proper-
ties, second, testing the electrolyte-treated sand to ob-
tain those properties, and then comparing the two
results for each electrolyte and concentration employed.

REMEDIES FOR CONTRACTURAL MISTAKES
(Continued from page 9)
drawn up contrary to the mutual intent of the parties.
Mistake Through Fraud
It would appear on the surface that a contract con-
ceived in fraud should be subject to rescission. The
interesting test develops in the determination of the
existence of fraud. It is not fraudulent to breach a
contract, but if one enters into a contract with abso-
lutely no intention of performing his portion of the
obligation, his actions are fraudulent. The court is
thus confronted with the problem of determining
whether the man originally intended to perform and
subsequently defaulted, or whether he never did in-
tend to perform.
Concealment of Material Facts
The matter of concealment of facts presents two or
three interesting situations. If the party who knows
the facts remains silent and takes advantage of the
situation knowing that the other party has not had the
professional or mental training to comprehend the true
situation, it appears that fraud may be present. Courts
are inclined to use this interpretation. In the sale of
land where the purchaser has full knowledge of the
existence of oil or minerals below the surface but
makes the purchase on the pretext of acquiring farm
land, he is liable to be acting fraudulently if the vendor
is old and incapacitated. On the other hand if the two
parties stand on an equal footing with the vendor being
merely ignorant of the contents of his property, he
cannot be heard to complain of any bad bargain which
has been honestly made with him. This is true since
the court does not presume a fraudulent intent on the
part of a vendee, but expects the buyer to secure the
best possible bargain for himself. This condition of
the law seems reasonable and is quite consistent with
the present day business practice that not only ''the
buyer must beware", but also that the seller must pro-
ceed cautiously.
Inadequacy of Consideration
Mistake in the value of the thing sold is not grounds
for rescission of the contract if both parties are inno-
cent. The courts will not grant rescission of a con-
tract where there is a mistake as to the value of the
thing sold, provided that there is no mistake as to the
quantity or quality of the subject-matter. Consistent
with this we find that courts refuse relief in the matter
of the inadequacy of the consideration and if relief is to
be had for any of this class of cases it is absolutely
essential that the plaintiff prove a fraudulent attitude
of mind on the part of the defendant.
Misrepresentation of Facts
It may be pertinent to point out that malicious intent
is not a necessary element for equitable relief in the
Page Twenty-six

THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC


sary that the defendant shall be acting with a con-
sciousness of the mistake. In short, rescission of a con-
tract may be allowed where the defendant has inno-
cently misrepresented the facts and the plaintiff, rely-
ing on such misrepresentation, has acted to his detri-
ment.
Rescission will not be granted however, where the
misrepresentation affects solely the value of the sub-
ject-matter of the transaction. For instance, if the
defendant sets up that a horse which he has for sale is
a very fine one, and in loud, positive terms alleges that
the animal is worth $300. while in reality it is only
worth $200, the plaintiff cannot be heard to complain
that he relied unduly upon the seller's mis-statement.
In other words "puffing" is a mere expression of
opinion and does not offer legal grounds for remedy.
The mistake against which equity will relieve must
be a mistake alxiut a material fact. Its jurisdiction
will be exercised only in the furtherance of justice. In
Hunter vs Carroll 64 X. H. 572 it was held that equity
will not order the removal of a house placed through
mutual ignorance of the boundaries so as to encroach a
little on plaintiff's land, where the damage caused by
the removal would be grossly disproportionate to plain-
tiff's injury.
Substantial justice, and not strict adherence to the in-
flexible rules of law, is the principle which guides the
court of inquiry in decisions on contractual mistakes.

An election of officers took place with the following
results: J. Lyon, chairman; G. Leland, vice-chairman;
I. Sattinger. secretary. D. J. C'arr, treasurer. Fol-
lowing this an interesting three-reel film by Webster
and Stone on "Nature's Frozen Assets" brought the
meeting to a close.
A. S. C. E.
The student branch of A. S. C. E., on our campus,
made its initial debut of 1932 an auspicious event.
The first meeting held at the Union recently clearly
indicated that no efforts are being spared in making the
ensuing year one of valuable activity. The large turn-
out of branch members further supplemented by the
attendance of section members from nearby localities
was indeed encouraging as well as exhibiting the mem-
bers' keen interest in organization functions.
At this meeting Mr. Herbert S. Crocker, a former
Michigan man, and at present, president of the National
senior organization, spoke on the "National Recon-
struction Corporation". Mr. Crocker related facts on
what has been done to date by the prominent men com-
posing the committee, adding that legal and engineering
aspects have at last become duly cooperated, paving
way to big government construction program with large
funds available to carry out the great task in an expedi-
ent manner.
The meeting was opened with a welcoming speech by
the newly elected president of the branch, Paul A.
Kauff through whose efforts the whole affair was a
real success. Professor Gram acted in the capacity of
a toastmaster, with President Ruth veil. Dean Sadler
and Professor Riggs as distinguished guests anil
speakers.
An extensive program composed of trips, dinner
meetings and lectures is now in view. The initiation
banquet always one of the high spots of the year in
branch activities adds about thirty-five new members
to the branch, an inspiring outlook.

Debate teams are already training for meetings with
Ypsilanti Normal College, when both the men and the
"Vpsi Girls" will be met. These debates will serve as
"warm-ups" for the debates between the various chap-
ters of the organization, which will occur next semester.
A good crop of freshmen have turned out this fall
for the training work, which augurs well for the future-
of the organization. The weekly meetings have been

of the Harmsworth Trophy,
holder of the world's speed
boat record.

What 6400 horsepower looks like. The
four Packard Twin-Six motors that draft
the "Miss America X" 124.91 miles an
hour to set a new world's speedboat rec-
ord. At the left. Gar Wood, owner and
pilot of the "Miss Americas." At the
right, Orlin Johnson, his mechanic.


The World's Fastest Boat
By Henry L Kohler, Mechanical Engineering Instructor
THE boat in which Gar Wood won the nineteen
hundred and thirty-two Harmsworth trophy race
on the choppy waters of Lake St. Clair and made
his subsequent speed trials for a new power boat record
shows evidence of a high degree of engineering refine-
ment, both in the craft itself and the power plant driv-
ing it. The record was brought from 119.81 up to
124.9 miles per hour, significant when it is recalled that
at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour, particularly
in water, the power required to obtain a small increase
in speed is many times that necessary to gain the same
increment at lower velocities.
Miss America X is thirty-eight feet long with a ten
foot beam, three feet longer and six inches wider than
Miss England III, the previous record holder. The
hull is of laminated mahogany, step construction, such
as is conventional in boats of this type. The bottom is
armored with a heavy sheet of stainless steel to resist
the impact loads incurred when striking rough waters
at high speeds. All the exposed wooden parts of the
boat are carefully set so that the grain fibers of the
mahogany are "smoothed down" by the action of the
water. The finish is a special varnish, highly polished
to reduce skin friction to a minimum. The hull is
kept on its course with a forward keel rudder. There
is no aft rudder but turning is facilitated by slowing
down one of the two propellors.
Four Packard V-12 engines are used in the craft.
They are placed in tandem, a pair driving each propel-
ler through a common gear lxxx. Timing is staggered
thirty degrees in order to secure maximum smoothness
of driving torque. The engines are of a six year old
aircraft design and were originally rated at 770 horse-
power and 2000 revolutions per minute. By raising
the engine speed to 2600 R.P.M. and supercharging
to an inlet pressure of 7.5 to 8 pounds per square inch,
this output was increased to 1600 horsepower. The
only structural changes were in the connecting rods
which were made slightly heavier to sustain the added
load. The volumetric compression ratio is 7.5 and,
with a bore of six and three eights inches and a six and
one half inch stroke, the displacement is 2540 cubic
inches per engine. At full power there is developed
0.63 horsepower per cubic inch. Good supercharged
aircraft practice shows from 0.4 to 0.5, horsepower per
cubic inch, generally running around 2000 R.P.M.
Miss America's engines, dry, weigh 1700 pounds each
complete with superchargers—slightly more than one
pound per horsepower developed. Water cooled air-
craft engines have a dry weight range of from 1.5 to
1.7 pounds per horsepower developed. However in the
light of these comparisons it must be remembered that
the aircraft engines must be designed for continuous
operation at the rated output, whereas Miss America's
engines, operating at full output, would be expected to
have a life of only a few hours.
Each engine is equipped with four duplex down draft
Holley carburetors, and carburetion is effected before
compression for supercharging. The temperature after
carburetion is only slightly above freezing but there is
a 130° F. rise in temperature through the compressors.
The latter are of the Roots blower type running at
1.86 engine speed, and each one supplies one bank of
six cylinders. The inlet manifolds are of drawn steel
and are provided with spring loaded safety valves to
prevent damage to the superchargers in case of back-
fire.
The fuel used is almost pure benzene, necessitated
by the high degree of supercharging, and fuel con-
sumption at full output totals four hundred and eighty
gallons per hour for the four engines. This is about
0.53 pounds per horsepower per hour. Good aircraft
practice ranges from 0.5 to 0.55 pounds per horse-
power per hour.
Cooling water is picked up through scoops on the
outside of the boat and travels to the two oil tanks
which are fitted with built in coolers. The water
passes into the engines and is discharged. The gear
boxes between the engines are also water cooled. When
it is considered that there is 9,000 pounds thrust on
each propellor shaft, and that 3200 horsepower must
be transmitted through a driving gear travelling 2600
revolutions per minute and a driven gear travelling
7000 revolutions per minute, the necessity for cooling
even very efficient gears is evident.
In spite of the almost unbelievable gains in power
that have been obtained with Gar Wood's engines over
their original counterparts, the Packard engineers claim
that the peak has not been reached. They say that,
with a few more structural changes, it is believed that
the output can be raised to 2000 horsepower at 3000
revolutions per minute.
Miss America the Xth is now on display, open to the
public, at the Packard show room, on Jefferson and St.
Antoine St.. Detroit.

Effective Noise Reduction
By P. M. Geiger, PH.D., Research Physicist
Portable sound testing equipment used for
road test on automobiles.
IN many branches of industry the economic value of
noise reduction is being appreciated more and
more each year, for a number of manufacturers
have found not only that the efficiency of their em-
ployees has been increased by a reduction in the noise
of their offices and factories, but also that the adoption
of means of quieting their product has lightened the
work of their salesmen. An in-
creasing number of purchasers com-
pare the quietness of various com-
peting machines before they make
their decision as to which to buy.
This of course holds true especially
for purchasers of equipment for use
in homes, and it also applies to
some extent to equipment used in
manufacturing.
It has been found that noise often
. produces undesirable, and even
harmful, physiological and psycho-
logical reactions. Even when an
individual has become so accustomed
to a noise that he is not conscious of its existence, un-
desirable effects still are produced. It is sometimes
said that noise in a machine indicates inefficiency. This
in general is not true, for an extremely loud noise rep-
resents only a minute amount of power. It has been
estimated that ten million cornets being blown fortissimo
would radiate in sound only one horsepower. From a
design viewpoint then, a reduction in noise cannot be
expected to increase appreciably the power efficiency
of a machine.
Usually the problem of designing a machine to ob-
tain a minimum noise is an individual problem for
each type of machine. However, there are a few prin-
ciples which will be of aid and which, when properly
applied, may prevent some of the common mistakes.
In general, the noise of a machine may be reduced by
making use of one or more of the following methods:
Reduction in the amount of sound radiated by pre-
venting the transmission of vibration to good sound
radiating surfaces; elimination of possibilities of reso-
nance, either mechanical or acoustic between any of the
noise components and a part of the machine; con-
struction of the rotating parts in a manner such that
the frequencies of the main noise components will lie
in a region of comparative insensitivity of the ear;

esting and significant article.
introduction of sound absorbing material; and estab-
lishment of close tolerances for moving parts, thereby
reducing play. Before showing how these general
methods of noise control can be applied to the design
of machinery, the method of designating noise will be
described together with the characteristics of the ear
which should be known to everyone who undertakes
a problem of noise reduction.
Before the loudness of a noise
can be measured, or even described,
a unit of loudness must be es-
tablished. The characteristics of
the average ear must be considered
in making the definition, for the
perception of sound is a psychologi-
cal process rather than a physical
process.
Since a musical tone is less com-
plex than a noise, the method of
designating it will be examined first.
The pitch of a tone may be speci-
fied by the frequency of vibration.
Since air-borne sound is essentially a fluctuation of
atmospheric pressure, the magnitude of a tone may be
specified by this fluctuation. A fluctuation in atmos-
pheric pressure having a frequency of -say 1000 cycles
per second corresponds to a reasonably loud sound
even if the fluctuation is only a millionth of atmos-
pheric pressure. A pure musical tone, that is, one
without harmonics (overtones) is specified completely
if its frequency and its acoustic pressure are given.
The technical description of a noise is not as easy as
is the description of a musical tone. Often no definite
pitch can be assigned. In general, a noise consists of
a number of musical tones together with irregular
sound impulses which may be termed "unpitched
noise". By measuring the frequency and acoustic
pressure of each of the musical tones and the acoustic
pressure of the unpitched noise, a means of describing
the noise is secured. However, since it often is de-
sired to express the loudness of a noise by a single
number, a means of doing this has been devised.
The ear responds to a limited range of frequency and
its sensitivity varies greatly over this range. A curve
may be plotted showing the sound pressure of the min-
imum audible tone as a function of frequency. A higher
curve will then give the threshold of feeling in sound
Page Six

ing pressures corresponding to values above the upper
curve stimulate the sense of feeling and are painful to
the ear. Sounds having pressures corresponding to
pressures below the lower curve cannot be heard by
the average ear. Such charts represent average re-
sults obtained from tests on a large number of observ-
ers. Curves for individuals are frequently quite dif-
ferent from the average. The unit of pressure usually
taken is the bar which is equal to one dyne per square
centimeter or 0.0000145 pounds per square inch. At-
mospheric pressure is about 1,000,000 bars.
From the above discussion it is evident that the
amplitude of a sound expressed in units of pressure
does not represent adequately the loudness of sound.
For example, a sound of frequency 1000 cycles per
second having an acoustic pressure of 0.2 bar will be
comparatively loud, whereas a sound having the same
pressure but of a frequency of 50 cycles per second
cannot be heard. If the sound pressures of two sounds,
which are of equal loudness to the ear but which are
of different frequencies, are increased or decreased an
equal amount, they then will not be equally loud. From
these considerations it is evident that the relation be-
tween sound pressure and loudness is not simple.
In order to have a scale which will assign the same
values of loudness to all tones which appear to be of
equal loudness to the ear, it is necessary to establish a
suitable loudness scale for a single frequency and to
provide that all tones which appear equally loud to the
average ear are assigned the same loudness value. A
tone of frequency 1000 cycles per second usually is

chosen as the reference tone. The loudness scale gives
the relation between loudness and sound pressure by
the following equation:
Loudness = 20 log &gt;0 P
(1)
where P is the acoustic pressure of a 1000 cycle per
second tone of loudness equal to the sound being speci-
fied, and P0 is the acoustic pressure of the 1000 cycle
tone which barely is perceptible to the average ear. The
unit of loudness defined by this equation is called a
decibel. One decibel corresponds roughly to the mini-
mum loudness change which the ear can detect under
the best conditions.
Reference Tone Pressure Needed
In order to designate the loudness of a tone of known
pressure and of some frequency other than that of the
reference tone, it is necessary to know the pressure of
the reference tone which appears equally as loud to
the ear. This pressure has been determined experi-
mentally for various frequencies and the data plotted
out for convenient reference use. The curves give
the acoustic pressures of tones of different frequencies
which have loudness of 10, 20, 30, etc. decibels on
the loudness scale under discussion. As will be shown,
these curves may be useful in designing machines,
for by their use it may be possible to determine which
of several types of construction will be the most quiet.
In order to designate the loudness of a noise it is
also necessary to know the pressure of the equally loud
reference tone. To determine this value experimentally,
sound measuring equipment usually is necessary, illus-
trations of which are shown on these pages.
Although loudness measurements are of great value
in comparing the noises made by different modifications
of a given machine, they do not give all the information
which may be desired. For example, they cannot give
the relative importance of the various components of a
noise. A great deal of effort often is wasted by re-
ducing or eliminating components of the noise which
are of minor importance. Due to the logarithmic re-
sponse of the ear and due to the peculiar way in which
the ear adds the different components of sounds, it is

usually of little benefit to reduce any of the noise
components other than the loudest. For example, if
we have a machine with a loudness of 60 decibels and
find by measurement that the noise made by the ball
bearings operating alone has a loudness of 50 decibels,
one is apt to assume that considerable noise reduction
could be secured if the bearing noises were eliminated.
Such is not the case, however, for even if noiseless
bearings could be found, the loudness of the machine
would be reduced only from 60 decibels to 59.5 decibels.
In a few cases the elimination of a single noise com-
ponent may be extremely desirable even though the
total loudness of the machine may not be altered per-
ceptibly thereby. This will be the case when the com-
ponent possesses a particularly annoying character-
istic. Any noise, if loud, is of course annoying, but
two noises which are equally loud are not necessarily
equally disagreeable. The annoyance feature of a noise
is, to a great degree, determined by the mental associa-
tions connected with it. For example, a noise which
sounds like the noise of a bearing badly in need of
lubrication will be disagreeable to a man accustomed to
working with machinery.
Since it is desirable that efforts to reduce the noise of
a machine be confined to those parts of the machine
which produce the loudest or most disagreeable noise
components, the analysis of noise is of great advantage.
A sample noise analysis of the particular piece of equip-
ment may be run and the results plotted out on suit-
able charts. A test was run in the laboratory here on
a vacuum cleaner and will serve to show what infor-
mation one of these analyses may give. The fre-
quency of the tone and the acoustic pressure it pro-
duces may be plotted on equal loudness contours,
giving the loudness of each component of the noise.
Total loudness of the machine is then taken from inter-
polation on another scale on the same chart.
The machine tested was equipped with a rotating
brush running at a speed of about 40 revolutions
per second. If one impulse was sent out on each
revolution, the frequency of the fundamental of the
resulting tone would of course be 40 cycles per second.
A tone of this frequency was not found, but tones
having frequencies corresponding to the second,
fourth, sixth, and eighth harmonics were found.
Since only the even harmonics are present, it prob-
ably is safe to conclude that the action which pro-
duced sound occurred twice each revolution. The tone of
frequency about 140 cycles per second shows that, al-
though the rotor was slightly out of balance, this would
not decrease the machine noise perceptibly. The cleaner
used for this test was equipped with a fan for cooling
the motor as well as the main suction fan. Fan tones
due to each of these fans are prominent, although the
suction fan gave a much louder tone.
Magnetic Tones Important
Three tones came out on the test as being mag-
netic tones. Each time an armature slot passes a
field pole tip the magnetization of the tip changes.
These periodic changes in magnetization produce sound
because of the resulting variation of the force on the
laminations and because of the actual change in dimen-
sions of the iron due to the magneto-striction effect.
The frequency of the middle of the three magnetic
tones is equal to the product of the number of armature
slots times the speed expressed in revolutions per sec-
ond. The cause of two outer tones is quite inter-
esting: When the measurements were taken the machine
was operated on 60 cycle alternating current, so the
current through the motor windings passed through
zero 120 times per second; this modulated the true
magnetic tone thereby giving rise to the two side band
frequencies, one 120 cycles below the magnetic tone
frequency, the other above.
An examination into the data shows that the suction
fan tone and the magnetic tone are the two loudest
components in the noise of the machine. Reducing or
eliminating any of the tones other than these two, will
have little effect on reducing the machine noise, unless
these two are reduced greatly.
Keeping in mind the characteristics of the ear and the
relation between pressure measurements and loudness
as outlined in the foregoing, consideration may often be
given to these general methods of noise reduction in
the design of machinery.

Speech Work for Engineers
By Earl C. Briggs, '33 E.
DURING the last five years at the University of
Michigan and other colleges there has arisen a
group of engineering students who have banded
together to assist each other in making a study of prac-
tical speech work. This work is of a type which re-
quires constant practice and continual striving for per-
fection, being in part a manual skill. It takes much
valuable time to accomplish results. Many engineers
believe that those who have thus spent their time could
have done more to train themselves for engineering by
spending this time following technical knowledge. How-
ever, it is my I&gt;elief that extra-curricular work on speech
problems, although necessarily stealing much time from
the pursuit of definite engineering facts, nevertheless
is highly desirable.
To justify this belief, it is necessary to first show that
engineering is in need today of more than merely
technical knowledge. Any serious study of the condi-
tions of the industries and the social system into which
the future engineers are to be placed shows that at the
present time, or more properly, at the present period of
history, the civilized nations have reached a saturation
of pure technical knowledge. It is not being here con-
tended that technical perfection is not still to be striven
for, but that at present it no longer is "the neck of
the lx&gt;ttle" in our social progress. We hear throughout
the nation grumblings against the machine age and the
engineer. The masses knowing not which way to turn
in the threatening chaos are about to turn on that tech-
nical advancement which has made the machine age.
As H. G. Wells, the noted historian so ably states his
contention:
''When millions of able-bodied men can find no
work, when coffee, cotton and wheat must be de-
stroyed in various parts of the world, while mil-
lions shiver and starve, it has become clear, that
whether we want it or not, we are facing the near
necessity of a fundamental revision of capitalistic
society."
It can not be denied that the situation of the present
scheme of production and distribution is facing an un-
certain future.
From the signs of the times, the engineering pro-
fession should take its cue. Technical developments
furnish the basis of our present civilization and those
men who understand the machine are going to be called
upon to help solve this problem of what to do with

the machines that they have developed. The engineer
must have at his command more than a formula for the
determination of stresses and strains in lifeless material.
As the profession comes into closer contact with these
social values it must as a body acquire, either in college
or through experience, a new appreciation of subjects
outside calculus and hydraulics and five minute speeches
on "How a pump works".
Now one may well ask. "What does extra-curricular
speech training have to do with this new status of the
engineer?" A fair question, but one which can be
answered by showing that extra-curricular speech work
is one of the best methods available for instilling into
the engineer the proper attitude and abilities necessary
to his new position.
About the easiest way for the author to show what
is being accomplished in many engineering colleges
today by extra-curricular speech training is to explain
this movement as it has been developed at Michigan by
the organization of Sigma Rho Tau, better known as
the "Stump Speaker's Club". This organization has
expanded from the original chapter at the Michigan
College of Engineering to a prospective national society
with several chapters.
The society is headed by a national executive com-
mittee composed of representatives from the various
chapters. The most important member of the national
organization from a training standpoint is the national
director who assists the local faculty sponsors at the
chapters.
In the various chapters the student members are or-
ganized into a number of small groups of about ten
which are supervised by the older student members and
which meet once a week for the purpose of actual
speech practice. In these practice meetings every mem-
ber speaks at every meeting. The whole group is as-
sembled each week before the individual circle (small

Bailments
By Professor Walter C. Sadler
The Law Quadrangle
A BAILMENT is that transaction where the bailor
delivers personalty to the bailee for a specific
purpose. It is necessary that the parties in-
tend that the specific goods will be returned by the
bailee, or otherwise disposed of as agreed upon. An
essential characteristic of a bailment is that the "title"
of the article remains in the bailor, while the "posses-
sion" passes to the bailee.
Characteristics
Consistent with their contract, the bailee is obligated
to return the goods to the bailor at the appointed time.
The bailee may find himself in some difficulties in this
matter. For instance, if the bailee considers the goods
he is keeping for the bailor are his own, he is never-
theless obligated at law to return them to the bailor.
This emphasizes the necessity of the bailee to observe
the obligations of the bailment. Of course, there may
be times when the goods have been taken from the
bailee by a third party and it is physically impossible
to return them to the bailor. For instance, if a third
party should establish by an action in replevin that the
goods were in fact his and not the bailor's, he could
secure the sheriff's assistance in taking the goods from
the bailee. Such "due process of law" would be a suf-
ficient defense should the bailor attempt to hold the
bailee for an accounting.
Based upon somewhat different circumstances would
be the case where the bailee learns that the bailor has
stolen the goods. To return them on the demand of
the bailor would make the bailee an accessory to the
commission of a felony. In such a case the bailee
should hold them for the true owner. In this con-
nection, however, the bailee is acting at his own peril.
If he turns over the goods to one claiming paramount
title, he will bear the burden of proof that he acted
correctly.
But the bailee cannot refuse to turn over the goods
to the bailor on the mere allegation that the bailor was
not the true owner. A case of over two hundred years'
standing supports this rule. In Armory vs Delamarie.
1 Strange 505 (Court of King's Bench. 1721) a boy
found a valuable jewel which he took to a goldsmith for
appraisal. The goldsmith refused to return the stone
saying that the boy had no title to it. The court, how-
ever, ruled that a finder has title against everyone in
the world except the true owner and ordered the gold-
smith, as a bailee, to return the jewel to the boy.
Liability of Bailee
The liability of the bailee safely to care for the goods
depends upon the nature of the transaction. Bailments
have been divided into three general classifications,
based upon the benefit derived from the relationship.
The bailment-for-hire presupposes a mutual benefit to
the bailor and bailee, as where an automobile is taken
to a garage for repair. In such an instance we expect
the garage to be responsible for "ordinary care" and
the bailee's liability for an injury to the car would be
governed by such a test. If the bailee is the sole bene-
ficiary, that is, if he has borrowed the car, he must
exercise the utmost care in his use of the property. In
fact, he assumes almost an insurer's responsibility to see
that the car is returned without injury. On the other
hand, if the bailor is the sole beneficiary, as where he
stores his car on the bailee's property with the bailee's
permission, but free of charge, the bailment assumes
an entirely different aspect. The bailee is now re-
sponsible only if he is "wilfully negligent''. These
three degrees of the bailee's liability are of long stand-
ing in the law and still apply to present-day cases.
The engineer may be somewhat interested in the
extent of the liability of the bailee-for-hire to repair
rented equipment. For instance, the railroad freight
car is in a state of bailment when on a foreign line.
It seems reasonable that this foreign line should be
liable for the ordinary running repairs of the car while
it is on the line. However, for unusual repairs, those
not merely incidental to use, the bailee should not as-
sume the full burden. These matters may all be made
items of agreement, with a bailee repairing the equip-
ment at the bailor's expense. Agreements of this kind
are construed very strictly, and a bailee may avoid
expenses for extraordinary repair by carefully in-
specting the condition of the equipment upon receipt. In
view of these facts it would seem that the bailee should
pay any insurance charges arising out of risk of run-
ning repairs, while the bailor should pay for the charges
to meet the risks of extraordinary repairs. The com-

EAST is east and west is west but how many ever
heard of the neck of woods called Corning, New
York. However, in justice to all villages, towns
and ranges not all big men come from the big cities and
this we hasten to prove to you with this month's spot-
light personality—the well known De Elton J. Carr.
We have always liked D-Jay (the latter being his
campus monicker) and to us he's true blue and a real
friend to have. Being a modest young chap he natural-
ly dislikes any of the phases of publicity but after a lit-
tle convincing he did submit (like a true sportsman) to
the end that our readers may likewise learn to become
self-made men.
D-Jay must have led a wretched childhood for his
ever undying lament is that school was his greatest
curse. It's true that in his early life he was not afforded
the opportunity of a big city. However, his long sup-
pressed aspiration, that of becoming another Steinmetz.
took one pre-depression stock-market jump when he
reached dear old Ann Arbor.
Entering the Engineering College in the Fall of 1929
he immediately began to carve a name for himself in
the annals of his Alma Mater when he promptly made
Phi Eta Sigma. Serious and studious as he was
he did, nevertheless, find time for other things and in
the Spring of 1930 he betook himself to try out for a
place on the Technic staff. It was not long before he
graduated from the obscure rank of a tryout to that
of an assistant account manager. In this capacity he
displayed such uncanny ability in keeping the paper at
all times in the blue that he has been an invaluable
member of the staff ever since.
Frosh days are days of tears and woe. as many an
effeminate freshman will readily testify. So imagine,
dear readers, D-Jay's embarrassment when one day he
so involuntarily, yet without hesitation (as he had some
premonition as to what was best for him) proceeded
without a flicker of the eyelid an.d as composed as if he
had gone through the mill time and again previous to
this, to sink to his knees begging a fair Co-ed passing
by Nichol's Arcade at the time, to listen to his gust of
love-worn promises and become his cherished mate.
And that is not all, the time he pushed his cigarette
with the tip of his nose down State street was a hil-
arity act unsurpassed. Many an inch of good old nose-
hide ground State street that day.
Sophomore year saw the genial D-Jay devote his
time almost entirely to books, while in the few fleeting
De Elton J. Carr

spare moments he raced over to the Technic office to
do his bit there. By this time he increased his rank
on the staff to that of accounts manager steadily forg-
ing his way forward.
But success had by no means entered our young
man's head. In his junior year at school D-Jay pro-
ceeded to do things with the same fervor as had marked
him in the past. Although a man of but few words, it's
his deeds that speak for themselves. His devotion to
fellow students' welfare won him a place in the Tri-
angles. The Triangles further honored him that year
when they named him their president. As a conse-
quence of his scholarship and campus activity he was
elected to both Tau Beta Pi and Vulcans the spring of
that year. But D-Jay aside from his other admirable as-
sets is a shrewd and capable business man, too. This is
best proven when we tell you that he is our present
business manager and the financial status of our mag-
zine is fast rising on its upward trend even in this time
of depression. He also was the chairman of the ticket
sales committee of the Slide Rule dance last year.
Early this fall he was elected treasurer of the A.I.
E.E. another point in his favor when speaking of
business men. Next June he will receive his B.S. in
E.E. which will take him away from us to other things
that follow the inevitable cycle of life. However,
while we still have him in our circle let's be happy—
because we can vouch that his personality has won him
innumerable close friends and our contention is that
D-Jay is another good excuse for the old saying "a
scholar and a gentleman."
Scientists Convene at Ann Arbor
The American Academy of Sciences, the most dis-
tinguished scientific body in the United States whose
members include the foremost and internationally
known scientists assembled here recently for its an-
nual autumnal session. The meeting marked the first
time in the history of the Academy that it has met
at the University of Michigan.
The organization of the Academy dates back to 1863.

Our Professors
Professor
B. F. Bailey
The Engineering College faculty may justly boast
of possessing some of the outstanding men in the en-
gineering profession of today. The electrical depart-
ment attributes its ability in producing capable young
engineers to the fact that it has a finely balanced
teaching staff embracing a number of splendid senior
engineers. Professor Benjamin F. Bailey is one such
man.
Professor Bailey is a native of this state, being born
in Sheridan, Michigan where he spent the earliest part
of his life. In the course of time he attended the Uni-
versity of Michigan, where he received his B.S. in E.E.
in 1898. Records also show that in his junior and
senior years he was Varsity miler and half miler on
Keene Fitzpatrick's Michigan track team.
The first year after his graduation he spent as a de-
signer with the Edison Illuminating Company of De-
troit and the following year he spent in the testing lab-
oratories of the General Electric Company in Schenec-
tady, New York. In 1900 he returned to school to re-
ceive his A.M., which he followed up with a Ph.D. in
1907.
He became associated with the University faculty
staff in 1901 and his first year he instructed in Electro
Therapeutics. Following this he instructed in other
courses in electrical engineering during which time he
became first an Assistant Professor and then a Pro-
fessor in 1913.
The "Who's Who in America" further lists him as
a patent expert, consulting engineer of the Howell
Electric and Fairbanks Morse Motor Companies, also
as a director of both concerns besides being a director
and vice president of Fremont Motor Corporation, as
author of the following technical books: Induction
Coils, 1903; Induction Motors, 1911; Elementary Elec-
trical Engineering, 1913; and Principles of Dynamo
Electrical Machinery, 1915. As inventor of a single
phase capacitor motor now used extensively by four-
teen electrical companies of the United States, as a fre-
quent contributor to scientific journals and as an
authority on induction motors, he also excels.
Professor Bailey is a member of the Society of Auto-
motive Engineers and a Fellow in the American In-
stitute of Electrical Engineers. He belongs to the
Faculty Michigan Union Club and the Barton Hills
Country Club. He is also a member of Sigma Xi and
Tau Beta Pi.
But "Who's Who", which lists all these activities,
does not mention his love of boating and sailing and
the fact that when he was unable to purchase a good
marine engine, early in the century, he built one of his
own. He even confesses ownership of an outboard
motor which he hopes to race some day.
Joint Session of A. I. Ch. E.
The University of Michigan chapter of the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers, an organization of the
student chemical engineers, recently held a joint sec-
tion session here in Ann Arbor, at which time Detroit
Engineers, members of A.I.Ch.E. and other section
members of nearby localities joined the local student
branch and faculty members in a session which lasted
two days. Interesting and educating talks, tours, in-
spection trips, personal contacts and a dinner comprised
a well worked out program.
This meeting was held primarily to fulfill the or-
ganization's basic aim: the desire to promote the ad-
vancement of chemical engineering knowledge and to
provide a bond of common interest and fellowship
among fellow-members. Towards this end the whole
program tended and splendid moral success was
achieved.
On the first day of the session, that of November
18th, a meeting was held in the East Engineering build-
ing and a number of short talks were given by profes-
sors of the chemical engineering department. The
principal speaker of the evening was Mr. Homer Clou-
key of the Sharples Specialty Company and his sub-
ject as "Centrifugal Force and its Application to In-
dustry". On the following afternoon, an inspection of
chemical engineering laboratories was carried through
by Professor W. L. Badger and a tour of the metallur-
gical laboratories was conducted by Professor C. Up-
thegrove. A dinner meeting at the Michigan Union
terminated the session which carried with it a wealth of
educative information and important personal contacts
for the student members.

Clyde R. Paton, '23 E

THIS month, we have turned over the pages of
the records of the Electrical engineering depart-
ment to find another alumnus whose rapid ad-
vancement has made him outstanding. Our inside
dope on this gentleman has impressed us very favorably
so we decided to get one of our news hounds out on
the joh to check up more carefully. Well, he didn't
have to go far and he did a very thorough job of fact
finding. With all this news lying before us we hope
to be able to present to you an accurate account of Mr.
Clyde R. Paton, Chief Engineer of the Packard Motor
Car Company.
According to the reports, Mr. Paton, like so many
other men who have risen as the result of their own in-
genuity and hard effort, dislikes talking about him-
self and we sincerely hope that we have enough materi-
al here to do him justice.
Mr. Paton was born in Almont, Michigan in 1894
where he received his preliminary education. His first
inclination toward anything in the engineering line be-
came evident in about 1908 when he worked at re-
pairing the comparatively crude automobile of that
time. He continued work in general garage service
until 1915 when he turned to another field, also still in
its infancy. He spent the next few years in doing
rather general electrical service in Port Huron, Mt.
Clemens and the Thumb District. When the war final-
ly involved the United States, Mr. Paton, who had
experience with various types of engines, was quali-
fied to enter the Army Air Service. He remained with
the Army for two years, working with the rickety
"Jennies" of that decade.
Having now acquired the practical experience neces-
sary for knowledge of the operation of internal com-
bustion engines, he entered the University of Michigan
to learn the theoretical side of the field. This was in
1919. Although he enrolled in the Electrical Depart-
ment of the University he finally ended up with Pro-
fessor Pawlowski in the Aeronautical department. His
student career is especially noteworthy. He was a stu-
dent assistant in the Aero and Auto departments. He
was voted into Tau Beta Pi and was a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He was also Tracing Assistant
here in Ann Arbor for two years. This account of Mr.
Paton's higher academic career, in spite of its brevity,
undoubtedly proves that he made the most of his time
here and that his four years here were highly suc-
cessful.
His next two years were spent in Hampton, Virginia
at Langley Field. He served there on the National
Advisory Committee for Aviation in charge of Re-
search Engineering. Here his chief interest was again
placed in the high compression engine. What was
known of the Diesel Engine at that time was very
meager. About all these Research Engineers had to
work on was a principal. The two years spent in this
sort of Research not only resulted in remarkable con-
tributions in the development of the diesel engine but
helped Mr. Paton to make himself an even more versa-
tile engineer than he had been with his knowledge of
electricity, aerodynamics, and internal combustion en-
gines which used ignition systems.
From 1920 to the present time automobile manu-
facturers have been expending a great deal of effort
in trying to give their customers something smoother
in the way of an automobile, not only on the power end
of the problem but also in body design. A combined
knowledge of aerodynamics and automobile power units
was something the automobile manufacturers were
looking for. Consequently, the Studebaker Company
decided to see if they could use Mr. Paton as a Re-
search Engineer. In five years he performed his du-
ties in his characteristically speedy and efficient man-
ner. He was then offered an opportunity for the same
kind of work at the Packard Plant and in 1930 he as-
sumed his duties as Research Engineer. His work for
the following year was outstanding and did not escape
the notice of his employers. In 1931, one year after
entering the concern, he was made Chief Engineer.
Perhaps it would be interesting to look over the work
Mr. Paton has so ably accomplished in the past two
years or so. Since the day when automobile manufac-
turers first mounted their engines on rubber, put the
car on balloon tires and used four wheel brakes, wheel
shimmy and front end vibrating motion at high speeds
have become problems for the research engineer. Mr.
Paton was assigned to the task of perfecting some sort
of device for preventing these undesirable properties
in the modern automobile.
During his career at Packard, he succeeded in per-
fecting a front harmonic balancing device which seems
to have cured the ills. A paper by Mr. Paton was pub-
lished in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Journal entitled
"Frame Design and Front-End Stability", in which he
gives a detailed description of the problems he con-
fronted and the methods used in determining what
should be done about them. Recently he has been in-

Why An Engineering Council?
The fact of the existence of the Engineering Council
and the functions it is supposed to discharge in the life
of the College of Engineering are undoubtedly un-
known to more students than those of any other organ-
ization on the campus. No one will attempt to deny the
fact that this condition is extremely unhealthy for the
organization and one which it would do them well to
look into. There are two possible reasons for the ac-
cumulation of this situation in the past few years.
Either the Council is working silently and efficiently or
it is not doing enough to exert sufficient influence to
justify its existence. The first case is rather hard to
conjecture but we would not say that it was impossible.
The latter rather time honored charge against the col-
lege "honor society" is not often brought against an
organization which was originally founded for some
definite, dynamic purpose. The reason for this is
simply that this type of group requires motivation to
keep it intact and usually dies out naturally if such a
charge becomes justifiable. But it is one which has
been frequently brought in the last two or three years
against several campus bodies which have persisted in
hanging on though their usefulness has long since
passed the way of the old time "Rah Rah'* boy. The
general question, of which this is a particular problem,
is one of student over-organization, due either to a
desire for a continued personal aggrandizement or the
machinations of playboy politics and such college child-
ishness.
Granting, then, that the ordinary student considers
the Engineering Council merely another place on the
ballot for the annual joke of class elections, it would
be well for all of us to analyze the group makeup more
fully before we jump to any conclusion that it is only
a second thumb on a five finger hand. Its personnel
includes the head of each of the various technical so-
cieties and other engineering student groups and sev-
eral elected members of the four classes. Its acknowl-
edged purpose is the coordination of the various student
organizations, the control of student activity, and the
encouragement of cooperation between the various un-
dergraduate groups. Naturally this would try to in-
clude leadership and the execution of all functions of
the student body not specifically within the scope of
another organization.
But it is not this purpose which has called out the
criticisms of the students. Even if the Council did
nothing more than merely provide a good place for each
organization to iron out particular wrinkles in common
it would serve admirably. The charge is usually inef-
ficiently and non-fulfillment—that the Council fails to
earn the dues it charges the organizations and classes.
On the credit side the activities of the Council are
now three, in the main. Engineering class elections are
carried out by their committees in conjunction with the
Student Council. An all-engineering Smoker, of no
little success and value, is held annually in the Spring.
And the Senior Cap and Gown Committee is now a part
of its functions. There is little doubt that these three
are important and valuable contributions to the student
life of the College.
And now, from the other side, criticism points out
these adverse arguments. The Council holds only two
or three indefinite, will of the wind, meetings a semester
and offers thus very little opportunity for organization
heads to get together. There are many chances for
cleaning up class elections, abolishing worthless student
offices, and correcting other evils which have been lying
dormant for years. Other student organizations have
had to step into the field and perform alien functions
for which they should not now be deprived of credit
such as a new classification system and the revival of
an engineers' dance, to name a few instances. Attend-
ance at meetings is very poor and there appears to be
little holding the group together. Its few jobs, it is
claimed, could be well handled by some of the larger,
more active organizations, further increasing their use-
fulness and decreasing the burden of class dues, etc.,
with the possible view of finally eliminating them.
Both sides of the question have been canvassed with
these conflicting arguments—we present them to you,
student, and invite you to make your own decision.
And whichever way you feel, this article will have
served its purpose and at least you'll know what the
Council is. And if you'd like to start a good discussion,
write in your opinion. Enough comment certainly won't
hurt and may do some good—it depends.
Shoe Leather vs Brains
"The first mistake that most job-hunters make—and
it is made by those who have no jobs and by those who
are seeking to change jobs—is to use their shoe-leather
instead of their brains" says Earl B. Morgan, employ-
ment expert, in a recent interview on how to get a job.
At the present time, more than ever before, the shoe-
leather plan of job hunting does not get results. What
a jobless man should do, and this is especially pertinent
to June graduates, is to make a careful analysis, first,
of what he can do best, and then of the employers who
are most likely to need the kind of services he is pre-
pared to render. Having thought these points over, he
should then present a written application for an in-

definite reasons why he wants to work for the firm to
which he is applying.
Getting a job is a selling proposition, first, last, and
all the time, whether it be a job as clerk or engineer.
You must realize that as a job hunter you have just
three things to sell: First, your general ability; second
your ability to do a particular kind of work; third, your
personality, that is, your character, dress, manners, and
your ability to work with a company's policies and
regulations.
Before writing a letter applying for a job there are
many things to be considered, both about analyzing
yourself—that is—compiling facts about what you have
to offer in ability, education, and experience—and also
about analyzing the market—that is, the employers who
are. most likely to have suitable work for you, inas-
much as you do not want to sell yourself to the wrong
firm. The letter is just a preparation for the interview,
therefore, the more thinking and analyzing you do in
planning the letter, the more prepared you will be for
the interview.
With these facts in mind, sit down at a desk and write
out everything pertaining to these facts and segregate
them into the proper division. Having done that, start
writing your letter. The letter should then have the
following information: Request for interview; Age,
-height, weight, religion, ambitions; Education in detail,
when, where, and what courses studied; Record of pre-
vious employment, how long and why change, if any,
was made; References from both employers and social
acquaintances of good standing, and lastly a photograph
of yourself. Then send this letter to the biggest and
best of the concerns you wish to locate with.
This method of using your brains will be far more
successful than the shoe-leather plan of walking from
plant to plant, for it gives the employer in advance all
the information about you that the shoe-leather one
never does; and in the end brings about the interview
which produces the much sought-after job.

Applied Mechanics Research Laboratory
IN parallel with the growing tendency in industry for
men equipped to carry out research and for knowl-
edge of a fundamental type concerning a variety
of problems in applied mechanics, a laboratory for
this work has been developed at the University under
the direction of Professor S. Timoshenko. Here a
number of graduate students are engaged in projects
both of experimental and theoretical nature.
High temperature and plasticity problems employ-
ing steel and lead singly and in combinations of torsion,
tension and bending are studied. By the photoelastic
method of stress analysis, stress concentration at the

East Hall—A Venerable Engineering College Antique
fillets of tension and bending members including the
practical case of connecting rods of radial engines is
investigated. Fatigue is receiving much attention where
various steels are tested in torsion and the effect of dif-
ferent types of notches in torsion and in bending
specimens is observed. In the field of dynamics a num-
ber of demonstration models are being developed to
illustrate and study sliding friction, gyroscopic action
and vibration problems. Recent work has been ac-
complished in the torsion and bending by use of the
membrane analogy. Information is being accumulated
on the properties of the light alloys. Several prob-
lems in stress analysis are being solved of a purely
theoretical type.
This laboratory contains some of the most recent
research equipment for investigating these problems.
The apparatus and displays showing the character and
results of the work done in the laboratory are gener-
ously utilized in presenting a clear and stimulating
practice to the undergraduate students of the nature
of the advanced work which is based on the elementary
courses in engineering mechanics.
New Calendar for 1933

Notes of the
Profession
The Airship "Macon's" Hangar
Airship Hangar for the "Macon"
When the new airship hangar, at Sunnyvale, Cali-
fornia is completed, more than seven miles of welding
will have gone into its construction. The dimensions
of this giant structure, which is to house the new U.S.
Navy dirigible "Macon", sister ship to the "Akron",
will be approximately 1200 feet in length by 308 feet
in width by 225 feet in height. Xot only will this hang-
ar be one of the largest buildings in the world, but it
will be the largest building in the world without pillars
or posts to support it. The hangar, which will be in
the shape of an enormous elongated archway, will have
the world's largest single unobstructed floor area, near-
ly 300.000 square feet, a space large enough to house
five miles of freight cars. Eighty-five hundred tons of
steel are going into the frame of the structure.
A 207-Mile Pipe Line
A Los Angeles fuel company has recently constructed
a 26-inch pipe line from Kettleman Hills to Long
Beach, California, a distance of 207 miles. The pur-
pose of this pipe line is to provide a supply of natural
gas for steam power generation at Long Beach and
for distribution to Los Angeles and vicinity.
This line has a capacity of 130 million cubic feet
of gas per day. Three different thicknesses of steel
were used in fabricating the pipe, 5/16 of an inch at
the Kettleman Hills end of the line, where the pres-
sure was greatest, graduated down to 9/32 of an inch,
and finally 1/4 of an inch on the lowest pressure section
of the line. The system is designed for an initial
pressure of 400 pounds and a minimum pressure, at
the extreme southern terminus, of 50 pounds.
Chemical Mechanism of Lubrication
In a paper presented before the annual meeting of
the A.S.M.E. on December 8 in New York City, the
chemical mechanism of lubrication was discussed by
William F. Parish and Leon Cammen, whose intro-
ductory paper on this subject, published in June, 1932
has attracted world wide attention.
In the paper presented before the society this month,
it is pointed out that lubrication is essentially a chemi-
cal phenomenon, and can be visualized better in the
light of recent progress made in physical chemistry
generally and in surface chemistry in particular.
An analogy to electric fields is used to explain why
excessive heat is developed when a dry shaft runs in
a dry bearing. The paper gives a clear exposition of
the mechanics of lubrication, explaining how the lubri-
cant is able to bear enormous loads.
The practical part of the paper discloses for the first
time how, during the war, the lubrication of Liberty
Engines and other aircraft was tremendously improved
by a retreated lubricant. The same lubricant was later
tested in Diesel engines, automobiles, and special equip-
ment giving unusual results.
The paper will prove extremely valuable in the fur-
ther development of lubricating theory. New criteria
for the testing of lubricants have been established. The
paper lays a practical foundation for future research
in the field of manufacture of lubricating oils and their
application in modern machinery. The data on the
lubrication of aircraft in the war may lead to the de-
velopment of lubricants of much greater efficiencies.
Progress at Hoover Dam
Excavation at Hoover Dam has been going ahead
rapidly since it began more than a year ago. More than
10,000.000 cubic yards of muck and gravel must be
handled; and for that reason, the electric power shovel
is being used because of its many advantages. The
electric power shovel does not impose any additional
ventilation problems of its own, it can be obtained in
suitable sizes, and it offers economical operation. Pow-
er is supplied through a three-conductor cable.
The first step in the construction of the dam is the
driving of four great diversion tunnels through solid
rock to carry the water around the dam site until the
dam has been partially put in place. The machinery
for digging these tunnels was floated down the river on
barges, so as to obviate the delay required to build
roads. Work on the tunnels was started on May 12,
1931 and completed in May, 1932.
Electrical mucking machines, combining a conveyor
with a digging dipper, discharge into ten-ton storage
battery locomotives which haul their load from the

Death Rides on Tires
One of the important sources of auto-
mobile accidents is the prevalence of
worn-out tires. A recent survey indicates
that one car out of ten, or a total of
2,000,000 cars, is operating with at least
one unfit tire. An automobile traveling
sixty miles an hour is no safer than its
weakest tire; for if a front tire should
blow out while the machine is traveling
at this speed, the driver loses all control
of his car and the chances are that driver
and car will land in the ditch. It is
therefore poor economy to use tires from
which the tread has disappeared.
The length of a tire's safe and useful
life varies considerably with the use given
it. With increased speed, tire wear is more per mile
than for lower speeds. Fourteen thousand safe miles
on concrete is equivalent to 2500 miles of travel over
crushed stone road in good condition. LInderinflation
or overinflation shortens the life of the tire materially.
High temperature operation also has a deleterious ef-
fect on the life of the tire.
In order to maintain adequate standards of tire con-
struction, elaborate testing laboratories have been con-
structed by the various manufacturing concerns, and
tires are subjected to many different tests.
In the guillotine test a sharp, heavy weight is drop-
ped onto the tire for the purpose of testing its carcass
strength. It is possible either to drop the weight onto
the tire or the tire onto the weight and in practice
both ways are used. By varying the type of anvil or
guillotine used, the tire may be subjected to many dif-
ferent kinds of bruises.
Another test is the "pulley wheel test", in which a
heavily overloaded tire is made to run for two weeks
straight over a rotating pulley, a run equivalent to 10,-
000 or 15,000 miles of wear. On the surface of each
of the pulley wheels are two cleats mounted diagonally
and projecting about an inch from the surface of the
wheels. The tire thus hits two bumps for each revolu-
tion of the pulley wheel.
The tests are necessarily supplementary to actual
road tests which give more representative test results
by taking account of all the factors actually met in
practice.
Normandie
The largest ship now afloat is the Normandie, new
French C.G.T. liner, which was launched on October


29th. This ship, till re-
cently known as the T.6.,
is a quadruple-screw turbo-
electric mail and passenger
ship; and its dimensions
make it the greatest unit
that moves on earth. It has
an overall length of 1027
feet, a breadth at the prom-
enade deck of 119 feet, and
a height from keel to chart-
room of 128 feet. Five of
its eleven decks run con-
tinuously throughout the
full length of the ship, and
ten elevators are installed.
The gross tonnage is ap-
proximately 75,000 tons, and 160,000 horsepower of
propelling capacity will drive the ship at a speed of
34.54 miles per hour. At this speed the ship is prepared
to make the voyage from Havre, France to New York
via Plymouth in under five days regardless of weather
conditions. There is room for 2170 passengers and the
crew totals 1320.
Steam at 660° F., 440 Ibs. pressure is generated in
oil-fired water tube boilers, and is led through four
steam turbines, each of 34,200 kw. capacity at 2430
R.P.M. The steam turbines drive four three-phase
alternators rated at 33,400 kw. at 5500-6000 volts. The
power thus generated is led to four main electric pro-
pulsion motors of the synchronous type, each of 40,-
000 horsepower calcity, a total of 160,000 horse-

Attention Grads
Who's Where among
Michigan Engineers
The Campus As It Is
Greetings, Alumni:
Well, this is the season of the year for all sorts of
good cheer and good tidings from all your friends.
This month we hope to be able to print a good fat
notes section as sort of a Christmas gift to all of
you "Alums" and the cooperation of a good percent-
age of you has made this possible. We'd like to
give special thanks to those of you who have re-
sponded so obligingly to our appeal for more news.
As I have said before, Santa Clans has crashed
through with a stack of news that has warmed our
hearts and the only thing that worries us now is
the fact that the boss will accuse us of trying to
monopolize the whole magazine. However, we'll
try to smooth it over with him. We'd like very
much to be able to print a section such as this every
month but it can only be possible with your aid. So
don't let that Christmas Spirit die down; send your
best wishes to all of your friends who have now
scattered themselves far and wide. Well, we can't
spend all day here talking about ourselves so it's
about time we tear open this mail and let out the
greetings.
1885
Our first greeting comes from away back when
Santa Claus used reindeers instead of aeroplanes.
It comes from an old friend who never forgets us
when Christmas rolls around. The person in mind
is Alexander E. Kastl, 17 Terrace, Pelham Manor,
New York. Mr. Kastl, a Civil Engineer of '85, is
now employed on the Board of Water Supply, New
York, and his office is in the Municipal Building.
1897
F. A. Ketcham, another oldtimer, sends us a note
from New Rochelle. Mr. Ketcham, it seems, is at
present employed as president of The Graybar
Electric Co., 420 Lexington Ave., New York City.
His private mailing address is 166 Valley Road.
New Rochelle.
1898
Not to be outdone, C. E. Groesbeck, '98. sends us
his regards as well as a little information. He is
now the President of the Electric Bond and Share
Co., 2 Rector St., New York. His residential ad-
dress is 375 Park Ave. Drop around and see him
you New Yorkers, even if it's only to say, 'Merry
Christmas'.
1905
The Zahorsky Co. Inc., 231 West 18th Street,
Sound Beach, Connecticut, informs us that Charles
Houston, whom you '05'ers well remember, is now
Vice-President of the concern. Mr. Houston resides
in the same city.
1906
Amidst all the excitement of the coming events
during this time of seasonal festivities, George S.
Fanning obligingly takes time out to inform us of
his present situation. He is employed as Chief
Engineer of the Erie Railroad, New Jersey. He re-
sides at 222 Howard Street, Passiac, New Jersey.
1907
Here is a person well known to all you Alums.
It is none other than Mason Rumney, the former
President of the Alumni Association of the Uni-
versity. Why, sure you all remember him, but still
you don't seem to write. Is it his address you
want? Here it is—305 University Place, Grosse
Pointe Village, Michigan. Mr. Rumney holds the
Vice Presidency of the Detroit Steel Products Co.
Here's quite a coincidence. Along with Mr. Rum-
ney's letter, we hear from Don J. Hastings, who is
the new President of the Alumni Association. Mr.
Hastings also holds an executive position. He is
President of the Twin Flex Corp., Detroit. His ad-
dress is 1465 Boston Blvd., in the same city.
A very friendly note comes from Edwin VanDor-
en Wallace, who is now living at 850 Frelingheuy-
sen ave., Newark, New Jersey. His current occu-
pation is that of Sales Engineer of the Carrier
Engineering Corporation.
And still another graduate of '07 writes to us.

Chemical Department. His time is now
occupied by the Huron Portland Cement
Co., of Detroit, Michigan, as General
Sales Manager.
1909
R-r-rip! There goes the letter and
here's the note. Harold Benjamin Wood-
cock, is occupied as Vice-President of the
National Surety Co., 115 Broadway, New
York.
1911
Here's one for the 'Chem' department. Dr. Albert
B. Newman (just plain 'AT to you of '11) is now
Professor of Chemical Engineering in the depart-
ment of Chemical Engineering of Cooper Union, lo-
cated in New York. Mr. Newman, you remember,
acquired his Ph.D. in 1928. He'll certainly be glad
to hear from his former classmates, so drop a line
to 61 West 9th Street, New York.
1917
Another New York greeting is received; this time
it is from Norman T. Bolles of 131 West 87th Street.
He reigns supreme as the President of the Indian
Motorcycle Co., of New York.
Meade W. Patterson, also of '17, sends a very
pleasing note. He tells us that he spends most
of his time as Superintendent of the Bridgeport
Brass Co. He also reminds us that his address is
29 Senior Place, Bridgeport, Connecticut.
1918
The Civil Engineering Department is now repre-
sented by Howard W. Reindel, '18. Many of you
will remember him for his work as Secretary of the
Engineering Council in 1918. Howard informs us
that at present he is in the employ of the Detroit
Desk Co., Detroit, as Manufacturers Representative.
Nicholas Brazzell, also of '18, mails us a very in-
teresting note from 1 Prospect Park, West Brook-
lyn. Mr. Brazzell is devoting his time to the pleas-
urable occupation of Naval Architecture, with his
business offices at 225 Broadway, in the same city.
1921
Battle Creek, Michigan, does its bit in keeping up
this column, as Herbert E. Smith, M.E. '21, sends a
cheery "Hello" and "Howdy". But that isn't all.
Mr. Smith, it appears, is occupied as Standards En-
gineer of the General Foods Corp., at Battle Creek.
Furthermore, he is in the Postum Division of the
above company. His residence is 124 North Broad
Street. Battle Creek.

The Campus as it used to be.
1922
Do you remember the Business Manager of the
Technic of 1921? You're right. It's our own Mil-
ton A. Goetz, and here's a letter from him. In ad-
dition to offering his best wishes, Mr. Goetz tells us
that he greatly enjoys his work with the Brooklyn
Edison Co. His position there is Assistant Test
Engineer in the Hudson Avenue Station.
Here we find another Grad of '22 in a relatively
new field. That is, it's new for us to put in these
brief chats. R. N. Dubois is the person, and his
work is Research Engineering on Diesel Engines.
In this endeavor, he is employed by the Continental
Motors Corporation of Detroit.
1925
J. S. Richardson, Ch.E. '25, living at 29/4 Glendalc
Avenue, Detroit, informs us that he is now in the
employ of the James Vernor Co., manufacturers of
ginger ale. He has charge of Plant operations and
general outdoor advertising.
1929
A recent note from Bernard Cain, '29, states that
he has just been transferred to the Engineering
General Department of the General Electric Co.,
Schenectady, N.Y. He previously had spent a few
weeks in the New York offices of the company.
1930
At the same time we also learned of the transfer
of Richard Furniss, from the Testing Department
of the General Electric Co., at Schenectady, to the
Philadelphia works of the same company.
1931
To conclude this friendly chat, we have a letter
which glows with all the warmth of Yuletide greet-
ings. It comes from Mr. Kenneth L. Rohrbach,
who gained his M.S. in Chemical Engineering in
1931. The American Steel and Wire Company of
Worcester, Massachusetts, has acquired Mr. Rohr-
bach's services. He is now in charge of their newly
started work of Insulation Research. o
Well, best wishes, Alumni. We'll be back with
von after the Xmas festivities.

"Look here,
Brother!
Something
New!"
"Stresses and Strains" of The Tectonic, or what
have you, presents for the first time in the history of
Civilization, a page of idiosyncrasies that will positively
guarantee to give you that disgusted Monday morning
feeling any time you may happen to read this garbage.
We will endeavor to bring to each and every one of you
each and every month of the school year, the worst
possible reading matter that can be gathered together
in one pile. We hereby in this twelfth month of the
year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-two give
you warning to read no more of this page. o
Rough on Rats
Inquitous experiments are being performed under our
very noses, so to speak, and we smell nothing. Three
rats were recently sent to a horrible death last Thurs-
day in the Animal Testing laboratories and no one
seemed to care. How would you feel, if you were more
(if a rat than you are, to have a couple of ignorant
medics lay hands on you, and put you through a series
of tortures, to which those of Medieval Spain, even,
could not compare, just to satisfy their curiosity?
The details of the experiment are exceedingly grue-
some. The rats named Oswald, Percival and Pedro,
are known as highly honorable and reputable rats in
Ann Arbor Rodent society; and at the time of their
capture they were innocently enjoying themselves over
the remains of a pint of whiskey (or was it pink lemon-
ade), which they had found in the closet of a well
known Sorority (name on request). They had ar-
rived at the silly stage when two lovely but lowly
women medics, who were also in the silly stage, (natu-
ral state), pounced upon them and carried them off to
their dens amid the loud protests of Messrs. Percival,
(Jswald, and Pedro. Now I ask you, How would you
like to be that rat?
The next day, a series of experiments were instituted
on our poor friends. They were each compelled to eat
in quick succession various issues of recent humor
magazines such as "Alley Boo" "Slat Kick" and "Prof.
Novell's Generating Stations"; publications for which
we cannot show sufficient contempt. Issue after issue

of the first two publications were crammed down their
throats until ()swald. the weakest of the three de-
veloped convulsions on the three thousand one hundred
and fifty-seventh issue, and thereafter quietly passed
away while trying to digest some of the so-called hu-
mor. Pedro waded through "Generating Stations"
most valiantly until he digested a transformer which
quite naturally transformed him from a terrestrial ro-
dent to a celestial one, if such there be. Percival. the
strongest successfully digested this volume but his loss
of weight from the process was found to be 706,293.-
090001 milligrams. Oh yes, he died of insomnia two
days later. The disease was said to be the result of
poorly digested circular-mil-miles.
It was a sad affair. Just two minutes after their
life on this earth had expired, Dean Bursley rushed in
with a bottle of pluto water. "Fellow Engineers," he
cried, "will we stand for this?" "I'll say we won't,
lets turn out the lights and go to sleep." o
The War Cry is On
"We want Beer." This slogan stands behind a very
worthy cause but there is a cause that is still more
worthy. That cause is wider distribution of the "Stresses
and Strains". We of the staff will in our undying
effort endeavor to place in each and every Sorority.
League House, Dormitory and rest room, a copy if not
two copies of "Stresses and Strains". What we need
is your help. Will not some Philanthropist donate
enough dough to carry out the project? We will men-
tion no names. One great man has thought of the
fraternities, but why snob the women. Yes. why not:
Xigh on to 40 million copies of the issue are distrib-
uted to men students. Should not your date be able
to talk intelligently to you about the worth while
policies of this great organization? The battle is on.
Will you help? All we want is your cash, check, and
money order. Please refrain from sending check.-,
which will return to us marked no money or no bank.
Dog Sleeps in Lecture
Dogs also sleep in lectures as was proven last month.
A dog resembling a horse in size had stretched him-
self across the entrance to a lecture room and was
sleeping peacefully. There was no getting around that.

EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITY
(Continued from page 9)
group) meetings and here speech methods and prac-
tices are expounded by faculty men.
Frequently inter-group competition is arranged be-
tween the smaller groups. The men who show most
promise here are chosen to go to work in an advanced
training group where more advanced speech problems
such as logic and sales psychology are taken up. From
this group men are selected to participate in inter-chap-
ter work and to fill speaking engagements. Throughout
the entire organization the motivating idea is to keep
everyone practicing and improving.
As these men practice speech work they must do cer-
tain things and acquire abilities which take them be-
yond technical engineering problems. They are made
to tell stories in competition. They must debate, give
eulogistic speeches, present sales talks. In doing so
they are forced to connect their engineering work with
the outside world and its other phases, they are forced
to look up information on many subjects, they find it
necessary to weigh evidence, they must arrange their
case logically, and finally, they must convey the idea to
others.
In talking about a state or national issue a man must
find information about both engineering and economic
phases. He learns to use a library. How many en-
gineer's can go to a library and use the indexes there
in the correct manner? The Engineering Index is one
of the most valuable yet least used books in our tech-
nical libraries. Not only from libraries, but from in-
terviews, government reports, and questionnaires the
Sigma Rho Tan man learns to extract otherwise un-
available evidence. Thus the engineer learns by prac-
tice to locate evidence and material on any subject.
Next, the speech man must weigh and arrange his
evidence. He learns that some evidence is worth more
than some other and that he must get at the important
issues. He will learn that where the building of a new
sewer is being held up by lack of funds, it will
do him no good to point out that the construction of
that sewer is technically possible and desirable. He
learns that to make the average man understand the
situation which is so clear to him, he must recover the
ground and make the presentation of it in such a man-
ner that the average man is not confused by it. He
learns to make a proof complete.
In presenting evidence to people, the engineer will
soon learn that an uninformed group of people reason
primarily by emotion, a fact which the lawyer knows so
well. He learns that peculiar mob psychology which
has made the mass of people plastic clay in the hands
of the proper artist, be he an Antony at the bier of a
Caesar or a Franklin Roosevelt cleverly outsmarting
an intelligent foe. He is made to realize that along
with engineering facts, the engineer must have the
ability to make people see those facts.

the men who have taken up its work and perservered
in it, is shown by the record of the society. Teams
from the Michigan Engineering College have twice met
Literary College teams of varsity caliber and have
emerged victorious in each case. A member from the
same group last year won the University of Michigan
Oratorical Contest. Inter-chapter debates have aroused
much interest in engineering circles and have been of a
very high caliber.
For these reasons it is evident that extra-qurricular
speech training in our engineering colleges is one of
the best methods of giving to our engineering students
that extra training which they are going to be so in need
of when they emerge to meet the conditions of the
present industrial age. It trains him to tackle prob-
lems outside engineering with confidence, to realize how
closely engineering is bound to other arts and sciences,
and to talk up along with the politician and the lawyer.
BAILMENTS
(Continued from page 10)
mon law places the entire burden of insurance charges
upon the bailee. However, if the bailee does not take
out insurance, he may protect himself merely by the
use of due care.
Conditional Sales
To distinguish a bailment from a sale often brings up
some interesting issues. The delivery of goods to a
factory for manufacture into a finished product pre-
sents the question of whether a bailment or sale has
been effected. Numerous cases in this connection arise
where wheat is furnished to a mill for flour. The mill
may be burned or pass through bankruptcy before the
flour is returned to the farmer. If the transaction is
a sale, the farmer has a right to the flour; if it is a
bailment he has a right to reclaim the wheat as his
own, since the miller was a mere bailee. The test ap-
pears to rest on the intent of the parties. If the miller
should propose to grind the specific wheat for the
farmer, taking his fee in flour, the transaction is a
bailment. However, if the miller accepts and stores
the wheat, paying back out of his general stock of
flour, the transaction is generally held to be a sale. The
farmer must then join with the other creditors of the
miller.
The manufacturing field presents a problem directly
along this line. In fact, it is developing into a rather
common controversy since modern industry has turned
to specialty shops and assembly plants. Arnott vs Kan-
sas Pacific R. R. Co., 19 Kansas 95, is a case in point.
The railroad sent its old rails to the rolling mill to be
rerolled into new rails. The rolling mill was to add
such additional material as was necessary to replace
metal worn off the heads of the rail. The great bulk
of the material was furnished by the railroad, and the
transaction was held to be a bailment. The addition

of a small amount of material is treated as a mere ac-
cessory and does not itself change the transaction to
a sale. Of course, it is easy to think of cases where
the manufacturer would furnish the bulk of the
material, thereby creating a sale. If a conditional sale
contract has a clause which obligates the buyer to buy,
then it is logical that the seller must be obligated to
sell. This type of transaction is distinctly a sale. When
a bailment is established, that relationship may con-
tinue indefinitely even though the goods are not re-
turned at the end of the agreed period of the bailment.
Adverse possession will not start to run during the
period of the bailment. The bailee, for instance, can-
not claim title to the goods after a certain period
of time if there has not been some legal step taken to
end the relationship. This is particularly in point in
the matter of securities pledged for a loan. If the
goods are held for a specific purpose, the bailment will
end upon the accomplishment of that purpose. Again,
if the bailor demands re-delivery and the bailee refuses,
the bailment ceases.

terested in reducing all sorts of body noises by the use
of various sound deadening materials in the form of
spray treatments, the use of board and other "anti-
swish" material as it is called. He has also been in-
strumental in reducing tire and wind noises. All these
have been looked upon as important accomplishments
in the automobile industry.
We feel that it is quite unnecessary to point out cer-
tain characteristics in Mr. Paton after reading of his
accomplishments, for it is not hard to see that he has
always attempted to be one of the pioneers in anything
he wanted to do. He worked with the early automo-
bile and airplane. He interested himself in electricity
when it was still a rather young field. He was among
the first to do real experimental work on the Diesel
engine and now he is interested in the new field of
reduction of body noise in the automobile. His career
has been marked by the ability to solve rapidly and
surely problems set before him with the result that his
advancement has been phenomenally rapid.
He is married and has a daughter Eleanore. who is

We're sure that we have the permission of all the
alumni to express the hope that Mr. Paton will con-
tinue to succeed in the future as he has in the past.
As for ourselves, we want to tell all of you to keep your
eyes on Mr. Clyde R. Paton, who, being only thirty-
eight years of age, is due to surprise you for a long
time to come with the results of his pioneering research
work.
STRESSES AND STRAINS
(Continued from page 20)
By reason of resonance several if not all of the pupils
were put to sleep. The snoring became more and more
exactly the same period of amplitude as that of a sound-
ing tube in the front of the room. A terrific noise be-
gan to resound throughout the building and by noon the
noise had reached the stage where it could be heard all
over the campus. By some strange coincidence it
seemed to echo "Vote State Street." So by sheer fate
State Street won the elections. What a dog!
Students Crow Cigarette Tree
Who said the Engineers see nothing but the technical
side of life. Positive evidence to refute this belief
comes in the report that a cigarette tree has been cul-
tivated just outside the south entrance of West En-
gineering Building. The student efforts of the last
score of generations has taken root. Millions upon
millions of snipes have been very carefully placed at
this point. It has been definitely proven that a plant is
now growing there, despite the discredit of our friends
in the Forestry department who claim it to be a milk-
weed. If anything it is sour grapes. They refuse to
believe that engineers can produce that parched cigar-
ette from nature in the raw. With the super-fine in-
struments of the research department it has been proven
that this tree is growing at the rate of .2345 millimeters
per year. If this encouraging progress is continued we
will in a very few months be able to pluck our favorite
brand from this tree. The "Stresses and Strains" spon-
soring this development has scored another signal vic-
tory.
COLLEGE NOTES
(Continued from page 11)
Abraham Lincoln then president and his close friend
Joseph Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institute
and the nation's leading physicist of the time, were the
chief forces back of a movement to form such a body.
The Academy was officially formed by an act of the
Congress in 1863.
Among the present members of the Academy we
have four from the University of Michigan faculty
staff, namely: Professors Heber D. Curtiss, astronomy:
Walter B. Pillsbury, psychologist; Moses Gomberg.
chemist; and F. G. Novy, bacteriologist. The mem-

Subjects discussed and papers presented during the
three day session which lasted from November 14
to noon November 16 inclusive, covered a territory from
minute electrons to distant star clusters; and from the
probability that sleep is a hardening of proteins to the
possibility that a newly discovered intercellular com-
municating system will reveal the nature of the nerve
impulse. Discussion on the development of the Milli-
kan theory and a lecture on "A Geographic Study of
Cosmic Rays" were among those that headed the pro-
gram. Several of our own faculty members partici-
pated in the session and presented some interesting
papers.
This session being opened to the public gave the
studentry of the University an excellent opportunity
to hear and to witness some of the country's leading
scientists. Discussions varied as they were, lapping
over into almost every known field, were of extraordi-
nary interest even to the laymen.
The session was opened on Monday morning in the
Alumnae Room of the Women's League with President
Alexander G. Ruthven making an address of welcome
to which Dr. William Wallace Campbell, a Michigan
Alumnus and the president of the Academy responded.
The discussion and illustrated talks which followed, each
of about fifteen minutes duration were then held in the
Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre. Fifty-seven papers were
presented during this session.

The Fall initiation banquet of Tau Beta Pi, honorary
engineering fraternity, was held at the Union on
Wednesday evening, November 9. Nineteen initiates,
including seventeen seniors and two juniors, were se-
lected to uphold the standards of this, one of the most
important of the national honorary societies.
The inimitable Professor A. D. Moore acted as a
toastmaster for the evening, in which capacity he more
than lived up to his reputation. Richard X. Cogger
welcomed the initiates while Earl C. Briggs, one of the
neophites, responded. Mr. C. L. Spencer, Chief En-
gineer of the Interstate Commerce on Railroads was the
main speaker of the evening. In his speech he stressed
the promotion of fellowship among the Tau Beta Pi
men.
On Friday, November 18, the annual formal dance
was held in the League. The dance, through the ef-
forts of brothers Humphrey and Squibb turned out
to be a very pleasant party for the initiates.
The nineteen men who were initiated are as follows:
Seniors: Earl C. Briggs, Wayburn Dodge, Allister
Mitchel, Cornie Van Dis, George Atkinson, Leland
Morse, William Fader Jr., De Forest Eveland, Richard
F. Becker, John H. Benjamin, James G. Bruinooge,
Bryce L. Carter, Delmer G. Garrison, Jerry M. Gruitch,
Irvin J. Sattinger, Victor Matualitis and Wayne Mac

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, at
present one of the largest national societies, was or-
ganized in 1880 in the city of New York, with its
purpose the promotion of arts and sciences as applied
to engineering and mechanical construction. Among
the founders of the organization were professional and
technical men of prominence, professors and teachers
in technical schools and colleges, manufacturers and
many others interested in that field of engineering.
A few years ago a student branch was organized here
on the campus and the response by the Mechanical stu-
dents soon made success evident. The national organi-
zation is made up of five distinct classes of membership

and this student branch comes under one of them. In
the past the organization has been quite active in the
affairs of the Engineering School.
This year the organization held its initial meeting in
the West Engineering building and about sixty men at-
tended. Professors H. C. Anderson and R. S. Hawley
addressed the group, explaining to the new members the
society's functions and aims. Many interesting plans
are now held in view so that the coming year shall af-
ford the members some educating experiences.

Lake Inverness, a foot of snow and biting cold
weather, ushered in the initiation of Pi Tau Pi Sigma,
Honorary Signal Corps Fraternity, on the afternoon
of November 19. Prof. Briar's cottage was guarded
to the ''n—th" degree by the pledges who walked post
until nearly frozen.
After a "warming-up" in the cottage, the formal
initiation and banquet were held in the evening at the
Inverness Country Club. Prof. Briar gave an inter-
esting talk on "Pyrotechnics" and Captain Powell
obliged with a few remarks in his own inimitable
manner.
The men initiated were as follows: A. L. Beach.

Applied Mechanics Colloquium
The function of the Colloquium is to bring to-
gether periodically students and the faculty for informal
discussions of problems in the broad field of Applied
Mechanics. At these meetings recent articles which
have appeared in the literature are briefly reviewed.
The main paper of the evening is usually presented by
one of the members of the colloquium. On various oc-
casions throughout the year, prominent engineers of this
country and abroad are entertained. Recently Profes-
sor R. V. Southwell of Oxford, England made a visit
during which he discussed methods used in English
Colleges for teaching engineering.

A close-up

tensometer

THE imlxirtance of experimentation in the field
of Mechanics cannot be over-emphasized. The
development of any science must be hased upon
certain natural laws, which can he established only by
means of experiments. A relatively few experimental-
ly determined laws form the basis for the science of
mechanics. . Upon these laws as a framework, the sci-
ence, in its present form, has been
built. Progress in mechanics may
be impeded or inspired, depending
upon the pertinent developments in
other fields.
It is generally recognized that
Newton's three laws of motion form
the basis for statics and dynamics.
Hooke's law, an experimental fact,
forms the foundation for the theory
of elasticity or strength and behavior
of materials. Coulomb's laws of
friction had first to be estabbshed
before any theory of friction could
be formulated. Newton's law of
gravitational attraction is a fact,
which had to be established experi-
mentally. Some of the basic laws of mechanics are so
fundamental as to be almost axiomatic. Such for
example is the law of conservation of energy, or Ber-
nouilli's Theorem in the study of hydromechanics. An-
other example is the law of superposition used in
strength of materials. All these fundamental laws per-
taining to any science must be established and formu-
lated by experimental evidence before that science can
begin to be rationally developed.
Once a fundamental law has been established and
formulated, we may then by various steps of rationaliza-
tion begin to expand the science and make predictions
regarding expected results under a new combination of
circumstances. During this stage in the development
of a science, experimentation plays an important part
in checking the theory upon which we base the pre-
dictions. Also since the actual conditions of nature
are always complex, they never agree entirely with the
simplified ideal conditions which are frequently as-
sumed in the formulation of the fundamental laws.
Experiments then play an important part in evaluating
the effect of certain conditions not taken into account
in the formulation of the basic laws. Thus new laws
Because it is believed that
laboratory work helps to de-
velop a better understanding of
the various courses in mechan-
ics, a course in Experimental
Dynamics is offered to the stu-
dents of the University of
Michigan to augment the ana-
lytical work presented in the
class room. This article shows
the advantages to be derived
from such experimental work,
and describes briefly the elec-
tive courses offered in this par-
ticular field.—The Editor.
may be established, which can again be used in evalu-
ating the effect of still other factors, by experiment.
In this way the science is gradually built up step by step.
Sometimes development may be arrested for some
time, until discoveries in some other field makes pos-
sible the devising of some instrument for measuring
an effect, which perhaps could not hitherto be measured.
In this way discoveries in electricity
have aided advancement in other
fields, particularly in mechanics.
For example, electrical strain meas-
uring devices have made possible
determinations of stress behavior,
which otherwise could not have
been made.
Sometimes the effects of certain
factors in nature are so complex
that they cannot be formulated into
simple laws. In these cases ex-
periments prove very valuable in
obtaining emperical coefficients for
formulas, which are set up ration-
ally 'from the basic laws. In this
way the laws are adjusted to give
good results, at least over the limited range of the ex-
periments upon which they are based. The laws
governing the flow of liquids nearly always have to
be adjusted in this way. The science of hydraulics
rests so heavily upon this type of experiment that it
is often referred to as an emperical science. Experi-
ments of this kind must be conducted with extreme
care, to separate the effects of the various factors in-
volved. Formulae based upon them must be used with
extreme care, to insure that they are applied only to
similar conditions. The exterpolation of laws deter-
mined only over a limited range of experimental evi-
dence is always dangerous, as it may lead to entirely
erroneous conclusions.
Dynamics represents a very good example of a sci-
ence, which had its development delayed because of
insufficient progress in other fields. In this case the
requirement was an instrument for accurately measur-
ing time. To ascertain the laws governing the motion
of a body, careful measurement of time was essential.
The present day watch and pendulum clock, however,
are comparatively recent developments.

ir


Dynamic Balancing and Testing Machine
the time of Galileo (1642), who was the first to es-
tablish the fundamental laws of this science. His
experiments with falling bodies from the Tower of
Pisa are well known. He was the first to discover the
three laws of motion, which were later formulated by
Sir Isaac Newton and bear his name. Galileo had no
refined instruments for measuring time, but succeeded,
nevertheless, to obtain a value for the acceleration of
a freely falling body which is still used today. The
difficulties encountered by Galileo and his painstaking
care and ingenuity in overcoming them should prove
an inspiration to any experimenter today with the re-
fined instruments which he has at his command.
For the student in Mechanics who really wishes to
have a keen appreciation of the science, the oppor-
tunity to do experimental work should prove welcome.
Because so much theory has already been established
by experiment it may not seem necessary for one be-
ginning a study of the subject to do much experiment-
ing. The laws have already been set up for him and
he must learn first what has been done, before trying
to do more. As a result of this there is perhaps in
our curricula a tendency to overemphasize the analyti-
cal side of our mechanics and underemphasize the
physical side. Too often the student gains proficiency
in manipulating the mathematical laws of mechanics,
without a very clear idea of how these laws were de-
termined. This may be all right when the object is
simply to obtain results, but if the objective is to have
a clear understanding of the subject, then the basic
principles must be clearly understood. Working with
models and physical bodies in the laboratory tends to
produce a greater sense of physical reality, and should
stimulate interest in the subject. Here no better adage
can be used than "seeing is believing."
In the last few years, at the University of Michi-
gan, a one hour laboratory course in this field has been
developed with a view to giving the student a better
physical conception of the subject of dynamics. The
aim in presenting this course has been to allow the
student an opportunity, from week to week, to work
with and see experimental verification of the theory
which he learns in the class room. No attempt is
made to discover new laws or principles but simply
to see how the ones already established were, or may
be, arrived at. Since experimentation is an essen-
tial step in the development of a science, it seems
that it should be an equally important step in gain-
ing an understanding of it.
Much of the equipment in the laboratory is
"home-made" and rather crude. The most delicate
and refined instruments are not always used for
taking measurements. This fact, however, should
encourage, rather than discourage, careful labora-
tory technique. There is more credit—and much
more practical benefit—in having to use some in-
genuity in getting good results with poor instru-
ments than having precise instruments always at hand.
In this manner resourcefulness is most certainly to be
stimulated and its value cannot be denied. Then too
because the models are simply constructed, attention
from the essential features is not distracted by super-
fluous parts. The relationship between the physical
problem and the theoretical treatment of it is more
clearly seen.
The first experiment which the student makes is a
determination of acceleration produced by gravity on
a freely falling body. If he does not obtain as good
results as Galileo obtained, he will at least begin to
appreciate some of the difficulties involved. As a sec-
ond experiment he will determine the effect of friction
on a body, moving under the influence of gravity. In
this way he uses one previously established fact to
isolate and determine the effect of another. By such
procedure an idea is conceived of the manner in which
the science is built up, step by step.

By Professor Walter C. Sadler
ADVERSE possession is a means of transferring
ownership of land without the express consent
if the previous owner. It is based upon the
theory of a "lost grant". That is, the new owner of
the land has been in possession so long that he is con-
clusively presumed to have received a regular grant
or deed to the tract, and to have lost the papers. For
centuries the law has looked with considerable favor
upon the doctrine of adverse possession, as it has a
tendency to fix titles, and to discourage the trumping up
of questionable claims to cast clouds on established
ownership.
The Michigan statutes are typical of the American
law as to procedure. Adverse possession is handled in
the Judicature Act under the heading "statute of limi-
tations". It states that no one shall bring an action to
recover land or make an entry thereon if a certain
term of years has passed since the accrual of the right
of action. For example, if a stranger enters upon Mc-
Kay's vacant land and treats it as his own, McKay has
an immediate right of action in ejectment to oust the
intruder. But if McKay is guilty of laches, that is,
if he sleeps on his rights for the period of limitation,
he is forever barred from suing for the recovery of
the land or entering upon the property.
The actual term of years varies in the different
states, and even varies within the individual states de-
pending upon the circumstances of the case. Thus in
Michigan, if the intruder has a defective claim of title
based upon a foreclosure suit, a sheriff's sale, a long
time will, or a court decree, the statute will bar the
true owner after adverse possession for five years. If
the intruder claims under a defective grant from the
United States or the State, the period is ten years,
while in all other cases, it is fifteen years.
The success of the use of adverse possession depends
to a great extent upon the possession itself. It is
rather universally accepted that this possession must be
adverse and hostile to the true owner; it must be con-
tinuous and uninterrupted for the statutory period, it
must be actual, visible and notorious and it must be
exclusive. It will be noted that such a possession is
characteristic of that of a true owner and is merely sup-
porting the legal fiction that the intruder is the true
owner and has lost his grant to the property. Judicial
interpretation of these clauses gives rise to the varying
rules found in the different jurisdictions.
To begin with, the intruder must have actually as-
sumed possession. This is brought out in the case of
John Widdicomb Co. vs Card, 218 Mich. 72, 187 N. W.
308 where the claimant based his title on a void tax-

Possession of this spot would gladden any "squatter's" heart
deed of many years standing. He had not been in posses-
sion of the land and the true owner had no grounds
for action until the claimant had actually entered upon
the property. In other words, the void tax deed of
itself would never give rise to a claim of adverse
posession.
The intruder's possession must be adverse and hos-
tile to the claims of the true owner. This was the is-
sue in the recent case of City of Grand Rapids vs
Pere Marquette Railway Co., 248 Mich. 686; 227 N.
W. 797. The property in question belonged to the
City of Grand Rapids. The city had given permission
to the builder, a grantee of the railroad, to build the
siding. The original transaction was a simple license.
The evidence showed no instances of the licensee deny-
ing the license and setting up a possession open and
hostile to the city. The decision was for the city. Ten-
ants are not allowed to set up adverse possession after
they have remained on the property as mere holdover
occupants without payment of rents. In Jasper Town-
ship vs Martin, 161 Mich. 336; 126 N. W. 437 the
township had taken a small tract of land as a site for
the townhall. The transaction was based upon a lease,
void for want of signature. The township had paid
rent at intermittent times but suddenly attempted to
claim title to the land based upon thirty-nine years of
continuous use. They alleged that since their lease
was void because of lack of signature they were hold-
ing the land adversely to the owner. The court held
that the possession was not adverse, but permissive
in its nature, and that it could never ripen into a title
by adverse possession. Other cases might be cited
where the possession is held non-hostile, as in the mat-
ter of trustees, mortgagors, or tenants in common who
have attempted to claim adverse possession after long
periods of possession.
The intruder must be in continuous and uninterrupted
possession. This rule is consistent with the theory of

f^^O motor minded people the holiday period means
I not only the usual routine of gay events but also
the serious business of previewing the auto manu-
facturers' latest models. A more serious and scrutin-
izing previewing than ever before has begun and the
blankets of fine advertising will be removed in order
that Mr. Prospective Buyer can say to himself, "I have
matched my dollar's value." For all this the manufac-
turer has prepared himself and his product.
Chevrolet, a consistent leader in volume sales, in-
troduced its new, much more smartly designed models
in the middle of December. Conventional streamlining
through the bulk of the body with definite tendencies
towards tear-drop design in the front and rear-end
have added much to its slender rakish beauty. Skirted
fenders and an extended rear body panel have screened
from vision the ugly lines of frame structure and have
made the care more than a momentary delight to the
eye.
A lengthened stroke has stepped the speed up to a
maximum well over 70 m.p.h., and has increased the
horsepower rating to a maximum of 65 at 2800 r.p.m.
Innovations are numerous and are decidedly marked
advances in the automotive engineering field. Outstand-
ing among the new features is the "Cushion-balanced"
motor mounting or "stanamic balancer." The latter
name comes from the fact that the new mounting ef-
fectively dampens out all vibrations set up by both
static and dynamic residual forces. The engine rests
on a sub-frame with four points of support and the
whole of its weight is carried on the two lateral sup-
ports so located that the motor is balanced on its center
of gravity. The front and rear supports carry no en-

gine weight but function as stabilizers for the engine's
''fore and aft" pitch. In this position the engine rotates
about its own principal axis.
To improve the engine's operating performance there
are two notable achievements. A two way automatic
vacuum operated control on the distributor provides
accurate spark adjustment for all loads; and in order to
produce the proper combustible for firing regardless
of the grade of gasoline being used, the Chevro-
let engineers have developed and octane selector which
advances or retards the spark until the proper com-
bustion occurs within the chamber. An automatic
thermostat has been added to keep the engine at con-
stant temperature.
Buick
The less depressed of the motoring public in its
naturally conservative mood will view with pleasure
the Buick offerings for the current year. Although
there is nothing startlingly new about the product there
are enough improvements to allow the car to retain its
usual high esteem before all car owners. Adding dash
to its already graceful beauty appears to have been the
most notable achievement of its makers. By skirting
the fenders, slip-streaming the back panel and air-
stream styling the body from bumper to bumper, the
body designers have achieved the modern without being
extreme.

An increased tread and a lengthened wheelbase have
made it possible to lower the center of gravity a full
two inches thus improving reliability at higher speeds.
A five point power plant mounting insulated with rub-
ber grommets and pads has been developed along with
a cross reinforced frame to give the greatest degree of
engine smoothness with the necessary stability. New
automatic inertia type shock absorbers controlled by
floating valves actuated by the movement of the chassis
are claimed to maintain riding comfort over all roads
at high speed.
The automatic clutch, or "wizard control" introduced
last year, has been improved by the addition of a new
pendulum valve that automatically controls the engage-
ment of the clutch insuring smooth pick-up and in-
stantaneous change from free wheeling to conventional
drive. By employing ball detents instead of plungers,
the silent-second gear shifting arrangement has been
improved considerably. A starter button has replaced
the old style floor pedal and new headlights which direct
a beam on the right hand edge of the pavement have
been installed to replace the present standard single
beam lights.
Ever since the advent of closed
cars, motorists, in order to enjoy
fresh air have been obliged to endure
the discomforts of drafts blowing
upon them or to remain with win-
dows closed and endure the un-
healthfulness of stuffy air within
the car. A study of closed car vent-
ilation was made and Buick now of-
fers "no-draft ventilation." By
placing a pane of glass that is free
to be moved about a vertical axis at
the front of each side window gentle
currents of fresh air are continually
conduced within the car without
producing noticeable drafts. This
feature although detracting some-
what from the finished beauty of
the car. should be a helpful selling
factor.
Packard
This builder of the finer type of motor car transpor-
tation made internationally famous by its recent
achievement in supplying a successful power plant for
Gar Wood's ^liss America Xth, has scored another
impressive hit by presenting the most conservative
streamlined cars in the recent New York Auto Show,
the Eight, the Super Eight, and the Twin Six.
The Eight and the Super Eight have been stepped up
in horse power from 110 and 135 to 120 and 145 re-
spectively. . . the twin six develops 160 horsepower.
The mechanical factor largely responsible for this in-
creased power is the adoption of a new dual-downdraft
carburation system that gives all the advantages of two
separate carburators without the necessity of maintain-
ing finely balanced adjustments.
Another unique mechanical improvement on the new
Packards for 1933 is the application of the Bendix-BK
vacuum-operated power brake system, a braking system
that is positive in action, and when brakes are applied
for instant emergencies the driver does not experience
a swerving of the car—the drum pressure on all four
brake drums is evenly and automatically controlled.
In brief, other improvements added to this new group
are, three point engine mountings, more rigid connect-
ing rods with cooling fins, a better system of cylinder
lubrication, new mufflers with greater silence and less
back pressure, dual coils for positive ignition at high
speeds, improved syncro-mesh transmission with very
quiet operating gears at all four speeds, and lastly but
not of lesser importance is the greatly improved shock
absorber action which gives absolute ride control when
necessary on traveling over rough roads.

An alternating current vectometer
Alternating Current Vectometers
With a view to reducing routine mathematical acro-
hatics in the determination of alternating current quan-
tities, several unusual instruments have recently been
developed and built for use in adjusting commutating
field shunts on large a-c railway motors. On a vernier
dial, phase angles are read directly to a fraction of a
degree, and components and scalar quantities of cur-
rent and voltage are read directly from meters. The
impedances of the meters are such that their introduc-
tion into the circuits has a negligible effect on the dis-
tribution of current and voltage drops.
The vernier dial on which the phase angles are read
is connected to the rotor of a phase shifter, which has
a three-phase primary winding and a two-phase, four-
wire secondary balanced winding. By throwing from
the "in phase" to the "quadrature" position the switch
that is connected to the secondary, the standardizing
current is shifted 90°. In reading scalar quantities,
the difference between the successive dial readings
gives the phase displacement of the quantities.
The vectometer illustrates Kirchoff's law in com-
plicated networks, and facilitates ascertaining power
factor measurements ordinarily obtained through the
reading of volts, amperes, and watts and the subsequent
use of a slide rule in finding the power factor angle.
In connection with the study of the symmetrical com-
ponent of analyzing unbalanced polyphase conditions,
multiplication by j, a, and a2 can be performed simply
by rotating the phase shifter through the proper number
of degrees.
San Francisco-Oakland Bridge
Several records for size are being broken in connec-
tion with the loan recently authorized by the Recon-
struction Finance Corporation for the construction of
the San Francisco-Oakland Bridge, which is to be
started in February, 1933 and finished by January.
1938. The amount of the loan, $62,000,000, is the
largest which has yet been authorized by the RFC for
a self-liquidating project. The remainder of the $70,-
000,000 which is the estimated cost of the bridge will
be furnished by the state of California.
The dimensions and carrying capacity of the bridge
are also out of the ordinary. The preliminary design
of the bridge calls for two central spans on the deep
water side with an aggregate length of 9,000 feet. Each
span will be supported at the center by a huge con-
crete pier rising 300 feet out of the water, giving a
clearance for shipping of at least 214 feet. The total
length of the projected bridge will be about seven
miles, four and one-half of which will be over water.
The bridge is to be divided into two main parts by the
mid-bay island of Yerba Buena. If present plans arc
adhered to, the bridge will have two decks, one with
six lanes for fast traffic and the other with three lanes
for slower traffic. In addition, there will be either two
interurban tracks or two more truck lanes.
Enormous quantities of materials will be required
for the construction of this bridge. It is estimated that
170.000 tons of structural steel and wire, 20,000 tons
of reinforcing steel. 40,000.000 board feet of lumber,
1,000,000 barrels of cement, 1,000,000 cubic yards of
rock and gravel, and 200,000 gallons of paint will be
necessary for the construction work. Twelve thousand
men will be given jobs during the construction of the
bridge.
Under present conditions, San Francisco is separated
from Berkeley and Oakland by a bay which extends for
some distance past the two cities. Communication be-
tween San Francisco and these two important centers
may be by ferry across the bay or by automobile around
the bay in a long circuitous route. The bridge, which
has been contemplated for many years and is now in
the process of design, will provide a quicker and more
convenient route than has heretofore been possible.
When built, it will be maintained and operated by the
state of California.
Engineering Society Formed
Seven national engineering bodies have organized
the Engineers' Council for Professional Development
with the announced objective of advancing the pro-
fessional status of the engineer. The participating lxxlies
include the national societies of civil, mining and metal-
lurgical, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineers.

Rock Island Hydro-Electric Development
—Courtesy Military Engineer
as well as the Society for the Promotion of Engineer-
ing Education, and the National Council of State
Boards of Engineering Examiners.
This new agency plans to coordinate and promote
efforts directed toward higher professional standards.
Its immediate objective is the development of a sys-
tem whereby the progress of the young engineer to-
ward professional standing can be recognized by the
man himself, by the profession, and by the public
through the development of those qualifications which
render the engineer a valuable member of society. It
is believed that this will involve increased develop-
ment along social, economic and general cultural lines
as well as the maintenance of high technical standards
of education and practice.
The Engineers' Council for Professional Development
is embarking on a program of improving means for
educational guidance of young men with respect to the
engineering profession, the formulation of criteria for
colleges of engineering, the determination of a pro-
gram of personal and professional growth for young
engineering graduates and the formulation of methods
whereby engineers who have met suitable standards
may receive corresponding professional recognition.
Rock Island Hydroelectric Development
The initial development of the Rock Island hydro-
electric project on the upper Columbia River, started in
the winter of 1929-1930, is now completed. The pro-
ject represents the first step in the power development
of the main stream of the Columbia. At present the
installed capacity is 60,000 kilowatts, but the station
is designed for an ultimate capacity of 150,000 kilowatts
A Diesel-electric

under a normal head of 48 feet. The Rock Island plant
is at present the only large low head development in the
Northwest.
The Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Company, for
whom the power plant has been constructed, also has
other hydroelectric developments in other places. Most
of them, however, do not have appreciable storage
capacity, so that no water can be stored for periods of
low water. In order to provide continuous power
capacity, the company has recently constructed an 80,-
000 kilowatt steam plant. The Columbia River flow
is also much more steady and predictable than that of
most of the plants on the west slope of the Cascades,
so that the development will furnish a dependable and
fairly steady source of power.
The power generated at the Rock Island development
will be transmitted to the company's substations at
110.000 volts over lines which will cross the moun-
tains at favorable points. The original development
makes available about 480,000,000 kilowatt-hours, while
the ultimate installation will produce about 1,220.000,-
000 kilowatt-hours.

Progress of Diesel-Electric Traction
Interesting news items from all parts of the world
indicate that Diesel-electric traction is making rapid
progress. In Denmark, for instance, the Danish State
railway administration announces that all future loco-
motive requirements for the state railways are to be met
by Diesel-engined units and that no further steam
locomotives are to be ordered. As many as 277 large
Diesel-electric locomotives are now being built for
Russia. Siam, on the other side of the world, has
thirteen locomotives of this type in operation. The
Buenos Aires Great Southern in Argentina has con-
ducted successful trials of Diesel-electric trains and
is now extending this system. It has just placed an
order of four locomotives of 1,700 horsepower each, to
be used on its system.
In Germany, a radically stream-lined Diesel-electric
train has recently been put into service between Berlin
and Hamburg, which is capable of doing ninety miles
an hour. In our own country, an interesting applicn-

A Decayed Democracy
The most hopelessly futile attempts at controlling
student functions on the campus of the University of
Michigan hy the same sort of universal democracy as is
used in managing the affairs of our national govern-
ment has finally instituted demands for a new deal. From
all sides of the campus the barbs have been levelled
rather justly on that utterly useless group of boy poli-
ticians called the Student Council and agitation has
finally reached a serious enough vein to threaten the
life of this body. But the question is probably arising
in many serious minded students' thoughts as to whether
the dropping of the Student Council and the turning
over of its few meager functions to the Union under-
class committee will entirely solve the problem. The
real nature of the attack has not changed much through
the last several years and is actually not a specific
charge against any specific organization such as the
Student Council or Engineering Council itself. The
outcry is the wholly justified one against the entire
unwholesome setup of student politics. In past years,
its clear voice, raised above the muddled babblings
of so-called student leaders, has brought about a divorce
of the Union and the publication boards from the politi-
cal jamboree. But there is more to be done now before
it is stilled for good.
As one well known professor rather appropriately
puts it, "It has been interesting to be on the outside
looking in and watching the children playing about
with the deceits and treacheries of the really grown up
politicial world. But, frankly, it is more damaging to
their later usefullness as good citizens than anything
we could allow them to do for it destroys every bit of
their respect for public office." It is very soundly as-
serted that the most able men in the country do not
hold political office and would not consider entering
politics under present characteristics. And it is just as
true and much more easily proven that those organiza-
tions and activities which are carried on under student
election principles have always been the weakest and
most mis-managed on the campus. A good cleanup
seems imperative, does it not?
Class elections are the great farce comedy of the
fall term. Whoever heard of a class organizing and
doing anything? It has become so bad that it's almost
a sacrilege to speak of such a thing. Class officers
cost money to elect, to keep, and to publicize enough
to satisfy their vanities. Dues are assessed to try and
cover this but the wary student has finally come to
want something for his dollars and never pays. So
why in the world should we keep them? Let's pull
down the curtain on the last act and close the comedy
for keeps.
The Student Council, the Engineering Council, and
those few other committees and organizations which
are filled by student voting have long ago ceased to
accomplish enough to justify their further existences.
It has already been suggested that the few duties of the
Student Council could well be taken care of by the
underclass committee of the Union by expanding its
personnel somewhat and this view should certainly be
approved. The Union underclass committee is ad-
mirably suited to handle the routine duties of student
self government. Its members are all working for
advancement under merit system rules, are not con-
nected with political machinations in the least, and are
thus likely to be able, hard working, and conscientious.
And it is just as reasonable to suppose that a proper
organization of this committee would enable it to handle
all the details of student self-government now dis-
tributed among several groups, rotting away under the
politician's touch.
Politics on this campus with its resultant evils of
student overorganization and inefficiency must ulti-
mately go if the ideals of a successful student self-
government are to be realized. As long as student
offices are to be created solely for the satisfaction of
personal vanities and over-inflated egos and for the
collection of as much graft as is possible and are to be
filled by the office juggling childishness of psuedo poli-
ticians and B.M.O.C.'s in name but not in deed, the
disadvantages of student self-government will far out-
weigh its advantages. We can only hope that the agi-
tation which has been lately aroused will gather an
increment so strong that it will ultimately banish the
whole machinery of student politics and cut down the
number of "ego'' pages in the yearly Michiganensian.
Anyway its an idea worth backing.
ENGINEER, SUPPORT THE NEW DEAL!
Page Twelve
January, 1933
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


In spite of the fact that E. B. O. objected strenu-
ously to our November editorial, Open Book Exams,
we feel that on the whole it voiced the sentiment of
the Engineering College, for a good deal of favorable
comment was also received. Everyone knows that
E. B. O. is a memory student par excellence and natu-
rally would decry any revision which would make him
use his brains in place of his peerless memory. How-
ever, we should like to impress upon him, (for which
he will thank us in later life) that when he once gets
out in the engineering world, a memorized mass of
facts will not do him much good.
Engineering, in its most glorious and fullest sense,
is the conquering of new problems which arise from
day to day and here an excellent memory is not a great
help. As we emphasized in our previous article, the
college of today should make the student think and not
make him a memory parcel. As an example of a prob-
lem, new, yet already old, we have the present depres-
sion. A solution which recently has flamed across the
country's press and which already is in the mouths of
most the people is this magic word, Technocracy. Re-
gardless of the plan's feasibility or of its comprehensive-
ness, it has received nationwide thought and attention,
which is in itself a tribute to the engineers and scien-
tists who launched it. Do you suppose these men were
helped in conceiving this idea by the fact that they
learned by memory the formula for energy losses in
water mains or by memorizing the processes and
temperatures for manufacturing duralumin?
Speaking of duralumin makes us think of Ch.E. 1
and according to our line of reasoning, this course
would just about be eliminated under our Open Book
ILvain plan. How many times have you heard someone
"gripe" about "that memory course, Ch.E. 1"? It is
probably not amiss to remark here, that any high school
freshman of average intelligence could pass the course
as now presented in Ch.E. 1. Very little besides a
memory is required. Further, we can't help but men-
tion that courses of this type might just as well be
studied by correspondence or by merely reading the
book. Either of these methods gives one the necessary
information, and this information is enlarged on in the
class room to a very limited extent.
While admitting that Ch.E. 1 is an extreme example.
we wish to point out that all courses have this memory
element in them to a larger or smaller degree. We
will always remember the open book exam we had in
that "pipe" course. Hydraulics. (As you probably
know, pipe is used in its correct sense and should not
be interpreted in its slang sense.) Previously the class
had memorized formulas, applied them like robots and
were getting along famously. But this exam demanded
a comprehensive understanding of the subject and the
marks could only be found with the aid of a micro-
scope. Suppose the class had had closed book exams
all semester, had applied their formulas religiously and
had received good grades. Would they know their
subject? No! Let us think for ourselves and know
fundamentals, not formulas and memorized doggerel.
The Heritage of the Engineer
Which is the more important, the fostering of the
mind and the development of intellect or the utilization
of matter and the bending of natural forces to the will
of mankind? In either case engineering is lighting the
path and will continue to light the way of the coming
generation.
Engineering multiplies the means for the earlier re-
lief of the two kinds of darkness with which civilized
humanity is concerned, the physical absence of light
and the mental absence of knowledge.
Turning night into day at first seemed sacriligious
but is now accepted as something of everyday neces-
sity. The history of illumination is truly romantic,
the fiery coal, the torch of pitch, animal oil, the candle,
the coal oil lamp, natural and artificial gases, and suc-
cessive steps in electrical illumination marking the
acceleration of means of better lighting. Now, even
television causes little violent public agitation, so com-
pletely has the public come to accept and demand upon
the genius of the engineer. Now man utilizes his
lengthened day to dispel the fears of mental darkness,
to light his path of travel, to foster amusement, and to
extend the opportunities for education, commerce, and
social intercourse.
The dispelling of mental darkness which this has
made possible is even more vital to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. The use of "midnight oil" has
produced world leaders and most of the modern mira-
cles of engineering. But whither our way? More
production for comfort or more books for knowledge?
Perhaps more schools and fewer smokestacks, more
fine community edifices and fewer factories, more
leisure and more light, are the present needs of our
people. In any case, engineering talent must and will
aid in directing the tendencies of our time.
To the Engineer! To his rich heritage from the
labors of past generations and scientists, he adds his
contributions. He continues the work of forcing out-
ward the challenging barriers that separate Man's ef-
forts from the impossible.
The engineer is the master of the laws of nature.
On a solid foundation of mathematics and science hc
has reared the structure of civilization. He is the
great coordinator. He plans and directs the construc-
tion of projects representing the investment of millions
of dollars and the labor of thousands of men. He in-
vestigates with open mind and gets the facts before
making decisions. He plans with thoroughness and
builds with fiidelity.
But what do you think? Are you a proponent of an
advanced culture made possible by an engineering world
or are you a backer of science as the surest aid to com-
fortable living and happiness? Think almut it!

College Notes
Earl C. Briggs
It is written all over his physiognomy, from the
straight line set in his lips to the twinkle in his left
eye. It all spells just one thing, "Determination" with
a capital "D." Earl C. Briggs with his best Ann Arbor
manners strikes you just that way and you can't do
anything about it. We believe it is an unshakable out-
growth of his embosomed hatred for the opposite sex,
for the story goes that for the ungodly length of time
of two and one-half years (his first spent on the
campus) he did not indulge in one single date. So
the moral of the story is that if you sincerely desire
to uplife your character and build up your will power,
begin with crossing the street every time a woman
comes within your vision. However, let bygones be
bygones, for his first date proved to be such a luscious
encounter that he immediately followed it up with six
more dates, about all he could pack into that one
week. Benny told us so.
Cutting out the dirt though, Earl we must admit
is the type of a fellow whose presence is soon felt, be
it in a crowd or an argument. We attribute it to his
dynamic personality, will you doubt us? Earl is a
witty chap too. But a man is best judged by his deeds
so, in justice to him we will review a few of his ex-
ploits to present to you the man he really is.
His town of birth is Grand Haven, Michigan and
it is there he received his preparatory training. His
University career began in 1929 when he enrolled at
dear old Michigan as a Mechanical. After subscribing
to about every magazine and paper published on the
campus he came to the grim realization that most of
it was a sheer waste of money and so he turned his
steps to the better things. But he found himself quite
submerged in the great mass of struggling underclass-
men and little was heard of him until he became a
tryout with the Sigma Rho Tau and won the annual
Story Telling contest. He just missed winning the
Project Speaking contest by ten to the minus eight
power of the breadth of a horsehair. The latter netted
him $5, for which he promptly bought himself a share
in the Union, but the prize for the win in the story
telling proved a fizzle. The Stein he received was not
so bad looking and had its purpose but the darn thing
wi mld not make any funny noises.
Red stands for ruby, and for roses and for numer-
ous other things but just you ask Earl the next time
you run into him how he likes red paint over himself.
Poor froshies, their plights often do call for sympathy
on our part.
Sophomore year brought him no little glory. Earl
you will remember is one of the immortal "Conquer-
ing Heroes" who under the standards of Sigma Rho
Tau journeyed across the campus and stirred nation
wide comment when they defeated "Adelphi," literary
college debate team on the Muscle Shoals Project. De-
bate work seems to appeal to Earl in no small measure
as is best proven by the fact that he hasjieen with the
Sigma Rho Tau for four years during which time he
has held the offices of Secretary and President of the
organization.
His other activities have been quite fertile too. In
his junior year he was elected class treasurer and re-
ceived a bid from Triangles. He is further listed as
a Tau Beta Pi, member of the Intercollegiate Execu-
tive Council and as Vice President of A.S.M.E. local
student chapter.
He is by no means a man of a single objective;
quite the contrary—he always appears to have his fin-
gers in numerous pies at one time. His knack of
spreading sunshine wherever he goes has won him
many friends on the campus ranging from the bad
boys in the Acacia house to the modest Engineers, but
they are all friends—stalwart and true.
Sigma Rho Tau
The stump speakers, after months of rigorous and
unrelenting preparation, under the able tutelage of
Professor R. D. Brackett. are now in position to
plunge into the ardous debate activities awaiting them.
Michigan State College, Detroit Institute of Technol-
ogy and the City College of Detroit, housing other
chapters of Sigma Rho Tau, will form the opposition
in a series of debates scheduled for the early part of
the next semester. The debate question to be argu-
mented will be "Resolved that a system of sales and
income tax should be adopted by the state to materi-
ally reduce taxes on land value." Although respective
debate teams have not as yet been named a large squad

that will he difficult to conquer.
In an endeavor to disclose the potentialities of
speech organization, a new policy was instituted this
past semester whereby members of the faculty were
invited to regular meetings to give pep talks on sub-
jects relating to effective speech and its fundamentals.
This policy proved highly successful and the speakers
who appeared before a general assembly of members
are 'as follows: Professor Menefee who "spoke on
"Making the Most of One's Self"; Professor Brumm
who spoke on "Certainties and Certitudes"; Professor
Thornton who spoke on "Technocracies." Professor
Menefee in his speech indicated the place in individual
development held by the capability of self-expression
and personality; while Professor Brumm pointed out
the difference between personal convictions and abso-
lute facts and their place in good speaking.
Following these short talks, training circles com-
posed of aliout 5 freshmen each, (about eight groups
in all) gather in their assigned place of meeting and
with an older member as their tutor learn the rudi-
ments of effective speech presentation, often being
called on to make extemporaneous speeches in an ef-
fort to overcome timidity which might possess them
when facing an audience. Some promising talent has
already been developed in this way.
To give the freshmen a chance to display their
ability, Earl C. Briggs, who has all frosh teams under
his direction has arranged for a debate between a
frosh debate team and a team from Ypsi Normal.
The debate to take place sometime during the month
of January with the principal "bone of contention" to
be "Resolved that all policing should be done by the
state."
Work is also under way for an organization of
training circles solely for the advantage of upper
classmen so as to give an opportunity to every man
interested in debate work. Aside from debate work
Sigma Rho Tau itself offers prizes in the spring of
each year to its members most adept with an "oiled
tongue." Prizes are given in three divisions of the
field of speech, namely, Hall of Fame orations, pro-
ject speaking and story telling.
Matzek Winner of Goethe Essay Prize
A five-thousand word essay on the immortal Ger-
man poet Goethe written by Mahtias F. Matzek "33E
was recently awarded a $200 prize offered by the Carl
Schurz Memorial Foundation. The work was consid-
ered so excellent and mature as to cast doubt on its
authenticity and the fact that it had been written by an
undergraduate. However, a verification of Matzek's
Not the Moon-

down on a Snow

record by the school authorities erased all doubts in
the judges minds..
The essay contest included three assigned subjects
relating to the German poet, Goethe, the hundredth
anniversary of whose death is being celebrated this
year. Separate prizes were given in German and in
English. Matzek's essay was in German.
Matzek's interest in Goethe was first aroused by a
course which he took under Prof. W. A. Reichard he
explained, and so when he heard of the contest he de-
cided to submit an essay. It took Matzek about a
month to compile and write the essay.
This is not the first essay contest which Matzek
won. In 1930 he won the Thomas-Bronson German
prize of $50. with an essay on Theodore Storm and
his works.
Acoustical Society of America
The history of the science of sound was sketched by
Dr. Dayton C. Miller, of the Case School of Applied
Science, Cleveland, before the eighth meeting of the
Acoustical Society of America, recently held here.
Dr. Miller's talk was colored with anecdotes, slides, rare
books, flutes, tuning forks and a monochord.
Dr. Miller stated that only since the World War has
a thorough study of sound been carried on. Through
the Middle Ages and even into the seventeenth cen-
tury, scientists tried to link their mystic ideas about
music and sound with their conceptions of the uni-
verse. Even such a well-known scientist as Newton.
Dr. Miller pointed out, actually believed that there was

Dear Alumnus:
Here we are back again after an enjoyable vaca-
tion, and all set to start off another year with a
bang. Your editor sincerely hopes that your fes-
tivities were joyous. And now, how about those
New Year Resolutions? You didn't forget to in-
clude a note to the Technic, did you? What do you
say you get in touch with those students and former
pals of yours. Drop us a line, send us your address
and we'll most certainly pass it on. There's quite a
collection facing us now, so we'll just lean back and
reach into this most inviting stack. There's one in a
nice snappy envelope, and another decked out in
Christmas seals, and gosh! what inviting postmarks
some of these bear. But now to stop meandering
and start "dishing out the dirt":—
1892
The older Alums again take preference as ive
delve into our pile of New Year's letters. We hear
from Thomas Edson Barnum whose home is now
1071 Kast Circle Drive, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A
graduate of Electrical Engineering, Mr. Barnum at
present is consulting engineer for Cuttler-Hammer
Inc., 315 North Twelfth Street, Milwaukee.
1897
Our next letter comes from Lyman F. Morehouse,
telling of his employment by the American Tele-
phone and Telegraph Co. His position is that of
Equipment Development Engineer. Mr. More-
house's address is 30 Draper Avenue, Montclair,
New Jersey.
1899
A recent report informs us that the American Gas
and Electric Co.. 30 Church Street, New York, has
obtained the services of Emanuel Anderson as Ex-
ecutive Mechanical Engineer. Mr. Anderson's
home address is 125 Twentieth Street, Jackson
Heights. Long Island.
1901
Mr. John Castlereagh Parker, whom you M.E.'s
of 1901 probably remember, has now reached the
highly desirable and well earned position of presi-
dent of tlie Rrooklvn Edison Co.
1907
The Motor City now takes its place on our roll
call as we hear from Arthur A. Abel. His specific
job is that of Chief Design Engineer with the Con-
tinental Motors Corp., but he'll always find time to
write you if you'll only send vour address. He can
be reached at 2190 Newport Avenue, Detroit.
1908
And again Detroit scores; this time it is Dan H.
Meloche. Remember him? Well, now he is Direc-
tor of Metallurgical research for the American Radi-
ator Co., at the above named city. Before we move
on to the later classes, we must include Theodore
Clark Williams. Ted, it appears, is busy as super-
visor of the Western Union Telegraph Co., in New
York. His address is 848 Bogert Road, River Edge,
New Jersey.
1913
While still in the East, we drop in at 28 Miller
Avenue Tarrytown, New York, to be enlightened
considerably about Philip E. Baugh. His chief in-
terest is the Chevrolet Motor Car Co., where he is
occupied as Plant Manager in the Tarrytown Fac-
tory Branch. Raymond B. Prescott whose home is
48 Pavlin Blvd., Leonia, New Jersey, informs us
that he enjoys his occupation as Marketing and Fi-
nancial Counsellor. And still another easterner
claims our attention. We find that William W. Mc-
Williams is employed as Development Engineer for
the Western Electric Co., 149 Fulton Street, New
York.
P'rom there we travel to a heretofore little known
spot in Pennsylvania, St. Davids, by name. How-
ever, let's look again, for, from here comes James
W. Follin, who has just recently been highly hon-
ored by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation,
which announced his appointment to the Advisory
Committee of the Philadelphia Agency. Ever since
his graduation, he has been actively engaged in en-
gineering in and around Philadelphia. Since 1931.
he has been in charge of the Philadelphia Federa-
tion of the Construction Industry. Recently, he
has retired as the President of the Philly section
of the A.S.C.E., and still is a director and member

unemployed technical men. In addition, Michigan
Alumni clubs in the East occupy his interest. Among
his accomplishments are: President of U of M club
of Philadelphia in 1922-3, during which term he
developed the budget system of operating Alumni
clubs; organization of the Harrisburg club of
which he was chosen the first president of the 2nd
Alumni district. Last April he was re-elected to
this office. But that is by no means all, for he is
the proud father of a son and two daughters. Mr.

Our Alumni
Dr. Scrgius P.
Grace, '96E.
HAVING made a New Year's resolution to try
harder to please you by appreciably lengthen-
ing these articles and thereby do justice to the
men about whom we write, it is with pleasure that we
herewith present Dr. Sergius P. Grace.
Dr. Grace graduated from the Electrical Engineering
Department of the University of Michigan in 1896.
It was only a short time after this that he went with the
Detroit Telephone Company, then an independent tele-
phone company, serving Detroit and the lower part of
Michigan. This was about the time in telephone his-
tory when telephone lines were being put under ground.
The electrolysis of the cables due to the moisture in
the ground presented a serious problem to the engi-
neers working on the installation. Dr. Grace's Rem-
edy for this deterioration of the cables won him a
position as Electrical Engineer with this company in
the middle of the year 1897. His work in this capacitv
lead him to design a large amount of telephone appa-
ratus for use in rural telephone installations. His work
on underground cables gave him the requirements
necessary to the engineer who was to solve the problem
of "planting" cables in the city of New Orleans, where
one may dig down about two feet and strike water.
Dr. Grace also built important telephone plants in At-
lantic City, Trenton and many other cities of New
Jersey.
In 1900, a large number of the independent telephone
companies were consolidated and went under the name
of the Bell Telephone Company. Dr. Grace was given
the position of Equipment Engineer in charge of switch-
board design for a group of companies, including the
Michigan Bell Telephone Company, Northwestern Bell
Telephone Company and the Southwestern Bell Tele-
phone Company. 1902 saw him with the American
Telephone and Telegraph company whose headquarters
were then in Boston. He then went to Pittsburgh to
become the Chief Engineer of the Central District Tele-
phone Company which has since merged with the Bell
Telephone Company of Pennsylvania. It was through
his work in connection with this concern that he re-
placed the open wire system with the system known as
Aerial Cable Distribution, a system of his own design.
He evolved also as a part of this installation a system of
multiple tapping and overlapping of the cable pairs in
the adjacent terminals, thus giving greater flexibility
in connecting the subscriber's wires to the service lines.
These terminals are still used and are known as the
"Grace" terminal. The Aerial Cable System and the
"Grace" terminal are both used exclusively the world
over.
Another remarkable contribution was his mathemati-
cal treatment of the stresses and deformations in steel
strand used for supporting aerial cables. This led to a
new design of cable construction known as the "Grace
Slack Strand System." This system was quickly ac-
cepted and may be seen any place where cables have
been erected. He wrote a number of articles on this
subject for various publications one of which appeared
as a feature article in the Michigan Technic a number
of years back.
From 1903 to 1913, Dr. Grace was respectively, Chief
Engineer and General Superintendent of the Plant of
the Central District Bell Telephone Company of Pitts-
burgh and Western Pennsylvania and had complete
charge of the design, construction and operation of the
company's properties. The University of Michigan
took note of his admirable work and in 1904 conferred
upon him the degree of E.E. In 1913 he was elected to
the presidency of the Engineer's Society of Western
Pennsylvania.
He then went to New York where he was engaged
by the Public Service Commission of the State of New
York as the Chief Telephone Engineer to make an ap-
praisal of the properties of the New York Telephone
Company and to assist in the adjustment of Telephone
rates. Following this work he became Assistant Chief
Engineer of the New York Telephone Company. In
the next five years he was called upon by ten states to
give technical and other testimony before Public Ser-
vice Commissions in order that they might adjust
telephone rates.
In 1920, Dr. Grace obtained a year's leave of absence
from the telephone system to devote his time to some-
thing entirely different. During this year he was as-
sistant to the president of the Standard Radium and
Vanadium Companies of Pittsburgh who were produc-

FIRST AID
for unbroken joints
How to keep silt and sand from clogging tele-
phone cable ducts was one problem put up to
engineers at Bell Telephone Laboratories. No
known method of joining sections of vitrified clay
conduit effected a seepage-tight joint.
With scientific thoroughness, telephone men
made many tests under service conditions. They
devised a bandage of cheese-cloth, waterproof
paper and mortar. Easily made and applied, this
mortar bandage is tight against silt and sand. It
prevents clogging, greatly simplifies the installa-
tion of new telephone cables and the removal of
old ones.
Through solving such interesting problems,
Bell System men work steadily nearer to their goal
—telephone service of highest possible efficiency.

NEWS THAT'S RUBBISH
It has been voted upon by the students that the
day preceding any vacation and the day following
should be abolished and it has received the whole-
hearted cooperation of the faculty.
Students find that they have too much free time.
Longer class periods and longer lessons have been
requested. After one attends classes from 8:00
A.M. to 5:30 P.M. there is nothing else to do but
walk the street and look for trouble. A great many
students would relish classes at night which would
give them ample time to prepare lessons between
midnight and daylight.
Shortly after television had been installed on the
campus at the University of Michigan, the Dean of
Women threw a monkey wrench (monkey business)
into the machinery. It was found that many dates
were made with Campus Co-eds on Saturday night
(bathnight). No provision could be made for chap-
erons.
The Detroit Observatory reports that a full week
passed by with only 160 inches of rainfall. Cali-
fornia Chamber of Commerce please note.
Campus Traditions are upheld by freshmen. Near-
by Speakeasies report no decline in their business.
A 30/r reduction is offered to those wearing pots
which accounts for the fact that more pots are seen
on the campus than ever before. Is that so?
Prosperity is just around the corner. "Stresses
and Strains" predicts that by March, Engineering
Corporations will clamor for engineering graduates.

Prices of textbooks strike a new low. Reports
have it that some of the textbooks will soon be as
low as eight dollars. Eight page Bluebooks will

Has anyone (?) noticed what a lousey looking,
foul smelling place East Hall is. Let's have some
contributions, letters to the administration, pep
meetings,—action—action. Surely you red-blooded
students, the flower of your glorious race, budding
Americans, blooming idiots, and future arbitrators
of your glorious profession, are you going to sit
by and let a bunch of tightwads make you grow-
up in surroundings calculated to stunt, stifle, and
ruin your aesthetic development? Where are these
Honor Societies, councils, and sleepwalkers? What
solution can WE offer? Here are some suggestions.
Social ostracism of the B and G boys. Remove A
brick every time you leave the building. Use the
building for E.M. testing material. Use it for frat-
ernity initiations or change it to a gas station and

A second group of experiments illustrates by models
the various phenomena and laws of free and forced
vibrations. This group is comprised of five experi-
ments on special phases of this subject. Such interest-
ing phenomena as resonance, critical speeds of shafts,
energy absorption, beating effect, and vibration ab-
sorbers are treated. It would be difficult to find a
single problem of more practical importance in en-
gineering than that of vibrations.
Another group of experiments deal with curvilinear
motion and problems in rotation. Of particular inter-
est among these is a study of the balancing of crank
shafts and rotating parts in various types of machinery.
The laboratory has two commercial types of balancing
machines with which the student is made familiar.
Here, as in other experiments, however, the aim is to
show the basic principles upon which balancing is
based, rather than to gain proficiency in the operation
of the machine.
Another group shows several methods of experi-
mentally determining the centroids, moments of in-
ertia, and principal axes of irregularly shaped bodies.
This work is valuable inasmuch as it is often the only
practical way of obtaining these quantities. One ex-
periment deals with the gyroscope and its various ap-
plications.
The experimental work is so planned as to parallel
the theoretical class work. The student therefore ob-
tains a good physical picture of the various problems
which he considers in class.
Besides this undergraduate course in experimental
dynamics opportunity is given for advanced research
work in dynamics, for those who are interested in study-
ing problems in this field. Special equipment, such as
balancing machines, the "stroboglow" for observing
high frequency vibrations, and vibrographs and torsi -
ographs for measuring such vibrations, is also to be
found in the laboratory.
A subject attracting particular interest at this time
is that of so-called "self-induced" vibrations. There
are a number of practical examples of this type of
vibration in nature and some of them have a very
special bearing on engineering problems. One im-
portant example of this is the large amplitudes of
lateral vibration of telegraph wires, which are built up
by a particular combination of wind and ice forma-
tion. There is in the laboratory some equipment for
demonstrating and studying this very interesting phe-
nomenon.
New equipment is constantly being added in an en-
deavor to keep the laboratory abreast of the times. It
is hoped that a greater number of students will appre-
ciate the advantages of a better knowledge of dynamics,
learned through the method of experiment, and will
avail themselves of the opportunities of this laboratory.
1933 AUTOMOBILE REVIEW
(Continued from page 9)
DeSoto
DeSoto automotive engineers have created for the
motor buying public this year not only one of Ameri-
ca's outstanding low priced sixes, but they have em-
bodied many interesting mechanical features into this
smartly designed car- With a low price range beginning
at $695.00, this new car will no doubt make a strong
showing in the medium-low priced group for 1933.
One of the main lxxly improvements to be found in
this new line is the deluxe appearance of the interiors.
The upholstery is very pleasing and well contoured to
afford greater seating comfort. All interior trim is
of the panel type and finished in two distinctive tones.
A fine work in highly decorative design is exampli-
fied on the new DeSoto's instrument panel. Its center-
piece is an extra large speedometer.
Mechanically the cars have many new features. Note-
worthy features are the new automatic choke, manifold
heat control, a better transmission equipped with quiet
helical gears, high speed exhaust valve seats that pro-
long the time before valve grinding becomes necessary.
The power plant has a one eighth inch more stroke
than last year's engine, and its new dimensions are
3J/J by 4y&amp;. It develops 79 h.p. at 3600 r.p.m. with
a 5-35 to 1 compression ratio and 86 h.p. with a 6.2 to
1 Red Head type engine.

ADVERSE POSSESSION
(Continued from page 7)
a lost grant, for it is probable that if the intruder has
really received a grant to the land he will remain in
possession either by himself or through an agent or
tenant. The natural question arises as to the interpre-
tation of the word continuous. If a bachelor leaves his
farm to purchase supplies it would not seem that his
possession has been interrupted. This would in no
way weaken his position that he is claiming the property
as his own. In fact, the court went much further than
this in Cook vs Clinton, 64 Mich. 309; 31 N. W. 317.
The intruder in this instance fenced in the tract of land,
cultivated and harvested it in season, but never entered
the property in the winter time. The court held this
to be adverse possession.
The case of Lasley vs Kniskern, 165 Mich. 244; 115
N. W. 971, involved wild lands in Muskegon County.
The intruder hired a neighbor to keep trespassers off
of the land, though his actual use of the land did not
amount to more than occasionally cutting poles and
firewood thereon. Yet the Court held that the posses-
sion was sufficiently adverse and continuous to meet the
legal requirements. The intruder was entering under
void tax deeds.
The requirement of continuity raises the question of
"tacking" of periods. For instance, Arthur Wells is
holding a farm adversely for eight years when he dies,
and his son Phillip enters as an heir. Phillip remains
in possession for the remaining seven years of the statu-
tory period and then claims title by adverse possession.
The law designates that there is a privity of interest
and the son's time may be tacked on to his father's
time. This is entirely consistent with the theory of a
lost grant. The same result would have been attained
if during his life time Arthur Wells had sold by quit
claim deed to Springer, and Springer now desired to
tack his time to his grantor's. Wells. Of course, this
is based upon privity of relationship, and the rule of
tacking is limited to this condition. For instance, if
Wells abandoned after five years and Smith immedi-
ately entered adversely, his time could not be added to
Wells. The court construes that Smith is holding ad-
versely to Wells as well as to the true owner and must
rely entirely on his own period of possession.
Another requirement is that the possession must be
actual, visible, and notorious. This is the ordinary
characteristic of true ownership. Furthermore, it is
necessary that the owner have an opportunity of knowl-
edge so that his cause of action may start. We would
certainly not want the law to give title to a neighboring
mining company which has secretly extended its drifts
over to the true owner's land. Such an owner could
hardly be guilty of laches when he did not know that
his rights were being intruded upon. The issue of
notorious possession is peculiar to itself, and each cir-
cumstance must be decided on its own merits. In the
Oakland County case of Bird vs Stark, 66 Mich. 654:
Page Twenty-two

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


whether the possession was so notorious that the true
owner had knowledge, but rather whether a reasonably
diligent man under the circumstances would have been
aware that an intruder was claiming adversely to him.
The matter of incorrect boundary fences offers some
difficulties in legal analysis. If Smith's line fence is
accidentally erected on his neighbor's land, it would
seem that Smith is on the extra land without any inten-
tion of claiming title thereto. In other words, the
possession is not adverse, and should not give rise to
title by adverse possession. On the other hand, if
Smith deliberately pushed his fence over on to his
neighbor's property in order to seek more land, he is
truly holding adversely and should benefit accordingly.
In the Allegan County case of Berry vs Steuer, 246
Mich. 300; 224 N. W. 391, the surveyor made a dis-
tinct error in fencing a ten acre tract. The court went
into a rather lengthy interpretation of the surveyor's
error, and then closed the case by saying the discrep-
ancies were taken care of by adverse possession. It
must be appreciated that the rules are not uniform
throughout the states, however. But there is a dis-
tinct advantage in holding to the doctrine that a fence
of long standing truly represents the boundary line. It
conforms to the probable intentions of remote grantees
on either side of the fence.
Since 1907 the law in Michigan has been well es-
tablished that the claiming of title by adverse lxissession
shall not run against the state or its political subdivisions
in the matter of such property as is used in govern-
mental functions. This has particular reference to
intrusions on the public highway. While the cases do
not indicate that Michigan highways were intruded
upon like many other states, yet a definite statute on the
matter has been enacted. Its doctrine is quite consis-
tent with the common law interpretation of the sov-
ereign power of the state.
State Highway Engineers Annual Conference
Plans for the 19th annual conference on highway
engineering for the state of Michigan, which will be
held February 14. 15, 16, at the Union, are nearing
completion, according to Prof. R. L. Morrison, of the
highway engineering department, who will preside at
the meeting. Tentative plans include a smoker to be
held on the evening of the 14th. The annual dinner
will probably be held on the 16th. The mornings and
afternoons of the session will be devoted to illustrated
discussions and lectures on various technical and safety
phases of highway engineering. This meeting is spon-
sored jointly by the College of Engineering, the Michi-
gan State Highway Department, and the Michigan
Association of Road Commissioners and Engineers.
Professor Morrison further stated that the session
would also include business meetings of the Michigan
Good Roads Association and the Michigan Traffic and
Safety Directors' Association.

In the long grind, it's the athlete with the stamina
who lasts.
So, too, with a Jenkins Valve. It's the body stamina
that counts, that keeps the valve in the line, un-
affected by the strains of pipe weight and settling,
lifting, expansion, con traction or frequentoperation.
Jenkins bronze valves are cast of virgin metal;
Jenkins iron body valves of a high quality, close-
grained mixture. Metals are analyses-controlled by
Jenkins metallurgists. Skillful design is provided
to make possible an even distribution of metal
throughout the valve body.
Jenkins Valves are made in bronze and iron, in
standard, medium and extra heavy pattern—a
valve for practically every valve need.

tion of this type of locomotive is that of the 70-ton unit
shown in the figure to transportation work in a large
steel manufacturing plant. The locomotive is used for
charging, hot metal and slag handling, and general
switching and distribution work. Its operation has
proved to be much faster than that of the steam loco-
motive.
The Diesel-electric power plant combines the ad-
vantages of the Diesel engine with those of the direct-
current generator and motor. The Diesel engine is
a very efficient heat engme (as heat engines go) and
it uses a cheap fuel. The direct-current generator and
motor, on the other hand, furnish an efficient system
of speed control. It is not surprising then that the
combination should be successfully applicable to trans-
portation work.
Uses for Stainless Steels
One of the largest groups of alloy steels is that group
of chromium and chromium-nickel steels generally
called stainless steels. These steels have found a wide
application in practically every branch of industry,
because they combine with the desirable physical prop-
erties of ordinary steel and cast iron the ability to
resist atmospheric corrosion, attack from oxidizing
agents, and scaling at elevated temperatures.
In the food preparation and distribution fields, stain-
less steels are becoming increasingly popular because
of their resistance to rust and corrosion by food prod-
ucts and because they do not affect the taste or odor of
the food. They are therefore used for a great many of
the processes which require handling or contacting
food by the use of metals.
These steels have found a wide application in chem-
ical industries. They offer great resistance to nitric
acid and other powerful oxidizing agents, and they can
also be used in processes requiring resistance to high
temperature oxidation and maintenance of strength at
these high temperatures. For these reasons they have
been particularly applicable in refining and cracking
processes in the petroleum industry.
Transportation offers another wide field for the use
of stainless steels. They are used in aircraft and auto-
mobile engine parts because of their high temperature
properties. Their adaptation to railway service fur-
nishes the possibility of great savings in weight by their
use in all-metal passenger cars, while their chemically
resistive properties make them particularly applicable
to marine work.
Finally, they are being much used in architecture as
well as in automobile body construction to give in-
creased utility and lasting beauty.
The outlook for increasing use of stainless steels is
highly promising in view of its recent large expansion
in use and its adaptability to so many different condi-
tions.

ing large quantities of Radium, Vanadium and Urani-
um from carnotite ores of Colorado.
Alx&gt;ut this time, serious difficulties were arising with
the National Electric Light Association because of in-
ductive interference caused by electric light and power
lines. The difficulties were assuming the proportions
of an expensive law suit but the work of Dr. Grace and
other averted the necessity of such proceedings and
resulted in a better understanding between the two
industries.
In 1922, Dr. Grace took charge of the laboratories of
the company which were then trying to investigate all
possible by-product services which the company might
render. These laboratories turned out such remarkable
pieces of equipment as that necessary for picture trans-
mission over wire, radio broadcasting, telephone type-
writer service, special alarm service and others.
Two years later he was put in charge of the Bell
Telephone Laboratories. His experience along re-
search engineering lines and his general broad knowl-
edge of operating management lead to the development
and commercialization of the Orthophonic Victrola.
Orthophonic records, the electrical stethescope, the arti-
ficial larynx, audiometers, permalloy cables, and last
but not least, the sound pictures.
The next phase of Dr. Grace's career, has brought
him into international prominence. He was elected
to the Presidency of the New York Electrical society.
He realized that the public in general did not under-
stand the engineer and his work. That they thought
the scientist and the engineer was someone a bit queer
was very evident. His connection with the Electrical
Society gave him an opportunity to gain direct contact
with the public. He grasped this opportunity to show
to the public that the scientist and his works were really
something human. He did this by conducting a forum
and delivering a very large number of lectures through-
out the United States in which he explained the newest
developments in science in terms that the general pub-
lic could readily understand and appreciate. He was
greeted with large audiences wherever he went and
fmally came to be in such great demand as a lecturer
that it became impossible for him to accept all of the
requests for lectures. In three years he delivered his
characteristically interesting lectures and demonstrations
before a total audience of 300,000 people.
Recently, he was given honorary degrees from the
University of Michigan and Notre Dame University.
The former bestowed upon him the degree of Doctor
of Engineering and the latter the degree of Doctor of

Representatives of '28 also come from the
General Electric staff. They are A. W. Kramer,
with the Fractional Horsepower Motor Engineering
Department in Fort Wayne. Indiana, and Henry
C. Thompson with the Contract Service Depart-
ment in New York. Before we close for this month,
however, we must visit the sunny west coast, and so
we say "Hello" to Arthur Ray Haskins who is a
draftsman. Mr. Haskins is at home at 727 North
Catalina, Pasadena, California.
The Eastern Seaboard contributes another letter
to our collection. Charles A. Heiss of 191 North
Arlington Avenue.. East Orange, New Jersey, is the
contributor. He gladly sends us note of his em-
ployment with the American Telephone and Tele-
graph of New York. His specific job is conptroller.

Here we have a very interesting note concerning
Mr. B. W. Cain. At present. Mr. Cain is taking the
third year of the Advanced Course in Engineering,
conducted by the General Electric Co.. in Schenec-

held in the East Physics Building brought the meet-
ing to a close.
A.I.E.E. Preliminary Contact Program
The first preliminary contact program of the year for
electrical engineers was held Monday, Dec. 12, 1932, in
the Natural Science Auditorium. Professor Moore
asked that all electrical students fill out student person-
nel cards in the near future. He then introduced Mr.
A. M. Dudley, of the Westinghouse Elec. &amp; Mfg. Co.,
who spoke on "Aspects of the Job Situation." Mr.
Dudley's conception of success in engineering is finding
your right place and job in the world and then sticking
to it. He described as the three fundamental qualifi-
cations for success in engineering first, technical ability,
second, personality, and third, executive ability, which
latter qualification may be defined as the ability to get
work done. Mr. Dudley gave some interesting ex-
amples in his own experience of men who had reached
a high position in industry but had still failed to suc-
ceed, through some inherent fault, such as lack of de-
cision, laziness, or flippancy. During the day, Mr. Dud-
ley held interviews with many of the senior electrical
engineers. He said that there were no openings in the
field at present due to the depression and the fact that
many former employees will be taken on first. He was
confident that we had seen the worst of the depression
and that from now on, conditions would improve.
Collection of Lectures Published
Most recent among the publications of faculty mem-
bers is a novel lxnmd volume consisting of a collection
of lectures on "The Engineer in Modern Production"
by Professor Alexander P. Gwiazdowski of the shop
practice department of the College of Engineering.
This volume deals with design, fabrication, and use of
milling cutters, twist drills and broaches in modern
industrial practice.
The volume, which has just appeared on the market,
is but the first of a series now in manuscript.
Applied Mechanics Colloquium
Two important matters were discussed on the pro-
gram of the December 15, 1932, meeting:
Mr. D. K. Kazarinotf presented a paper on "The
Spherical Pendulum" with small oscillations, indi-
cating that the usual treatment is too complicated, in-
volving elliptic functions, or if the elementary treatment
is employed a rough approximation only is obtained
which does not explain the most striking characteristic
of the oscillation, namely the rotation. It was sug-
gested to derive in an approximate way the formula
which fully explains this motion. The graphical pic-
ture of the motion which was produced on a photo-
graphic plate was examined and the observed values
were seen to be in very good agreement with the values
obtained from this approximate formula which Mr.
Kazarinoff derived. The path described by the pendu-
lum is that produced by a point moving on an ellipse
which is slowly revolving about its center. The meth-
od used in obtaining the formula is due to Tisserand and
Kriloff.
Professor H. R. Lloyd reviewed the recent book on
"Applied Gyrodynamics" by E. S. Ferry, Professor of
Physics, Purdue University. In the preface the au-
thor of the book stated that the purpose of the book was
to bring gyrodynamics from behind the wall of dif-
ferential equations and integral signs that have hedged
it in. The book was commended for the simple way in
which the fundamental principles are explained. Its
chief merit, however, resides in the complete informa-
tion which it contains on all the important applications
of gyroscopic devices. A word of warning was sounded
concerning some mathematical errors. Angular mo-
mentum is there defined as the product of moment of
inertia and angular velocity which is not generally true
for three dimensional motion. The dynamic equations
with moving axes were obtained in an incorrect form.
In discussing the Schlick stabilizer the author states
that the period of the ship's roll is reduced whereas
the pendulous gyro actually increases the period of
roll, the secondary fast vibration or tremor being of no
importance. Professor Lloyd expressed the hope that
these aml other mistakes will be corrected in future

Transportation Club
In 1925 a group of students and some members of
the faculty in the Engineering College felt the need
of an organization that would afford a basis of fellow-
ship for the two parties—thus forming a closer union.
It had to be an organization of technical nature and
still cover the various phases of the engineering field.
The appeal of the organization had to be as inviting to
the Civil Engineer as it would be to a Mechanical or
a Marine. To meet this need it was decided to form
a transportation club since it is the second largest In-
dustry in the world. There is no field of Engineering
that transportation does not enter into some phase of
its operation.
The Transportation Club by means of illustrated lec-
tures and talks by experienced men in different fields
of the engineering profession, the local as well as dis-

tant inspection trips, tends to acquaint the student
with the more practical side of engineering. To provide
contact with current problems of transportation is its
further purpose.
The wide variety of important discussions it had
covered in the past years speaks highly for its en-
deavors in promoting the purpose of the organization.
Discussions embraced talks on railway systems, in-
land water-way operations, public utilities and air facil-
ities. The organization has also brought before the
engineering body of the University such men as the
Honorable John F. Stevens of the Panama Canal and
Mr. Fitzgerald. President of the Western Maryland
Railroad.
The membership in the Club is open to all members
of the Engineering College and entitles the member to
all activities of the club. The Transportation Club of
the University of Michigan is a member of the Associ-
ated Traffic Clubs of America, an organization made up
of Traffic Clubs of some sixty cities in the United
States. Local membership carries visiting privileges
in any of the other clubs in the country, with full privi-
leges of club rooms lectures, and entertainments. This
privilege is a particularly valuable one to the students
coming from large cities who are interested in extending
their professional acquaintances.
This year in the near future the club will journey to
Cleveland and Jackson where the members will go
through the New York Central Terminal in Cleveland.
Ohio (the most modern terminal in the United States),
and in Jackson, Michigan they will visit the locomotive
works and other facilities of the Michigan Central
Railroads.
Phi Kappa Phi Selects Seven Engineers
Seven seniors in the College of Engineering and one
member of the faculty were taken in the Annual
Fall initiation of Phi Kappa Phi, the All-campus hon-
orary society, recently. Those chosen because of their
remarkable scholarship and record of service to their
University included: Irvin K. Boynton "33E, Presi-
dent of Tau Beta Pi, Richard N. Cogger '33E, Man-
aging Editor of the Michigan Technic, Matthias Mat-
zek '33E, winner of the recent Goethe German Essay
prize. Harold P. Hesler '33E, Owen K. Brown '33E,
Irvin J. Sattinger '33E, and Victor Matulaitus '33E.
Professor Louis Hopkins, Secretary of the College of
Engineering, was the faculty man so highly honored.
The banquet was held in the Michigan Union and
was addressed by Professor William H. Hobbs, Presi-
dent of the local chapter, who conducted the ceremony
of initiation and presented the awards.

the New Economics
By Harlow S. Person, '99E.
Managing Director of Taylor Institute, New York City

WK KREyUKNTI.Y hear it charged that the
engineers are responsible for over-mechani-
zation, obsolescence, unemployment and other
phases of our industrial problem. There is only a modi-
cum of truth in such a statement. Engineering is sci-
entific and impersonal. It adds to the store of human
knowledge and to its available instruments of produc-
tion, but it does not compel industry to use them
unwisely. The responsibility for unwise use rests
squarely upon the promoters, owners and managers in
industry. However, the engineer as consultant and as
manager must share this responsibility to some degree,
for as designer, estimator and frequently as actual
manager he is in a position to advise owners and mana-
gers concerning the wisdom and economy of use in
particular instances. He is too much inclined to focus
his attention on short-time engineering-economic as-
pects of a project such as reduction of unit cost by
the substitution of a machine for human labor, without
."dequate regard for the social-economic factors of
Competition, prices, purchasing power, variable demand,
obsolescence, trends in industry and in general the total
economy of use.
A few engineers have risen above these limitations
and are winning status as economists as well as engi-
neers. Recently the author heard a social scientist
dtclare in a public address that the engineers are now
our best economists. This acclaim is as far from the
real fact as is the accusation noted a1x&gt;ve. The ratio
of engineers who are making themselves also progres-
sive-thinking economists to the total number of engi-
neers is less than the ratio to the total number of
economists of those who have broken through the
intellectual limitations imposed by classical traditions.
The fact is that a new group of students and leaders
is coming into being; a group composed on the one
hand of engineers who are acquiring the social-economic
point of view and are exploring the body of knowledge
and technique given by economics, and on the other
hand, of economists who are becoming aware of the
significance of the engineering technique and are ex-
ploring the body of knowledge built up by engineering.
Both elements of this new group have realized that
while one may specialize his activity at any particular
Harlow S. Person
moment, he can no longer specialize the governing
point of view or body of information with which all
tasks are approached.
Engineering is creating a new world, a world of
surplus economy which is not manageable through the
principles and technique of an older, deficit economy.
Our present industrial problem is an expression of this
incompatibility. It is not merely a phenomenon of
cyclic depression but apparently also one of severe
break in the secular trend. That is why the depression
has lasted so long and will probably continue to last
for a considerable number of years.
Several new forces in our national development have
come to focus during the past decade and the resultant
combined force has caused what we call a break in the
secular trend.
The first of these new forces relates to population.
The closure of our doors to immigration has made
significant the fact that we have for some time been
experiencing a declining rate of increase of population,
p.nd are confronted by the prospect of a stationary or
declining population which may be realized during the
lives of the younger readers of this article. At the
same time the production of social income is increasing
at a rapid rate. This requires enormous readjustments
in order to maintain the circular flow of production-
consumption forces; equalization in the domestic dis-
tribution of social income, or rapid development of
foreign markets, or radical restriction in agricultural
and industrial production, or some composite of these.
The second of these new forces relates to interna-
tional finance and commerce. We have been a debtor
nation; recently fate has been apparently unkind
enough to make us a creditor nation. If we elect to
remain a creditor nation what has been called a favora-
ble balance of trade will have become unfavorable, and
what has been called an unfavorable balance of trade
will have become favorable. To make necessary read-
justments will be a shock to our business structure as
now organized. If we elect (and are able) not to be
a creditor nation and therefore put obstacles in the way

By H. J. McFarlan, Assistant Professor of Geodesy and Surveying
TO CONTRIBUTE a worthwhile discussion about
Technocracy is an exceedingly difficult task. One
more personal opinion would seem not to be
uorth much in the midst of such a flood of opinions as
\\e have on this subject at present. In the expression
of one's views, any attempt at interpreting meanings is
likely to be merely a reflection of one's background and
an airing of one's prejudices. With
adequate, authentic information
about the theory of Technocracy
unavailable, the best that can be
done is to attempt to evaluate such
statements as seem to have some
degree of reliability. Because of a
lack of space it seems wise to refer
principally to Harpers Magazine
for January, 1933, inasmuch as the
artcile it contains is said to have
been prepared under the supervis-
ion of Howard Scott, Director of
the Energy Survey of North
America.
The comments that have been
made public have ranged from
whole-hearted and complete en-
dorsement of the views of the Technocrats to a skepti-
cal distrust of any part of their position and there has
been a number of attempts to discredit the integrity of
Mr. Scott, who is the leading meml&gt;er of the group.
There is a prevalent feeling that they have a pessimistic
outlook for the future, and there is almost universal
opinion that they have not made a thoroughly clear
presentation of their case. They are accused of exag-
geration, of the presentation of one-sided facts, of the
failure to recognize any reasonableness in any other
point of view, and of extreme vagueness. In view of the
startling nature of their facts and conclusions, these
varied reactions are not to be wondered at.
"A crisis in the history of American civilization is at
hand. The nation stands at the threshold of what is
simultaneously opportunity and disaster. The oppor-
tunity is one for social benefit, the disaster is the failure
of the price system: and neither opportunity nor dis-
aster may be escaped." This quotation summarizes the
opinions of the Technocrats. The facts and analysis
presented are in support of these contentions. Those
who can vision no successful economic organization
cther than the "price system," foresee only disaster if
With the wide spread of Tech-
nocracy it has seemed advisable to
treat this subject in these columns.
This is the first in a series of two
articles on the subject and is writ-
ten by an engineer. The second
will be written by an economist
and will appear in the next issue
of the Technic. It is hoped that
these discussions will prove both
interesting and profitable to our
readers.
The Editor
the predictions of the Technocrats are true. Students
of radical, social, and economic works see no disaster in
the failure of the price system, in fact, they see its fall
as a necessity and they foresee the realization of their
hopes for a more just distribution of the world's goods
and pleasures. The threat of disaster and likewise of
opportunity is claimed. Whether the resultant opinion
is cheery or dark depends upon the
background of the individual who
holds it. It does not seem that the
Technocrats are necessarily guilty
of having presented a pessimistic
outlook.
If they were absolutely clear
and logical, they would likely
receive much criticism because
they have made such sweep-
ing statements. "How clearly can
it now be seen that our bankers are
merchants of debt and economics
is the pathology of debt . . . We
need look for no help from Repub-
licans, Democrats, Socialists, Fasc-
ists, or Communists." In effect,
they say that every one is out of
step but themselves. How much of the public
reaction is against this attitude and how much is
justified by a careful review of their most complete
statement? After all, it is conceivable that 120,000.000
Americans could be wrong in their understanding of
cur present situation.
The Technocrats give figures to show how much more
power is available for the production of goods than was
the case when man and his beasts of burden were the
principal source. More figures tell how the harnessing
of this power to machines is reducing the amount of
human labor necessary in production. Still other
figures are given to show what could be done if the
price system did not cause the withholding from use,
of knowledge already available. Their estimate of an
income equivalent to 20,000 dollars a year for every
one, under a system of production organized to make
use of available technological knowledge in a coordi-
nated manner, is startling. They argue that we only
need to recognize that power /is the dominant factor
in our American civilization, that if we measure goods
in terms of energy units we will have a precise measure,
which will enable us to eliminate the confusion caused
Page Six

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


They further state that we must do this, because our
structure of civilization is growing in such a way, that
if we continue our antiquated theories of measurement,
it will fail.
—That energy use is of major importance in the modern
era cannot be denied. Surely men do less work in pro-
ducing more goods than has ever been true in the past.
There is no reason for doubting that many practices are
engaged in which cause the withholding of improved
processes for the sake of profit. We know that many
things are done against the social welfare and that
business is organized on a basis which stimulates anti-
social practices. Food is destroyed to keep up the
market. Advertising is untrue. In many ways we
.still grant the right of an individual to try to profit
at the expense and even the suffering of the group.
The economic moral is the one stated by David Harum:
"Do unto others as they would like to do unto you—
but be sure to do it first." When one realizes the
enormous wastes that occur as a result of applying
individual horsepower psychology to a social, electric-
power world it does not take much imagination to
guess that we might all be much better off.
It is unfortunate that there is probably justice in
believing that exaggerations have been made. Common
sense tells us that many of the statements made are
in the direction of being right. It is difficult to tell
bow far accusations of unreliability are true. Why
engineers would be led to over-state their case, espe-
cially when it would appear to l&gt;e a strong one without,
is hard to understand. Yet many things are said which
common sense again makes it hard to believe. It would
seem wise for us as engineers to reserve judgments
until we are in a position to know the reliability of
information necessary in reaching a conclusion. It
would seem a duty to be actively and constantly in
search of such information. We must realize that any
far reaching and fundamental attack upon the inade-
quacy of existing institutions will tend to evoke de-
fense reactions which are not truthful and wholesome.
Because slighting statements have been made about them
is no reason why Republicans, Democrats, Socialists,
or Communists should close their minds to a consider-
ation of the general thesis. The Technocrats seem not
to have been very accurate nor very clear in coordi-
nating their technical, economic, and social views. That,
however, is no reason for discarding their points of
\iew which may have worth. Even though it may not
bc necessary, as they (and many others) believe, it cer-
tainly would seem desirable to make honest and serious
endeavor to learn how to improve the world in which
we live. This is their challenge. We must and we
can make great changes, but information and thinking
rire necessary.
While they belittle economics and say that the dc-

The hen that laid the golden ERG
velopment of technology is responsible for our ills, yet
they make an economic analysis essentially like that
propounded as early as 1868. by Karl Marx, and from
that analysis draw the opposite conclusion that it is
not technology nor the machine, but the manner in
which these are used, which is. responsible for our
sorry state of affairs. "Our debts have been increas-
ing at a rate faster than production and both of them
faster than the rate of population . . . Modern indus-
try is operated under the price system and to I&gt;e suc-
cessful it must do one thing; it must make a profit
:"id pay a return on the money invested. . . . The small
investing fraction of our population cannot possihlv
spend all their interest and dividends, and the result
is that this return must be reinvested in production. . . .
This means that production must pay further interest
and dividends. ... It isn't what people produce that
proves their wealth, it is what they consume. ... It
is plain that we must get for ourselves a new series
of standards if we are to deal with this highly intricate
social mechanism that technology has built. ... It
matters not a rap what men think, wish, or desire, . . .
"We are face to face with the law of nature. ... A new
system based upon a recognition and on an understand-
ing of our available energy must be devised. . . . That
is the problem before the people. It can I&gt;e done. Aiv
we going to set about it before it is too late?" It is
hoped that these scattered quotations give a just and
fair summary of their economic analysis. It would
seem more realistic to state that technology has speeded
the development of the price (profit) system to the
breaking point. Many believe that the socialization
of functional processes would have eventually made
this inevitable, without the technical advances. In fact,
technology is just an advanced stage and a natural
result of the development of the socialization process.
To one familiar with the economic literature of
Vcblen, Steinmetz, Marx, Lenin, and Trotzky, there is
nothing new in this economic analysis, except possibly
that it is carelessly done. There is little question that
the position taken has been inspired by the works of
Socialist writers, and is essentially the one held by

Arbitration
By Professor Walter C. Sadler
Arch of Law Club
ABITRATION is the settling of controversies
through the agency of an independent bureau
called a board of arbitrators. The parties in
interest appoint a board of arbitrators who meet and
hear the relative merits of the issues and then award
a decision which should conclude the controversy. This
method of procedure is so old in the English law that
its origin is indistinct in the distant past. Even the
early court records speak of the great antiquity of the
subject. This long record of existence would indicate
that the courts have looked with favor upon the prac-
tice. In fact, the judicial decisions themselves have
commended the practice to society, based upon the
desirability of avoiding costly and slow litigation.
But the use of arbitration has not always been easy
in spite of the apparent approval of the courts. The
early judiciary looked extremely conservatively, if not
jealously, ulxin any practice which might intrude upon
the jurisdiction of the courts. And the early cases
indicate that from a practical point of view the deci-
sions by arbitration were really open to court appeal.
.Modern law has tended away from this situation and
the various states have adopted statutes, brief and defi-
nite in their makeup, which have greatly assisted par-
ties in keeping their differences out of the courts.
Analyzed from a broad point of view, arbitration
is found to consist of the following:
1. Submission
2. Procedure
3. Award
Submission
Arbitration is founded upon a contract whereby the
parties in interest agree to appoint a board of arbi-
trators; to present their controversy to the board: and
fmally, to be bound by the decision of this board. The
statement of this contract, together with the instruc-
tions to the board of arbitrators is called the submis-
sion. Since the submission contains all of the details of
the transaction thus far, it really amounts to the foun-
dation of the entire procedure. The agreement between
the parties must contain the four essential elements of
a contract. The parties must have a meeting of minds
as to the precise controversy to be arbitrated. There
must be a consideration in that each party believes he
has logical grounds for his claim. They must have
the legal capacity to contract and finally, the subject-
matter must be within the law.
The purpose of arbitration is to get away from the
rigid technicalities of court procedure, clothed ever
with uncertainty, and substitute a cheaper and speedier
method of settling a controversy on its merits. The
submission may be very informal. For instance, a writ-
ten submission is not necessary unless the subject-
matter comes within the statute of frauds. In the
case of Bush vs Davis, 34 Mich. 190, exception was
taken to a previous award through arbitration. Bush
and Davis had entered into a contract which resulted
in a controversy as to their respective rights. They
referred the matter to a board of arbitration which
granted an award unsatisfactory to Bush. Bush then
brought the present lawsuit to set aside the award on
the basis that the "submission" was too general in its
terms. But the court decided that the submission need
not be formal in any manner, and its general nature,
if definite, was quite consistent with the purposes of
arbitration.
There is a conflict in the law of the various states
as to the subject-matter of arbitration. The Michigan
statute, Sec. 2, Ch. 266 of the compiled laws of 1929.
excludes controversies involving the title to real estate
cither in fee simple or for a life estate. Some juris-
dictions, however, permit the award to pass title to
realty when the submission is under seal and duly
acknowledged. The case of McArthur vs Oliver, 53
Mich. 299 is an early case where the title to personal
property was passed by an award. The material con-
sisted of miscellaneous farm equipment, and the same
result would be reached in present day law.
Hall vs Kimmer, 61 Mich. 269, 28 N. W. 96. in-
volved an exception to an award because of illegal
subject-matter. The controversy was over a $300 fee
for securing a pension for an ex-soldier in face of a
federal statute limiting such fee to $10. The matter
was referred to arbitration resulting in an award of
$150, which the soldier refused to pay. The court said

By P. A. Cushman, Professor of Mechanical Engineering
RECAPITULATIONS in tabulated form appear
to IK: an undeveloped field for the improvement
of technical courses,—for the better presenta-
tion in a shorter period of time. There are a number
of ways in which the study of fundamental courses
might be facilitated by the use of the tabular recapitu-
lations. The tables may be used to present either ana-
lytical, graphical, or subject sum-
maries.
A tabulated course summary
gives students a visible conception
of the subject scope. A clarifica-
tion of scope is a most essential
prelude to rapid learning. Students
frequently fail to see the intent of
a subject and of its subdivisions.
They do not correctly understand
the relationship of the parts to
each other. A lack of understand-
ing of subject scope causes the stu-
dent to experience a certain vague-
ness in reasoning, and makes it
impossible for him to think or
study effectively. It is too much
to expect that the student can prepare a tabulated
recapitulation. This work should be performed by the
instructor and exhibited early in the course, probably
during the first lecture. The student is thus provided
with a systematic guide for study which he may use as
a measuring stick to gauge his progress in learning.
The tabulated recapitulation thus serves the student
as an outline of the proper steps of procedure in study
and helps him to create an interest in the subject. It
leads to classification of subdivisions of the subject and
the inclusion and correct grouping of all special cases.
The method of study thus evolved gives the student
confidence in the thoroughness of his mastery of the
subject, and provides an easy method for review. The
table may be so planned as to make the information in
each rectangle lead the reader from the known to un-
known scientific steps. This should be an aid to the
student in learning how to study. It should teach him
to think more quickly and accurately.
An especially important use for the tabulated method
of outline is to indicate the facts which the instructor
expects the student to memorize, or assist the student
to more readily form his own opinion as to what should
The general form of the pro-
gram of the Applied Mechanics
Colloquiaum consists of meetings
every second week at which a
paper is presented pertaining to
the interest of Applied Mechanics
by either a faculty member, stu-
dent or outside speaker.
An abstract of the paper pre-
sented at the meeting of the Col-
loquium on January 12, 1933 by
Dr. P. A. Cushman, Professor of
Mechanical Engineering, on the
subject "Tabulated Recapitula-
tions as a Means of Presenting
Engineering Ideas" is given here.

be memorized.
Examples of the tabulated recapitulation appear in
many books on English Composition, including those
by Edwin C. Woolley, Louis Wann, Easley S. Jones,
and the Century Handbook of Writing. "Effective
Speaking", by A. E. Phillips, pp. 222, 223, gives a most
interesting application of this principle. In the math-
ematical subjects of Thermody-
namics and Engineering Mechanics
the idea has been in use for many
years. In these subjects the analy-
tical and graphical summaries are
lx&gt;th useful and essential. Courses
in Descriptive Geometry, Machine
Design, and Valve Gears may be
made more instructive by the aid
of tabulated recapitulations. The
method is applied by Kimball and
Barr in their "Elements of Ma-
chine Design".
With almost any subject, study is
more readily accomplished when a
tabulated recapitulation has been
completed, because from that, the
student can work backward and attempt the deductions
of all expressions or ideas appearing in the table and
thus ascertain the thoroughness with which he has
learned the fundamentals.
On this one sheet the student has before him at all
times a vivid picture of what is being sought as well
as a concise statement of all essential conclusions. A
carefully prepared synopsis of the method of study
may be helpful in a supplementary way, but it can
never provide a complete picture of the subject, and
its ideal use is as a connecting link between the tabu-
lated summary and the text. We thus see that a com-
plete tabulated recapitulation is an essential aid to
thorough understanding of many engineering courses,
that is, it provides a plan for consistent study, and
serves a vital need in review during student days and
later."
Mr. E. E. Weibel spoke of the Annual Meeting of
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in New
York in December and that about a dozen papers were
presented in the Working Stress Symposium. He then

A Rubber Hydraulic Turbine Bearing
Since 1924, a new type of guide bearing for hydraulic
turbine work has been developed and used in an in-
creasing number of installations. This bearing, known as
the Cutless Rubber Guide Bearing, is vulcanized into
the casings by what is known as the open heat method,
making special molds unnecessary. It presents several
distinct advantages over the oil-lubricated metal bearing
or the water lubricated lignum-vitae bearing.
The two main disadvantages of the oil-lubricated
metal bearing arc (1) the necessary presence of a
stuffing box or water seal between the bearing and the
turbine runner, thus increasing the amount of shaft
overhang, and (2) the necessity for providing some
means of lifting the oil after it passes downward
through the bearing. These two disadvantages intro-
duce complications into the design of the bearing.
Since the rubber bearing is water-lubricated, it elim-
inates both these disadvantages.
The rubber bearing also has advantages over the
lignum-vitae type. Since rubber is resilient, it is easily
deformed by sand and grit particles which are brought
in with the turbine water. Whereas the particles roll
on the rubber, they dig into the lignum-vitae. For
this reason, the rubber bearing has a life greatly in
excess of the lignum-vitae type; and furthermore, it
prevents the grit from scoring the shaft.
Contrary to belief, soft rubber, when properly com-
lx&gt;unded and designed is capable of supporting heavy
shafts with very small deflection. Since rubber in
itself is essentially incompressible, the deflection in
Cutless Bearings is entirely due to the slight distortion
of the faces.
Several types of the Gutless Bearing are available.
'I he spiral-grooved type shown in the figure is the first
ever installed. Although installed in 1924 on a 1000
H.P. exciter of the Holtwood plant of the Pennsyl-
vania Water &amp; Power Company, it was still in use in
1932. The lubricating water is introduced in the cir-
Notes of the
Profession
iular space in the center of the hearing, where it enters
from spaces which are directly connected with large
ihambers provided in the bearing shell. The water
flows upward and downward through the spiral grooves
to chambers above and below the bearing which are
connected to the draft tube. Another type of bearing
has vertical rather than spiral grooves, while still an-
other is made in horizontal sections to facilitate ease
in repair.
There are now in operatiou 42 hydraulic turbines
with Cutless Rubber Bearings installed representing
an aggregated capacity of 514,000 H.P. The shaft
diameters vary from 7 to 31J/2 inches. Meanwhile
many more such are being ordered or are actually being
built by the B. F. Goodrich Rubber Company of Akron.
New Developments In Circuit Breakers
Not since the innovation of the oil circuit breaker
into electric JXJWCT equipment has anything in this field
so revolutionary as the de-ion breaker come into use.
The oil-circuit breaker which extinguishes the current-
breaking arc in a bath of oil replaced the carbon breaks
of the early days of power service, and has held the
field since then. New improvements in circuit-break-
ing devices have been almost entirely improvements in
the oil circuit breaker.
A few years ago, how-
ever, an entirely new fun-
damental conception of arc
rupturing was evolved and
this has given us within
the last few years radically
new circuit breaking de-
vices. The new principle
is known as the de-ion
principle and is based on
the fact that below a cer-
tain voltage an alternating
current arc will not re-es-
tablish, particularly if the
metal contacts between
which the arc is drawn are
kept cool or if the arc is
rapidly moved over fresh
cooled metal surface. The
new circuit breaker, there-
fore, arranges to divide
the arc into a large num-
ber of shorter arcs each
having its proportional
part of the total voltage

metal surfaces.
De-ion circuit breakers offer many advantages. In
the small sizes, for use as home equipment, they obviate
the nuisance and danger of fuses and furnish more
positive control in the home circuits. In larger sizes,
their advantages are even more pronounced, as indi-
cated by tests recently made by Westinghouse on a
circuit breaker of the de-ion type.
This circuit breaker interrupted the largest amount
of current and power ever interrupted by a circuit
breaker of any type. The breaker was tested between
the ranges of 50,000 amperes and 118,000 amperes at
7600 volts. This is from 380,000 to 895,000 kva.
single-phase or 1,140,000 kva. to 2,685,000 kva. three-
phase equivalent. Oil, grids, and breaker parts were
still in excellent condition and ready for further serv-
ice. This was due mainly to the fact that in 1/60 of
a second after the contacts parted the arc was extin-
guished. The arc energy was reduced, gas generated
low and total pressure developed in the tank being in
proportion was therefore negligible.
This is only an indication of what "De-ion Grids"
can do for new breakers. Due to their design they are
also adaptable to older type circuit breakers. It can
now be stated that circuit breakers are adequate for
any and all services.
High Speed Photography
A most valuable development in instantaneous pho-
tography has recently been made by Professor H. E.
Edgerton and K. J. Germehausen of the Department of
Electrical Engineering in the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. These men have developed an electrical
circuit and they use cameras for making both still and
motion pictures. By means of their work, it is possible
to make photographs at the rate of 4,000 a second
with exposures ranging from 1/50,000 to 1/100,000
of a second.
In the case of making still pictures where extremely
accurate timing is not necessary, a spark gap is used
to furnish the arc; but when motion pictures are made
it is necessary to time the flash of light so that it will
be synchronized with the speed of the film, which
moves past the lens aperture at velocities up to 200
miles per hour. This synchronization is produced by
a commutator on the film-driving sprocket which comes
into contact with a brush. A small current flowing
through the brush operates a thyratron tube which
releases electric energy previously stored up in con-
densers. The light is produced when the electrical
energy is quickly changed to heat and light by dis-
charging the condensers into the mercury tubes or
spark gap. By means of this system it is possible
to produce intensities of light approximately the same
as would Ix: produced by the light of 40,000 ordinarv
50 wntt bulbs.

The De-ion Grid Circuit Breaker
The device should prove to be tremendously valuable
in the study of physical and biological phenomena.
It has already been used to investigate the disturbance
pioduced when a drop of milk falls into a larger pool
of milk, and the distortion which a golf ball undergoes
when struck by a golf club. In the accompanying pic-
ture is shown an instantaneous photograph of water
gushing from a faucet. Its appearance is very much
different from the appearance of the stream to the
ordinary eye. Furthermore it is possible to study the
movement of rifle bullets, the flight of insects and birds,
the action of rapidly moving liquids and gases, and
possibly such rapid bodily actions as the knee jerk and
the wink.
Toughening Steel Surfaces
The hardest surfaces known to steel can now be
strengthened and toughened appreciably through the ad-
dition of nickel, according to a paper recently presented
before the American Society for Steel Treating. This
development should lead to an expansion of the use
of these steels, known as nitriding steels, whose outer
layers have been made very hard by a comparatively
new process. At present used in steam valves, shafts,
pump parts, and a variety of other applications, the
new nitriding steels containing nickel are especially
suited for applications required to withstand heavy
pressures.
The principal benefits resulting from the addition of
nickel to these specially-treated steels, the paper says,
;,re found in its strengthening and toughening effects
upon the hard marginal layers of the treated steel, and
itr. strengthening and hardening effects upon the core
by which to provide better support to the hardened
layers.
Outlook for the Automotive Engine
Recent developments in automobiles have been almost
entirely in the direction of providing smoother and
simpler operation. But behind the scenes of the auto-
motive industry experiments are being conducted with
a view to making radical changes in the automobile
engine so as to improve the operating economy. Inves-
tigations of Diesel engines, internal combustion turbines,
and torque converters have not yet produced any prac-
tical results, but have led to the discovery of much
useful knowledge on these subjects.
There is much room for improvement in the effi-

Tolerance, a Lesson for the Professional Man
A major part of any engineering student's education
should consist of some part of self acquired instruction
in the art of being happy though living in the world of
the ignoramus. If anything requires the ultimate in
self control it is to have to keep one's Wood at a nor-
mal temperature while a couple of uninformed but
self-appointed scientists are ignorantly discussing some
gadget or industrial system with which one is inti-
mately familiar. There is but little doubt that the
same thing is required of every doctor, lawyer, or other
professional man, in school or out. The ordinary lay-
men certainly have a vast amount of respect for the
capabilities of their untrained minds. Most every-
one has a sure cure for the depression and a prophecy
for the future unless he is in a position to know some-
thing of what he speaks. The small amount of infor-
mation that can be absorbed and handled by the un-
trained mind usually makes its possessor a know it all.
It is difficult to argue against the preposterous
statements of such an individual without hurting his
feelings and running against a stump because he isn't
even well enough informed to understand your argu-
ments. And the worst of it all is that the uninformed
"know-it-all" is so complacently smug and contented
that no amount of criticism would ever show him up
to himself. This leaves it up to the wiser heads of the
trained public to suppress their indignation and go on
about thier quiet way improving the world and con-
juring up new simplicities to awe the layman popu-
lation.
The inability of the ordinary layman to distinguish
and appreciate the difference between an engineer and
a mechanic frequently leads to a source of irritation
to the professional man. Most every engineer is a
good mechanic but mighty few mechanics know any-
thing at all about the reasons or fundamental prin-
ciples behind the machinery with which they work.
He can tighten up the bolts or put in new parts but
he couldn't make a new design if his life depended
on it.
The layman has no inhibitions when it comes to
imagining things. He forsees television in every home.
the broadcasting of heat, light, and power through
the air, interplanetary communication, et cetera ad
infmitum, and even goes so far as to present some
sort of ludicrous and asinine explanation of how its
going to be done. Proponents of socialism, inflation,
the St. Lawrence project, and all the rest, solve all
kinds of complicated problems requiring intelligent
leadership and knowledge in two shakes of the pro-
verbial lamb's tail and then have gall enough to start
arguments with real students of the subject. This is
what one really should call the quintessence of unmiti-
gated asininity and it brings up such a real problem
in self control for the professional man as to make
life difficult at times.
Meanwhile frequent and intimate contact with inex-
perienced persons will develop the engineering student's
sense of toleration and self control, a quality he vitally
needs.
The Smoking Room Again
Once more the halls and corridors of our dear old
Engine School are invaded with a lively discussion of
an old, old question. We hear the same old arguments
that we heard four years ago, four years before that,
and on back ad infinitum. We are faced with the
same temporary enthusiasms pro the argument and the
same old lack of get behind and push that has always
doomed this particular discussion to an ineffective
conclusion. It has always seemed peculiar how some
questions will arise, excite an extraordinary amount of
comment, seem to have worlds of backing, but yet die
uut quietly for lack of real leadership and decision.
This is certainly a real opportunity for settling the
problem of the engineers' smoking room for once and
for all. Just in case you haven't joined in yet, we are
referring to the time honored plan of making arrange-
ments for turning over some convenient room in the
West Engineering building to those devotees of the
weed who desire to study in the sacred blue haze.
There are several very pertinent arguments on both
sides of the question which should l&gt;e collected in an
orderly fashion and presented to the proper authorities.
But before anything definite is attempted the 1x&gt;ssi-
bilities of the plan should be determined in view of
the University fire regulations, made necessary by the
exigencies of insurance rates, and the need for all the
available classroom space in the college. A decision
could then be reached which will settle the problem
finally and completely. Most of the major organiza-
tions of the Engineering School are back of the plan.
It remains only for the proper one to come out and
assume the leadership which has so long remained
dormant in its decayed bones. If not it is to be sin-
cerely hoped that one of the two really active groups
in the college can find time to add another alien func-
tion to the lists of its other worthwhile accomplish-
ments.

the plan certainly should be worked out.
Politics
With the large amount of discussion of Politics on
the Michigan Campus, it seems timely to set forth
some of the characteristics and results of the system.
The author has been closely associated with the whole
system all through college, so feels his views are not
without some basis of fact.
In the caucus, the first step toward election, the
melting pot for individual ideas is found. These ideas
represent a commendable initiative on the part of some
men. This would all be fine, except for the fact that
preceding the caucus several groups of self-styled
political bosses have already grouped their ideas. In
the caucus these groups try by every conceivable method
of elect, treachery, and crookedness, to put their ideas
over.
The result of all this is disappointment on the part
of the defeated man, and naturally he develops a hatred
for those whom he suspects of cheating him.
What good does this system do, or I should say what
does it do? First, we elect class officers. For what?
To have dues collected to put their pictures in the
F.nsian. In other words we subsidize a whole class to
swell the heads of a chosen few so called class poli-
ticians. Is there any real reason or any real work for
these class officers?
This same argument can be applied to Student Coun-
cil, Engineering Council, and most other elective offices.
Few, if any, men elected serve a real purpose,
Perhaps the situation would not be so bad if the
political rancors stopped with election. However, they
carry on. There is continued back-biting throughout
the various organizations on Campus, and most of it
can be traced right back to political rancor.
Now the bigger the big shot, the more his back biting
ability. Suppose a man gets two or three positions in
a year. It generally is a measure of his ability to play
the game of politics crookedly, the more crookedly the
more effectively. Surely when he is a member of our
glorious Student Council, of our glorious F.ngineering
Council, and is class so and so, his head is pretty full of
an exaggerated idea of his own worth and ability. Also
you can't expect him to forget the tricky ways of his
path to his goal immediately upon his reaching this goal.
No, he must continue the part he has so far played,
and his only outlet is to try to "put one over" on some
rival organization. Here is the crux of your friction
between every organization.
I am not arguing that our glorious, exaggerated ego
producing, crooked political system, should go out of
existence. We must, I suppose, always have some
system to produce our revered "Rig Shots" for the
end and purpose alone of being "Big Shots." All I

wish to do is furnish you readers with a little food for
thought.
Engineering Leadership and the Human Equation
Many brilliant technically trained men fail to attain
chief executive rank because they concentrate so ex-
clusively on engineering and similar problems that they
neglect the study of the psychology and nature of the
men with whom they must be associated. They become
masters at the handling of machinery, formulas, and
materials but they remain utter novices at the handling
and coordinating of groups of working men. One fact
must never \x allowed to become forgotten. That is
that the world of industry is also a world of finance
and that, while seeking the aid of the clever engineer,
it is looking for more than just a high degree of tech-
nical knowledge, however profound. The men called
to leadership must have, besides intelligence and the
required amount of training, an appreciation of the
springs of action of men and the ability to direct and
inspire them to greater efforts.
This is strikingly exemplified among the large engi-
neering and construction firms around the country.
Without proper administration of personnel and direc-
tion of finances, these enormous organizations could
never be successful. It is simple deduction which
leads to the fact that they must have capable business
and financial leadership. And the majority of these
posts are and always will be filled with the better suited
talents of engineers. But it is also an evident fact and
an only natural occurrence that when a high grade
technical engineer with little or no developed executive
and business ability is competing with a high grade
executive without technical knowledge for an admin-
istrative position, the choice will fall justly to the
latter.
When a position of monumental importance is to be
filled, a Board of Directors looks for several very
necessary qualities. First and most important, has he
the required talent and ability? Second and of increas-
ing weight, does he know how to inspire loyalty and
handle men successfully? He must know men. the im-
pulses of human nature, and the ways of pointing their
abilities to the best interests of all concerned. In other
words; "With all thy getting, get understanding."

Slide Rule Dance
The one high-spot on the engineer's social calendar is
the Annual Slide Rule Dance. On that night he emerges
from his more sedate nature to don his old tux and give
vent to a feeling of exuherant gaiety such as only the
slip stick dance can afford him. At the Union ballroom,
he dances to the strains of a dreamy waltz (all blue book
worries banished from his thoughts) and the familiar
faces everywehere about him make him feel perfectly at
home.
The dance this year will be held sometime in the latter
part of March, and judging from the plans and prepa-
rations for the ball, it will be even more colorful than
its predecessors. Richard N. Cogger, 33E, of Detroit,
the managing editor of the Technic, has been chosen
as the general chairman of the affair and he and his
staff of committeemen predict that this year's affair
yiill rival any of the other big time college shindigs. It
should, it's our own.
The committee, as appointed by the general chair-
man and his assistant chairman, and just recently an-
nounced, is made up of several well known seniors of
the College. DeElton J. Carr was named Assistant
Chairman, Robert E. Hayes will take charge of the
committee on programs, favors and arrangements. Jerry
Gruitch will head the Floor Committee with Howard
M. Jones as his First Assistant. The Orchestra Com-
mittee has Harold G. Seamans in charge. The pub-
licity for the party will be handled by William Mohr-
hoff and his corps of assistants. Decorations will be
in charge of Don Lyon. The ticket sale will be carried
on under the direction of Paul Rauff, Chairman of
that committee, and John A. Goetz, his first assistant.
The date for the affair has not been definitely re-
ported but will probably come on the same night as
the Lawyers' Crease party, March 31. Tickets will un-
doubtedly be priced less than the $3.50 tax which was
levied last year, if the rumors which are coming out
from recent committee meetings have any foundation.
It has also been learned that no orchestra has been
defmitely chosen although Ace Brigode from the Cin-
cinnati Graystone, Hal Kemp from Chicago, Bernie
Cushman, Jan Garber, Barney Rapp, and several other
nationally prominent bands are under consideration. In
short it looks like a big night for the wieklers of the
slip stick and a really enjoyable affair. We'll all be
there, see you at the party!
Highway and Safety Conference
The foremost highway and safety authorities of the
state were in attendance at the Michigan Highway Con-
ference held in Ann Arbor on February 14 and 15.
The registration of nearly 700 members of the Michi-
gan Safety Directors' Association, the Michigan Asso-
ciation of Road Commissioners and engineers, and the
Michigan Good Roads Association signifies that the
conference was well attended by a very representative
body.
Dean Herbert C. Sadler of the Engineering College
officially opened the meeting with a message of greet-
ing. The direction of the conference was in the hands
of Prof. Roger L. Morrison, of the highway engineer-
ing department.
Many papers were presented to the session, includ-
ing discourses on highway safety, accident investiga-
tions, and railroad crossing safety. Howard D. Brown,
attorney for the automobile club of Michigan, investi-
gated and explained the assets and the disadvantages of
the present Massachusetts plan of insurance and the
Ontario financial responsibility plan, with the recom-
mendation that the group favor such a legislative plan
as the "A.A.A. Safety Responsibility Plan." This
scheme provides that any driver convicted of reckless
driving, driving while intoxicated, or other serious
offenses shall have his drivers license and registration
certificate suspended or revoked until he can furnish
proof of financial responsibility by putting up an in-
surance certificate, bond or cash. It also provides that
in case a judgment is rendered against him, he must pay
it and furnish proof of financial responsibility before
he can drive his car again. It seems very reasonable to
an outsider as well as to someone studying the situation
that the passing of such a bill as would hold the reck-
less driver more responsible is something to strive for.
Prof. W. Sherman Smith, of the Civil Engineering
Department of the University of Toledo delivered an
address on the outstanding needs of accident prevention
in Washtenaw County. Basing his address on an ex-
tended survey of local traffic conditions, he showed
that few accidents are caused by road defects, so pre-
ventive efforts can be more efficiently directed to other
causes. The misjudgment of the driver or his lack of
normal courtesy is largely responsible for our highway
accidents. He cited the elimination of ditches as l&gt;er-
haps the most effective method of reducing automobile
mishaps since 46 accidents were caused in Washtenaw
county because of their presence over a period of twelve
months.
Economic problems arising from road construction
and the relation of traffic volume to highway main-
tenance costs were the subjects for discussion in the
second day's meeting of the conference.

The Campus from the air
Dr. Frank F. Rogers, consulting engineer of the
state highway department, presided at the second ses-
sion. Prof. Roger L. Morrison addressed the group
and urged the extension of paved roads because of the
tremendous savings which could be effected by a com-
paratively small paving excuse.
In an address by Prof. John S. Worlcy of the trans-
portation department it was pointed out how the auto-
mobile owners of Michigan are paying $11,000,000
more than they should in taxes. The Michigan State
Highway Department model exhibit and charts were
used to illustrate this point.
In discussing "Unemployment Relief Through High-
way Work," W. W. Lavers, of the State Highway
Board, presented as evidence personal letters from
people who would be dependent upon welfare work if
road building was discontinued in their counties. Street
widening was proposed by Leroy C. Smith as a source
of additional labor. Mr. Smith is engineer-manager of
the Wayne County Road Commission.
J. T. Sharpensteen concluded the unemployment dis-
cussion by citing the 1930 census on the northern pen-
insula. He described the definite trends of the move-
ment baek to the farms which would be productive of
unemployment and poverty unless road construction
was continued.
The annual banquet was held at the Michigan Union
and Prof. T. H. Reed, of the campus Political science
department and an experienced city manager, delivered
the address. Greetings were also extended by the
University President, Dr. A. G. Ruthven.
It appeared that much was accomplished by the con-
ference in the valuable interchange of ideas which took
place and all the delegates were well paid for the time
spent here.
Laurels Co To Michigan Engineers
In a large group of young men such as the Engineer-
ing College numbers, it is inevitable that some will
apply themselves more to the welfare of their fellow
men and their institution than others. However, there
is still another type, namely, those who after making the
most of the surrounding opportunities, grope not in the
dark, but reach out even further and will not rest in
peace until they have achieved greater triumphs and
made more auspicious conquests.
A review of the more recent achievements of stu-
dents in our engineering college is certainly a thing we
can point to with distinct pride. Writings and works
in several fields, adjudged the best, will more tlvm sub-
stantiate our contentions and boasts. And to prove
the engineer's versatility, these had not only excelled
in technical matters but in instances had by far outcoped
works even in foreign fields.
The following constitute the works which received
national recognition. "Apprenticeship and Vocational
Training" a paper composed by Marshall Anderson,
Grad., won the Charles T. Main award for 1932 of
the A.S.M.E. Anderson was also selected to deliver a
message to President Hoover from the officers of the
society. Mathias T. Matzek, '33E composed an essay
on Goethe, the German poet, which won him the Carl
Schurz Memorial Foundation award. This work was
considered so excellent as to cast doubt on its authen-
ticity.
"Iron Removal from City Water Supply" and "Dy-
namic P.alance in Industry" written by Lawrence C.
Whitsit, '32C.E. and R. C. Mansf&gt;eld, '32M.E. respec-
tively are two first prize winners of contests sponsored
by the A.I.Ch.E. and the A.S.M.E. Much credit is
due both men for the research work necessary in com-
piling those papers. The best solution to a problem
gave George K. Hickin the first prize in a contest also
sponsored by the A.I.Ch.E.
Besides, Anderson's prize paper gives Michigan the
distinction of winning the award for two consecutive
years. Robert Klise, '31E, won the 1931 contest, and
according to authentic sources the Charles T. Main
award is characterized as the most important in the
engineering world for college or university students.

Attention Grads
Who's Where among
Michigan Engineers
Dear Alumnus:
The time has again arrived for our monthly rendez-
vous, and when I gaze upon this array of news from
hither and yon, it seems as though we are here in full
force. I s'pose you'll all agree that there's nothing like
a good old get-together to discuss old times. It is a
real source of pleasure to your editor to write these
notes, and in return for your cooperation, it is hoped
that you too may derive pleasure in the reading of
them. This is your section, Alumni, a medium of con-
tact between you and your former classmates, so just
send in those personal, professional, and society notes
and let's see how different we can make it. But I'll
bet you're curious to know what's happeneing around
the country, so let's cut short these remarks and hear
what they have to say. Are you listenin'?
1896'
We begin first in the much heard of city of Wash-
ington. Information comes from that city to the effect
that Charles Spencer, who was in the Civil department
back in '96, is now a supervising Engineer in the Bu-
reau of Valuation for the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission. He resides at 6808 6th. St., Takoma Park,
Washington, D. C.
Mr. William C. Coryell, from the M. E. department
of the same year, is at present occupied as a consulting
engineer. His business and residential addresses are
svnonymous,—1719 Ohio Avenue, Youngstown, Ohio.
1904
We now take a wide span and settle in Butte, Mon-
tana, which at present is the location of John R. Bart-
lett. He is employed by the Anaconda Copper Mining
Co., as Assistant Superintendent of mines. He can be
reached at P.O. Box 1357, Butte, Montana.
And now the Chemical Engineering Department con-
tributes some information. Mr. Fred L. Woods,
formerly a student of this department, is now employed
by the Textile Dyeing and Printing Company of Amer-
ica, at Patterson, N. J. His residence is 762 West-
field Ave., Elizabeth, New Jersey.
1905
Ohio once more claims our attention as we find that
Mr. E. Le Roy Gemmill is Vice President and Treas-
urer of Alliance Tank Co., of Alliance, Ohio. His
home address is 2749 South Union Avenue in the above
city.
1906
Here's a note of quite some interest. Just recently
we had a letter from George S. Fanning. It seems
that we had some wrong information concerning his
whereabouts. However here's the latest. Mr. Fan-
ning is in the employ of the Erie Railroad Company
as Chief Engineer. 3059 Huntington road. Shaker
Heights, Ohio, is his address. We regret our mistake.
Mr. Fanning, and keenly appreciate your letter.
We also find that Harry W. Schulman is now a
member of the New York Board of Transportation.
His address is 250 Hudson Street, New York.
1912
Back in Detroit we find that one of our Alumni has
deviated from his prospective field of Electrical Engi-
neering. However we take pleasure in announcing the
occupation of Ralph J. Daly as accountant at 411
Milwaukee Avenue. He resides at 2962 Taylor Ave.,
Detroit.
A brief article concerning Mr. Charles W. Doerr,
C.E., gives his business address at 1526 Frick Building,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, while his home address is
150 Oliver St., Takoma Park, Pittsburgh, Pa.
And still further East is William H. Harden in the
employ of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co.,
of New York. And you former acquaintances, drop
him a line at 90 Gordenhurst Avenue, Montclair, New
Jersey.
1915
The name, Detroit, also reminds us that 2921 Field
Avenue is the home of Daniel A. Lindow. Moreover,
the Saginaw Stamping and Tool Company has claimed
his services as District Representative.
1916
Gerritt A. Rutgers now works for the Illinois Bell
Telephone Company at Chicago, as the Supervisor of
Local Traffic. He is married and lives in Evanston at
913 Elmwood Avenue.
1917
A wide expanse of water separates us from our next
place of call, but there we are at last,—China. And who
do we run across but Mr. Shoo Tze Leo, an Alumnus
from the Ch.E. Department. Mr. Leo has attained the
position of Dean of the College of Science of the
National Peking University, Pieping, China.
The Ford Motor Car Company in Dearborn, Mich-

is married, has two children, and lives at 22680 Nona
Street, Dearborn.
The General Motors Corporation of Detroit has re-
cently appointed Grant B. Sturgis to represent that Com-
pany as a member of the general service managers'
committee of the National Chamber of Commerce. He
was also elected secretary of this committee. Mr.
Sturgis works on the sales and service section of Gen-
eral Motors.
1918
The class of '18 also has a representative in the Far
Kast. We are informed that Mr. Yu Chang Chen, also
from the Ch.E. Department, may be reached in care
of Mr. R. C. Chang, Natao Christian Institute. Great
Kast Gate, Shanghai, China.

1921
Here's a note concerning Mr. Stuart M. Weaver,
whose present address is 536 Saint Mary's St.. Monroe.
Michigan. Mr. Stuart, who received his M.S. in Civil
Engineering in '23, is the Superintendent of Water
Works in Monroe, Michigan.
1922
The research department of Simonds Saws and
Steel Company of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, has on
its staff Gardner W. Brown, M.E. Mr. Brown lives
at 65 Dudley Street, Fitchburg. Mass.
Also employed in "lab" work is Mr. Edward R.
Whittermore, a graduate of the Ch.E. Dep't. Mr.
Whittermore, whose mail may be addressed to 304
Riverside Drive, Ames, Iowa, is now occupied in the
laboratory of the Bureau of Standards.
1923
Midland, Michigan, is our next stop. Here we are
informed that Mr. Charles M. Ridgway is the Super-
intendent of the Midland Refinery of the Pure Oil
Refining Co. This business of oil refining is nothing
new to Mr. Ridgway .since he was formerly plant
superintendent of the Old Dutch Refining Co., of
Muskegon, Michigan.
And here's something in the line of shipbuilding. In
one of our sojourns through Michigan, we come across
the James E. and Edward C. Davidson shipbuilding
ioncern located at Bay City. Upon inquiry, we dis-
cover that Edward C. Davidson was a graduate of the
Department of Marine Engineering and Marine Ar-
chitecture.
1924
A recent announcement by the College of the City
of Detroit informs us that Dr. Arthur R. Carr, who
received his Ph.D. in Ch.E. in '24, has been appointed
to the position of the Director of the Department of
Engineering of this institution.
1926
We have also just learned that the Crucible Steel
Co. of America, has acquired the services of Mr.
Arthur F. H. Hartwell. His "fan mail" may reach
him via 1315 Woodburne Ave., Pittsburgh, Pa.
A brief dispatch tells us of Mr. R. M. Parke. He
is now located at 1611 Webb Ave., Detroit.
Mr. Roy A. Beatty has recently assumed the author-
itative position of the Bureau of Tests and Inspec-

department of the Westinghouse Electric and Manu-
facturing Co., the Truscon Laboratories, in Detroit,
and the Pulaski Lumber Company, of Pulaski, Pa.
1929
From the General Electric Co., in N Y., we have
notes concerning two graduates. In June, 1932, Mr.
Levine completed the three year advanced course in
engineering conducted by the General Electric Co. He
is now in the Engineering General Department of the
same company.
Mr. G. H. Watring also completed this advanced
course last June, and he is now occupied in the Works
Laboratories.
A very short note gives us the address of Mr. Fred-
erick W. Leffer as 12 B Woodgrange Mansions, Ken-
ton, Middlsex, England.
1930
Also in the services of the General Electric Co., we
find J. K. Salisbury. He is busy with the Outside
Construction Department, working out from the New-
ark. New Jersey, office.
And now we are over in Europe,—in Munich, Ger-
many, to be exact. Here, to our delight, is Mr. Charles
E. Staff, who can be located at Kurfiirstenplatz I/H.
1931
Before we leave these foreign shores, we take a last
glance at China. According to a recent announcement,

Our Alumni
Ora Miner Leland
'OOE
THE time has again come to relate to you the
experiences of another of the University of
Michigan's contributions to the engineering
world. The records of the Alumni Catalogue Office
and those of the Civil Engineering Department have
provided us with some very interesting information
about a very interesting man. It is therefore with the
greatest of pleasure that we turn the spotlight on Dean
Ora Miner Leland of the University of Minnesota.
The gentleman whose photograph graces this page
was born in Grand Haven, Michigan, on June 28. 1876.
He received his preliminary education in this small
Michigan town. After his graduation from these local
schools, his ambition drove him to seek the benefits of
higher education. He entrained for Ann Arbor and
entered as a Civil Engineering student in 1896. He
spent four years here and graduated with his B.S. de-
gree in 1900. At this time, the United States was,
or we should say had just been at war with Spain and
there was the usual post-war chaos which had to be
turned into order as soon as possible. So Mr. Leland
spent his next year in Florida working for the gov-
ernment in this connection. He then spent a few
years working on the Coast and Geodetic Survey.
Covering the Atlantic coast was no mean job in those
days of poor transportation facilities and a great over
supply of sand, rocks, heat, and swampy wilderness but
the young engineers had to carry on. Coast surveys
were only partially developed to the scientific exactness
and rigorous procedure now in effect so that those
entering the Government Geodetic Department were
especially pushed for ingenuity and cleverness. Maps
were more or less missing, roads were lacking where
needed in many very important locations, and survey-
ing was more or less of a grind. The country owes
these quiet, hard working, plugging engineers a vast
amount of thanks and appreciation for their unsung
deeds and energetic labors. The development of our
enormous network of industries and trade activities
was made possible only by a great deal of unappreciated
labor which most of us little know or little realize. But
it is to the achievements of such engineers as Mr.
Leland and his associates that we offer this small recog-
nition, such as it is.
In 1903 he realized his ambition to have something
to do with the education of engineering students, which
has now become his primary interest. It was in this
year that he was given a position on the faculty at
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Until 1920
he served on the teaching staff of this school as a pro-
fessor of Civil Engineering. During his stay there,
a good deal of his time was occupied with International
boundary work. He was appointed to this position as
an impartial member of a committee which worked on
the fixation of a definite boundary between the United
States and Canada and between Costa Rica and Pan-
ama. This appointment was made by the Chief Justice
of the United States. The World War also inter-
rupted his teaching career at Cornell University. He
served from the beginning to the end of the Great War
as an engineer. His first experience in this war was
in connection with St. Mihiel and Argonne-Meuse of-
fensive. He then became Lt. Colonel in the 303rd
and 314th Combat Engineers who stayed in Europe
as part of the Army of Occupation, carrying on recon-
struction work in the battle scarred towns in the war
zone. He was honorably discharged in 1919 and is
now a Reserve Colonel.
It was shortly after this that he accepted a position
with the University of Minnesota where he is now
Dean of the School of Engineering and Architecture
and the School of Chemistry. His major interest is
concerned with the education of engineering students.
From 1926 to 1927 Dean Leland was the president of
the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Educa-
tion. His work at the University of Minnesota is
recognized as being some of the most fruitful to be
found in Engineering Colleges of America. We see
that he has not only applied his work in the ordinary
fields of engineering, but that he has also been a great
factor in helping the inspired young student to make
his mark in the world along technical lines.
Dean Leland is married and has four children, Louise.
Walter, Miriam and Paul. Your correspondence will
reach him if it is addressed to the University of Min-
nesota.
It has been extremely difficult in this rather sketchy
review of Dean Leland's career to do him the justice
he deserves. However, we have made an earnest at-
tempt to point out the highlights of his exl&gt;erienccs
and to bring him and his work to your attention.
Thus we draw to the close of a great career. We
are proud to be able to count the achievements of
Dean Ora Miner Leland as those of a graduate of our
college.

0 0 ClOCK means nothing
to telephone service!
Bell System service must go on all the time. Day
and night, Sundays and holidays, it must handle
with speed and accuracy not only the usual traffic
but also the unexpected rush of calls.
To meet this obligation, Bell System men tackle
problems of many kinds. At Bell Telephone
1 .aboratories, scientists develop new kinds of
apparatus. At Western Electric, engineers find
ways to make telephones, switchboards and cable
more and more reliable. In the telephone com-
panies, traffic engineers devise improved operating
methods that make service faster, more accurate,
more dependable.
Result: at noon or in the dead of night, the
public reaches confidently for the telephone, know-
ing that Bell System service never stops.

OUR SOCIAL COLUMN
The big social brawl of the year was covered by our
roving social reporter and he brings us the following
interesting account. Mr. MacHinery, I might mention,
is one of our own breed, an engineer. Mr. M. E. Mac-
Hinery was accompanied by Miss Lena S. Wayback,
a member of the J-Hop clean-up committee. Mr. Mac-
Hinery was charmingly clad in a three-piece suit con-
sisting of coat, pants and vest. The color scheme
chosen was that of black and white. The coat of some
dark material extended half way to the floor, from the
waist, and was tastefully held in front by a black but-
ton. It was whispered that this was the coat that had
been worn by his father to the J-Hop in 1898. The
vest was sleeveless and met in front. It was gracefully
fashioned with pockets in front and held by a strap
and buckle in the back. The pants were also of a dark
material and were suspended from the waist, by a
clever strap arrangement, falling in a straight line al-
most to the floor. A white stiff shirt ornamented with
cut glass showed thru the vest in front. His neck was
circled by a Van Heusen, characterized by two needle-
like points extending out from the region of the Adam's
apple. Around the collar a cravat of some white ma-
terial was neatly tied. The effect was quite chic. Mr.
MacHinery also wore jet-black holeproof socks which
were held up by the gripping action of elastic bands.
They were keen.
Miss Lena S. Wayback wore the conventional for-
mal dress.

of the loan of surplus capital abroad, then we shall
have turned its investment in upon our domestic market,
the distribution channels of which are already clogged
with a productivity which they cannot carry under
present conditions. Or we may devise some way not
now formulated of directing this investment upon the
market in such a manner that it will not clog the chan-
nels of distribution—but that will require a policy and
procedure which would be revolutionary.
The third of these new forces is the most perplexing
of all and is the major cause of dislocation of the
secular trend. We have within fifteen years added a
new increment of technology which has so enlarged
the means of utilizing Nature's powers in production
that in many trades old standards of measurement of
the relations of the individual to productivity have
become obsolete. We still distribute social income
among those low-income classes which purchase more
than three-fourths of consumer goods and services on
the assumption that each should receive in proportion
to what his productivity was before the day of high-
powered equipment, while the actual productivity of
the high-powered equipment which he now tends multi-
plies many times his productivity under earlier condi-
tions. The consequence is an increasingly uneven dis-
tribution of social income and savings; investment in
production equipment more rapidly than effective pur-
chasing power is built up; unemployment; obsolescence;
a creaking and grinding of the commercial and indus-
trial mechanism; and periodically a complete break-
down with consequent distress and misery and psy-
chiatric disturbances of the collective mind.
And there are other problems of a secondary nature.
Many of the accustomed mechanisms of commerce and
industry are functioning badly under modern condi-
tions of production and distribution, and complicate the
dislocation caused by the major forces. Our currency,
hanking system and control of credit are no longer
adequate; even our concept of private property, which
from one point of view is a social mechanism, requires
revision and re-definition to fit the present stage of
industrial evolution.
These major and minor problems are all parts of a
great composite problem; and together they constitute
a challenge for the wisest and boldest and most ener-
getic leadership to a solution as comprehensive as is the
range of these related elements of the problem.
This leadership must be of a new order and engi-
neers must be ready to play their part in it. However,
not as engineers of the conventional type any more than
the economists who play their part can be economists
of the conventional type. Each must break through
the walls of the compartment into which too narrow
specialization has shut him and become a composite
engineer-economist—in fact a composite engineer-econ-

not by cementing together the fragments of a training
which has been first that of engineer and later that
of economist, or vice versa, but by a training which
has been from the beginning an integration of train&gt;ng
in both engineering and economics. But this raises
the question of the organization of curricula, consider-
ation of which is not a major purpose of this article.
The present generation of young men coming out
of our engineering schools and schools of economics
or business administration must therefore make for
itself as best it can an integration of engineering and
economics. The writer when at the university special-
ized in economics. He had the good fortune at that
time to live several years with a student of engineering
and by reason of that contact to frequent the halls of
the school of engineering. Later, by accident, some
twenty years of his life have been spent in association
with engineers and in the environment of engineering
problems. This combination has given him a vision of
what the engineer-economist of the future can be when
as student the young engineer explores the field of
economics as assiduously and consistently as he does
that of engineering—deliberately and purposefully, and
not by accident as has the writer. That generation
will furnish us real leaders to meet the developing
industrial problem, which is a problem calling for
knowledge of engineering, economics and politics. o
Prof. Bukovsky Speaks Before Pi Tau Pi Sigma
Pi Tau Pi Sigma, Honorary Signal Corps Fraternity,
held its first meeting of the new semester at the Union
on February 15. The high light of the evening was
a talk by Professor Paul N. Bukovsky of the Mechan-
ism and Engineering Drawing Department. His sub-
ject was "Communication in the Russian Army during
the World War," and proved to l&gt;e an especially in-
teresting one. Withdrawn from active service on the
front because of his knowledge of artillery, Prof.
Bukovsky spent most of his time during the war teach-
ing in this branch of the service.
He especially stressed the inadequacy of signal com-
munication in the Russian Army, in speaking of the
high importance of the Signal Corps in general. Cit-
ing several very important battles which the Russians
lost through poor communications, he gave details which
led to the almost complete annihilation of eleven Rus-
sian divisions, just before the war ended. In this battle,
an overwhelming victory for the Germans, all credit for
its success went to General von Hindenburg who did
nothing but carry out the plans of the general whom he
had just succeeded. Though they had achieved what
seemed an apparent victory, the Russian divisions
walked blindly into the hands of the enemy because of
their inability to establish communication between them-
selves and the commanding generals.
Technocracy
(Continued from Page 7)
those who like to consider themselves scientific social-
ists. The technocrats have enthusiastically added their
interpretation of technological development in terms of
this older fundamental theory. They emphasize the
importance of measuring goods in terms of energy
units. Their enthusiasm apparently has caused them
to forget many of the social implications of the funda-
mental theory. It has also caused them to use termin-
ology in a very confusing manner and to almost
flippantly cast aside concepts that would appear to be
indispensable. "It is witness to a profound truth that
only a few years ago was guessed at—that physical
wealth is not measured in terms of labor, goods, or
money, but in terms of energy. . . . Value cannot be
measured, it has no metrical equivalent." If these are
fair quotations it would seem that an intelligent l&gt;erson
would upon reflection, question them and desire a full
explanation of their meaning.
Their Theory of Energy Determinants has been re-
ferred to but apparently it has not been publicly stated.
As nearly as can be guessed at it seems to prolxise that
the right to the use of goods be given by a per capita
allotment of all energy used in production, expressed in
terms of energy units. The debit side of the individual
account would be provided for by causing goods to be
measured by the energy units necessary for their pro-
duction. The allotment not to be transferable and not
to be carried over from year to year, i.e.. allotment for
use only. It may be an error to even guess another's
theory in the absence of a definite statement, but it
seems necessary to ponder statements from various
scurces, and to make the guess if we We to get any
notion of what they are driving at. It would seem that
some variation of such a plan might be feasible, or
even necessary. Perhaps, even if time should show the
plan of the Technocrats to be ideal, another plan for
measurement of values might be necessary as an inter-
vening transitional development. A means of adopting
the plan is not suggested and this would seem to be
due partly to a neglect of thought on the nature of the
present social structure, and partly because it is thought
that the plan will have to be evolved.
We certainly have been given something to read
about, talk about, hear about, and think about. If we
are thoughtful we will take Technocracy as another
point of view that may aid us in interpreting our social
and economic life and in planning future action. If
we are cautious or charitable, we may admit, that per-
haps those who are expounding, after gathering and
correlating a great amount of data, are "away ahead
of us." If we are prejudiced we may point out all the
flaws, that we can find, and cast it aside as just an-
other wild, Socialistic scheme.

that a fee of over $10 was an offense against the public
at large, and because of the illegality set aside the
award.
Procedure
A common method of appointment of arbitrators is
where each party selects one member, and the two thus
chosen select the third. If one party refuses to ap-
point an arbitrator, after due notice, then the other
party may appoint the two. The submission may name
the entire board if the parties in interest are in suffi-
cient accord. The Michigan statute states that it shall
be sufficient if a majority of the arbitrators agree to
an award, unless the parties, by the submission, re-
quired an unanimous consent.
The position of an arbitrator is interesting. It does
not conform to the popular notion that each arbitrator
is the representative of the party appointing him. The
work is quasi judicial in nature. It rests on a high ethical
plane, and should be as free from prejudice as that
of the juror or judge in a regular court. This is well
brought out in the case of Moshier vs Shear, 102 11l.
169. These two business men had had a controversy
over the amount of a transaction, and finally turned
the matter over to a board of arbitration, with an award
of $1,100 which was eventually set aside. A second
board was appointed by the parties, which returned an
award of $705. It developed that upon the appointment
of the second board, Mr. Hubbell (of the second board)
immediately visited Mr. Stephens of the first board and
spent the whole evening discussing the case. This is
strictly contrary to the doctrine that an arbitrator
should receive no evidence outside of the regular hear-
ings. The court held that it was immaterial whether
the action had influenced or prejudiced Mr. Hubbell,
riid set the case aside on the basis of misconduct. The
arbitrators must be free and unprejudiced and their
hearings must be fair. All parties in interest must be
given full opportunity to present their case, and to be
present throughout the entire hearing.
Jackson vs Roane, 90 Ga. 669 is a case in point. A
controversy had been referred to arbitration with an
award against Roane. Roane now seeks to set the
decision aside l&gt;ecause a Mr. Vickers had been called
as a witness for Jackson after the arbitrators had an-
nounced the hearings were closed and Roane had left.
The court said it was not necessary for Roane to prove
he was injured by this procedure, and that the irregu-
larity of itself was sufficient to set the award aside. The
1/urposc of these rules of procedure is to insure jus-
tice, and is no indication that the boards of arbitration
are drifting toward the technical restrictions of courts
of record.
The board of arbitrators frequently consists of ex-
perts called in because of their skill in certain fields.

ing the value of a pier. The complaint alleged that the
arbitrators spent their time inspecting the pier and
preparing estimates, but never called public hearings
to hear the two sides. The court refused to set the
award aside, saying that the arbitrators were appointed
t(. decide the issue by their own judgment, and if they
considered they could best arrive at this by personal
estimates, public hearings were not essential. Both
parties were treated equally.
The time used in the investigation must be reasonable
under the circumstances. Twelve years was considered
unnecessarily long in a New Hampshire case, though
that time would constitute undue delay under any cir-
cumstances. No definite time limit can be assigned to
cover all cases.
The Award
The award is the decision of the board of arbitrators
and since it is a legal document one might anticipate
that it would be worded quite formally. For instance,
it might cite the submission, jurisdiction of arbitrators,
the hearing of parties, the submission and consideration
of evidence, and that the investigation had been con-
fined to the field in the submission, that the arbitrators
had agreed on an award, and finally, that the award
was a certain stipulated sum. But the very spirit of
the entire proceedings of arbitration is to avoid tech-
nicalities, and to offer a free and easy way of settling

controversies, consistent with equal justice to all. The
award must merely state the decision. The decision
must be certain, and it must be final. The dissatisfied
party in interest has always the privilege of appeal if
the decision is either not certain or not final.
In Connor vs Simpson. 104 Pa. 440, a controversy
developed over a contract for constructing the Chicago
and Pittsburgh Railway. The chief engineer of the
railway was the arbitrator between these two contrac-
tors. His award was worded in the alternate, granting
$131 if the contract had the legal effect of a "penalty".
or $752 if it had the effect of liquidated damages. In
other words, he made the award uncertain by not de-
c-ding whether the contract contained a penalty or a
liquidated damage clause. It was fatal to the award.
McCracken vs Clark, 13 Pa. 498, involved the true
boundary line between two tracts of land. The arbi-
trator made an award specifying that the land should
be divided equally between the two parties. But he
made no provision as to the precise way of dividing
the area. Again the award was held defective for want
of certainty.
An owner of a grist mill and an owner of a saw mill
held river front property received from a common
grantor. The plaintiff contended that the defendant
bad an obligation to keep the stream open and clean.
The matter was referred to a board of arbitration
which returned an award that, "defendants shall so
clear out the pond as to enable both parties to have
the full benefit of the water of the stream without
undue obstruction." The validity of the award was an
issue in Perkins vs Giles, 50 N. Y. 228, and the court
there held that the decision of the arbitrator was suffi-
ciently "certain." In other words, while no one could
estimate one year exactly how much dredging would
be required the next year, yet when the time arrived
the necessary result would be known with certainty.
Akely vs Akely. 16 Vt. 450, involved a controversy
over a title to realty. An earlier award was being
attacked on the basis it was not final. The court stated
the test of finality in typical New England phraseology.
It said, "the issue is, docs this award end the business
or does it settle nothing". The test is well put. It is.
in fact, directly in line with the purpose of the pro-
ceedings of arbitration to settle a controversy in a
quick and efficient manner.

cieitcy of the present-day automotive engine, the ther-
mal efficiency at present being at the most about 22
1&gt;er cent: the rest of the fuel energy is lost in the cool-
ing system, in the exhaust gases, and in internal fric-
tion. A fruitful field for the improvement of thermal
efficiencies is that of the small high-speed Diesel engine.
A lxissible variation from the present gasoline engine
is one in which the gasoline fuel is supplied not by
carburetion but by injection, in a similar manner to the
fuel injection of a Diesel engine. Still another possibility
the Erren system, is the use of gaseous fuel in place of
gasoline, for instance, city gas, hvdrogen, or a mixture
of hydrogen and some liquid fuel. For this latter possi-
bility, a thermal efficiency of 50 per cent is claimed. A
possible source of hydrogen is by electrolysis of water,
using energy generated at night by power stations.
As for immediate improvement in automotive engines.
Henry M. Crane, of the General Motors Corporation,
in a paper presented before the Metropolitan section of
the S.A.E., believes that the 4-cylinder car must soon
disappear from the market. The future of the 8-cylinder
in the low-price field depends upon how good a manu-
facturing job can be done. The public is demanding
faster, more powerful cars, and this necessitates better
balancing, a larger number of cylinders, and sufficient
power to allow the engine to rotate fairly well at 6000

Professor Hoad Addresses Tau Beta Pi
The regular meeting of Tau Beta Pi held on the
evening of Tuesday, February 14, was a banquet at the
Michigan Union. After a short business session devoted
to consideration of Faculty elections and the coming
Spring student elections, an address on the Ann Arbor
water supply system was delivered by Professor Will-
iam C. Hoad of th Department of Sanitary and Muni-
cipal Engineering. Professor Hoad gave a very in-
structive discussion of recent arguments in favor of
retaining the present well supply system as well as the
new agitation in favor of a change to a filtration plant
using the flow of the Huron River as a source of supply.
He gave a historical review of the development of the
present Montgomery Avenue wells and the Steere Farm
pumping station, went over the question of hardness in
comparison with the supply delivered to many other
cities throughout the nation, and showed that the topo-
graphical characteristics of the country about Ann
Arbor tended to point to the location of very abundant
ground water supplies. In all, his speech was extremely
interesting and developed many questions of vital cur-
rent interest.
The meeting of Tuesday, January 24, was addressed
on the subject of "International Economic Relations"
bv Charles ( )rr, a graduate student in Economics.
Tabulated Recapitulation

Soderberg of the \Vestinghouse Company.
This paper gives a general review of the problem
of strength and safety of machine parts. There are
a number of factors which the designer must take into
consideration: First, an appraisal of the conditions of
service insofar as they affect the stresses in the mem-
ber; second, an appraisal of the strength of the material
under these conditions; and third, a decision as to the
margin he will allow between actual service conditions
and failure.
Service conditions may involve steady, variable, and
impact loads, high temperatures, and complicated stress
distributions. The strength of the material must be
estimated for such conditions in terms of a very limited
number of direct tests, supplemented by some one of
the various theories of strength for combined stress
conditions and by methods based on known experi-
ments for steady and variable loads when they occur
simultaneously. Thus a definition for factor of safety
for any particular service condition is provided. The
determination of what this factor shall be is left to
the designer or company which has access to the re-
sults of previous experience or which is responsible
for the consequences of failure.
The next meeting of the Colloquium was held on
January 26, 1933, when Professor H. R. Uoyd spoke
on "Connecting Rod Mass Substitution."

Stress and Strains
(Continued from Pagc 20)
Saturday: Got up in time to join a cocktail party.
Went to Detroit in high spirits. Maybe it was a dance
we went to. Passed out early.
Sunday: Found myself back in Ann Arbor. Broke
into drinking party in Joe's room. Used twenty bucks
some place. It must have been those damn women. Got
to bed about 5 o'clock.
Monday: Must have gotten up in time for my 8
o'clock lecture 'cause I found myself wandering around
Angell Hall around noon. Mouth feels as though the
entire Russian Army had been walking through it l»re-
foot. Looks as though life was getting to be just a
vicious circle for me. Xobody treats me right. I'd go
join the Engineers if I hadn't flunked out of ther al-
ready. Well, maybe I'll graduate anyhow in seven or
ten years.
TECH-NO-CRAZY
I hadn't been in Sewage disposal class more than ten
minutes when Xipplehead rudely awoke me. Nipple
yelled, "I have it." We all surely thought he did for
things were beginning to smell. He drove Prof. Sai
Nothing to distraction with his constant chattering.
He kept mumbling, "I have it." We all tried to get him
to say what. By constant hammering him we finally
got him to say.''Sewage Disposal" and then he ex-
plained it all to us. Right then and there on the third
floor of the West Engineering building Teck-no-crazy
was born. We did with all respect to Sewage rename
it Teck-no-crazy. So you see, young fellow, Michigan
deserves credit for another masterful triumph that is
now driving the world to the cats.
Nipplehead was right, all our present methods must
go the way of all sewage. All our nickels, dimes and
quarters will be swept away and B.T.U.'s put in their
place. The whole world will go heat crazy. The price
of beer and dates will be ranked according to B.T.U.'s.
What this country will soon need is a good 100 B.T.U.
glass of beer and a good 1,000,000 B.T.U. date. Yes
sir, it will take a hot man to get and keep a date around
here. Men, the idea is to place our engineers. Not in
street-cleaning departments and gas stations but in po-
sitions of prominence. That's just what Nipplehead's
Teck-no-crazy will do. Engineers will control every-
thing. All the banks will be turned into Boiler houses.
Doctors and Lawyers will be dependent upon Engi-
neers to run their superheaters. Every young bride will
need to be instructed in entropy and every husband
will study adiabatic expansion. People will sit up nights
working their heat balances and the Mollier diagram
will become an important part of every household.
Nipplehead is now forming the society known as
B.U.R.P.S. and they will strive to bring up before
every low thinking soul the idea of Sewage Disposal
or Teck-no-crazy.

A. S. M. E.
The student chapter of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers at a recent meeting held at the
I nion presented Mr. A. X. Goddard, president of
Goddard and Goddard, Inc., Detroit, and chairman of
the Detroit section of A.S.M.E. in an address on
"Engineering for Engineering Students'". A large
group of members attended the meeting and they were
wholly recompensed with a very interesting and edu-
cating talk.
In his speech Mr. Goddard stressed the fact that the
forces of human life are greater than physical forces
pnd that engineering students must not become ob-
sessed with the fact that the world owes them a living
because of their college training, but rather that they
should strive to learn ''how to get along with them".
"Successful engineers have acknowledged 15 per cent
of their success to college training and 85 per cent to
their ability for cooperating with fellow workers'" he
added. "The intangible thing the engineers must know
is human engineering" said Mr. Goddard.
Marshall Anderson, Grad., winner of the Charles T.
Main award for 1932 of the A.S.M.E., also spoke.
He described his trip to New York during the Christ-
mas holidays, during which he was presented with the
£150 prize before the annual meeting of the A.S.M.E.

At a recent meeting of the local student chapter of

carry on the good work of the past.
Robert Garrison, President.
Thomas R. Coleman, Vice-President.
Frans A. Davis, Recording Secretary.
Jack Skinner, Treasurer.
The newly elected officers have quickly settled down
to work and at present are earnestly engrossed in the
administration of the organization's affairs.
Silver Arrow Designed By University Students
A new custom built model of the Pierce Arrow
motor car was designed by two students of the Uni-
versity of Michigan and is likely to be put on regular
production by the company. The various tests for air
resistance which were run on the model here in the
aero labs were conducted by C. L. Johnson and E. D.
Palmer, Graduate Students, under the direction and
with the help of Professor Felix Pawlowski of the
Aeronautical Department.
The car has been titled the "Silver Arrow" and is
streamlined to an extent never before attempted by
automobile manufacturers on thir rgular production
lines. The power plant is the same 175 horsepower

motor as used in the regular models of the Pierce
Arrow line. The car is guaranteed to do at least 115
miles per hour in actual test, an increase of at least
25 miles per hour over the non-streamlined models
of the same size and weight.
The students ran over thirty tests on the models
before the actual report was handed in to the Pierce
Arrow engineers. The suggestions made and adopted,
however, did not come even close to reaching the limit
on stream lining, according to Johnson and Palmer.
Like other models on the market a great deal of wind
resistance is unavoidable because of the necessity of
making the job commercially feasable.
The technical construction of the car is also inter-
esting. The body is of aluminum, hand made. The door
hinges do not protrude and the headlights have been
designed to eliminate as much wind resistance as poss-
ible. Tires are carried in compartments behind the
front wheels while the tail of the car is used for lug-
gage. Another innovation is the seating arrangement, 3
in the front seat and two in the rear. Power brakes,
which respond with full efficiency to only slight foot
pressure are also an innovation. Door handles are
placed in recesses in the car doors. The price of this
model, with its beautifully finished body, will be $10.000.

Technocracy Offer?
By Professor Shorey Peterson
THE following paragraphs were requested and
written while the vogue of Technocracy was at
its height, before Howard Scott lost his standing
at Columbia and Walter Lippman and others revealed
the slender scientific basis of Technocratic pronounce-
ments. Dragons already quite effectively slain provide
poor sport, but a mild interest may still attach, in this
heyday of the amateur economist, to a summary dissec-
tion of one sample of undisciplined economic thinking.
Subsequent and more extended expositions of Technoc-
racy leave unchanged the original impression, gleaned
from magazines and newspapers, that its principal ten-
ets are: (1) that business collapse and unemployment
are dominantly and inevitably caused by technical
change, (2) that economic control should revolve about
energy and its measurement in energy units, rather than
value and its measurement in money units, and (3) that
economic arrangements should be generally recon-
structed along scientific lines, with technical people in-
creasingly influential.
The first of these ideas, which has been strikingly
illustrated with everlasting razor blades and manless
rayon factories, has been widely discussed and will be
dismissed with a comment or two respecting its credi-
bility to the properly skeptical scientific mind. Explana-
tions of unemployment either in terms of the direct
mechanical displacement of workers, or as a phase of
general business collapse attributable to technically
caused expansion of output, market gluts, price de-
bacles, and sus1&gt;ended buying, are old familiar ideas.
Technocracy's contribution consists in its spectacular
illustrations and in its much emphasized belief that
technical change, under the price system, must produce
complete and permanent collapse.
Technocracy can be more significantly appraised in
terms of its second article of faith, the proposed substi-
tution of energy for value units. "Technocracy," says
Mr. Scott, "Makes one basic postulate: that the phe-
nomena involved in the functional operation of a social
mechanism are metrical." Accordingly "it follows
axiomatically that all processes of valuation are ex-
cluded. Value has no metrical equivalent." Our
economic vulnerability lies in the shifting value meas-
ure; "exact measurement is absolutely necessary in run-
ning our system." Economic control must be conceived
in energy, rather than value terms.
Such language seems to say that value must be ex-

eluded because it cannot be precisely measured, though
to mistake what is mensurable for what is important is
incredibly naive. This would mean that a man's height
and weight should be rated above his health, personality,
character, and intelligence, because the latter are difficult
to measure. Persons accustomed to precise measure-
ments in their work need always to be on their guard to
avoid rationalizing out of a problem its important, but
imponderable elements. But let us exonerate Tech-
nocracy of this charge, and credit it with the belief that
energy should be substituted for value because of its
basic importance in economic affairs. A responsible
scientific man has said that "fundamentally, everything
on this planet may be reduced to a consideration of
transformation of energy." Can this be true of the
essential elements in economic control? On the con-
trary, it appears certain that under any conceivable
economic system, control must be exercised in terms, not
of energy, but value.
The third lxiint originally mentioned, the scientific
reconstruction of society, cannot be discussed, for Tech-
nocracy withholds the specifications. The problem is
intensely practical, and only concrete proposals deserve
a hearing. Numerous other cults and isms are urging
radical reform, all believing that scientific insight is
theirs, and certainly disqualifying themselves no more
convincingly than, it appears, the Technocrats have
done. Our present economic structure, with its quasi
automatic control through the mechanism of the mark-
et, supply and demand, prices, costs, etc., supplemented
by a good deal of governmental and institutional inter-
vention, works pretty badly; but whether the better
policy is piece-meal tinkering, or a complete scrapping
of the whole affair, together with the substitution of
a new control along completely authoritative lines, and
if so what, is an intricate issue that requires handling
more in human than in technological terms. To hold
with the Technocrats "that any system which fails to
function is faulty in design," reveals a perfection of
faith in the possibilities of social architecture that his-
tory offers little to support.

Experimental Mechanics
By Dr. Franklin L Everett
Compression fractures

trating shear at 45°.
THE importance of experimental work in under-
standing the theory presented in many subjects
has long been appreciated, particularly in the
physical sciences. In the study of physics and chemistry
as well as in all the fundamental studies of electricity
and dynamics, in its various ramifications, one must
feel as much at home in the laboratory as in the lecture
room. All the physical constants that are necessary for
utilizing the theory are discovered by such experiment-
ing. Furthermore, it has been felt highly significant
that these two phases of the subject should be learned
together. All of our important engineering structures
and machines require for their design a thorough knowl-
edge of both the theory and experimental data l&gt;ertain-
ing to the subject generally known as the Strength of
Materials.
Strength of Materials is developing like all ap-
plied sciences in which there exists an interdependent
relationship between theory and experiment. All en-
gineers become familiar with the theory during an early
stage of their technical training. The investigation of
the physical constants, however, which they must use
has been left to a relatively few experimenters. The
greater number of engineers have had very little if any
idea of the manner by which physical constants have
been determined. There has been evidenced compara-
tively recently a trend toward a more satisfactory bal-
ance in presenting this subject, with the belief that
engineers will have a better picture of the behavior of
materials under load if they have more laboratory ex-
perience.
In our own work at the University of Michigan,
laboratory experiments are designed to parallel the
theory presented in the classroom. Not only does the
student learn how the physical constants are found and
their quantitative values, but he gains an invaluable
confidence in the formulas which he has developed in
the theoretical part of the subject.
A formal set of eight experiments has been de-
veloped which is designed to fulfill the requirement of
furnishing the student a picture of the physical behavior
of the materials* and elementary structures. The sub-
ject of the Strength of Materials is based very largely
upon the property of elasticity. Robert Hooke in 1678
was the first to put the idea of elasticity into useful
form when he stated the law which bears his name.
Realizing that the student should appreciate the impor-
tance of an understanding of the obeyance of materials
to Hooke's Law. the first experiment deals with the
determination of the moduli of elasticity of several
common metals such as steel, brass and aluminum under
tensile forces. Hooke's Law assumes a perfect mate-
rial which in usual practice is justifiable. Actually,
however, internal friction prevents all substances from
being completely elastic and this characteristic is ob-
served as a secondary effect. Fine measuring instru-
ments are used and the student immediately begins to
have respect for his experimental equipment and for his
data and results. These fine measurements of deforma-
tion are made by use of Marten's Mirror Instruments.
The angular rotation of the mirrors caused by the
elongation of the specimen under load is detected by
means of a telescope and a scale.
It is necessary to know, generally, the limits of the
elasticity of materials, the point of yielding and the
greatest or ultimate strength that the substance is cap-
able of withstanding. Steel, brass, aluminum and cast
iron are investigated beyond the range in which elastic-
ity prevails. The student learns the meaning of, and
method of determining, all these usual physical con-
stants. He. moreover, is able to see for himself what
is meant by the ductility of metals. The fractures in
each case are explained upon the basis of the stress con-
ditions which are present.
Non-metals are given some attention in the testing ot
concrete and wood. When a block of concrete is
subjected to compressive loads it is well known, that
sidewise expansion accompanies a shortening of the
length. The ratio of these unit changes is called Pois-
son's ratio and is a characteristic property of each ma-
terial. Precise measurements are taken on the con-
crete block so as to determine this ratio for concrete.
The measurements are made by mechanical lever sys-
tems embodied in Huggenberger instruments of Swiss
manufacture. These devices have proven very useful
in many instances for measuring strain both in the labo-
ratory and in the field.
The strength and type of fracture of materials under
compression are affected very much by the presence
of friction at the ends of the specimen. If the substance
is not free to expand laterally as the load is applied,
constraining forces act which cause a cone of the
material at each end in the case of brittle substances
to remain unbroken so that the block will stand a greater

blocks of concrete to destruction, one of which is lubri-
cated on the ends.
Some substances such as cold drawn copper and wood
show properties which depend upon the direction of the
grain of the material. Wood is observed to be much
stronger when compressive loads act axially than when
applied across the grain.
Another set of experiments allows the student a
chance to make experimental verification of his formu-
las derived in the theoretical course. The very good
agreement between the two methods of approach, which
usually shows not more than one or two per cent dis-
crepancy, provides one of the greatest factors for es-
tablishing confidence in the formulas in the mind ot
the student.
The torsion of a circular bar and its application in
the helical spring are studied. The modulus of elasticity
in shear of the rod is determined as the important
physical constant which permits an analytical verifica-
tion of the experiment to find the relation between the
load and the resulting deflection. A shaft, also, is
twisted and the strain is measured in the directions of
principal stress, i.e., in the direction of pure tension and
pure compression, which lie at 45° with the axis of the
shaft. From this data the modulus of elasticity in
tension and compression, respectively, are calculated.
A beam of rectangular cross-section is subjected to
pure bending by means of a couple applied at each end.
Strain measuring instruments are located at several
places, one of which detects the effect of Poisson's ratio
in causing lateral deformation at the outer surface.
The experimental stresses in each of the other cases are
found, knowing the modulus of elasticity of the mate-
rial of the beam, and by comparison with the stresses
obtained by the usual beam theory are seen to show good
agreement.
A small beam is put in pure bending and the radii
of curvature in Ix&gt;th the axial direction and the lateral
direction, due to Poisson's ratio effect, are determined.
The ratio of these radii gives the value of Poisson's
ratio.
A cantilever and a simply supported beam are each
loaded and the resulting deflections and angles of rota-
tion at several points are studied both experimentally

and by using the theory. The Reciprocity Theorem is
illustrated by placing the load alternately at two points
in the beam and measuring the corresponding deflections
at the other point.
A final experiment consists of determining the value
of the redundant reaction in a beam on three supports.
Both the method of experiment and of the theory are
employed.
Various equipment and apparatus have been devel-
oped for alternative or supplementary experiments.
The plan is to utilize aluminum for many experiments.
particularly in torsion and bending and combinations of
these tyl&gt;es of loading, because of its high strength and
its low modulus of elasticity with consequent large
deformations for low loads.
An attempt has been made to focus the attention of
the student primarily on the behavior of materials under
stress. So far as practicable, large mechanically oper-
ated testing machines are not used because it is felt
that too much attention is apt to be directed to the
manipulation of the machine. Whenever it becomes
necessary to employ such a machine, a laboratory at-
tendant is supplied.
The experiments are made so as to furnish the stu-
dent with a clear picture of the action of the loads upon
the structure. In the case of the deflection of beams,
for example, large displacements are preferred in order
to make a real visual impression of this problem.
The experiments described above constitute about
one-half of the course: the other half being lectures and
demonstrations. Tension, compression, single crystals
and the structure of metals are discussed as an intro-
duction to the first set of experiments on those subjects.
Later lectures on time effect, elastic hysteresis and
stress concentration are illustrated by a number of
models which assist in clarifying the subject.

The Law on Water Rights
.1
THE legal rights in the use of water have become
particularly important in recent years due to the
development of water power, irrigation and large
city water supplies. The expansion of these facilities
has shown the common law rules to be somewhat in-
adequate, and many states have departed from the old
English laws in the matter. The result of this situation
is that water laws in different jurisdictions are in con-
siderable conflict. This is but natural considering the
great diversity of interests between the various sec-
tions of the country, with irrigation and water power
developments in the west and public water supply
projects in the east.
The common law treats the water rights as open to
the enjoyment of all, with no exclusive ownership in
anyone. It was early recognized that one should be
entitled to the use of the stream flow across his land,
subject to the like use by other land owners. This
entire group of rights constitutes "riparian rights". The
basic rule is that each riparian owner is entitled to the
flow of the stream, undiminished in quality or quantity.
But an exception immediately is adopted that the upper
owner has a right to use such water as is needed for
domestic purposes. That is, the upper owner has a
right to the full use of the stream for "ordinary" pur-
poses. At common law this upper owner might use the
water for domestic purposes, even to the detriment of
the lower owner. It is not surprising to find that courts
of equity will enter to prohibit wasteful or negligent
use of the water. Certainly the upper owner should not
pollute the stream.
The lower riparian owner is entitled to the normal
flow of the water, not only as to the volume per year,
but also as to the volume day by day. Thus it has been
held than an upper riparian owner could not dam up a
stream to create floods for floating logs, to the detri-
ment of a grist mill at a lower point. The lower owner
was entitled to the normal flow of the stream. On the
other hand we find a case where a power company builds
a large impounding dam which holds back all flood

waters to the detriment of a lower owner who would
use these floods for the purposes of floating his logs,
or irrigating his land. It would seem, however, that
this lower owner should be entitled to his remedy. Yet,
it has been held that an upper riparian owner can use
the water for his mill at whatever hours of the day
suit his requirements, and such a disturbance of the
natural flow of the water is not an injury to the lower
land owner. It is the only workable rule on a highly
developed mill stream.
The upper riparian owner may change the course of
the stream across his land, provided he does not injure
other lower land owners in the matter of stream pollu-
tion or increased and decreased flow. This type of
case arises in the drainage of swamps, or in the build-
ing of new bridges which deflect the direction of the
current to the detriment of neighbors. Embankments
and levees in the south are also subject to these same
restrictions.
Of course it must be appreciated that all of these
laws are subject to statutory regulation, and each state
has so modified the use of water as to best meet the
public welfare of its own people. The many contro-
versies and even bloodshed over rights of irrigation
indicate the importance of the problem in the arid re-
gions of our country.
The regulation of "surface waters" is somewhat dif-
ferent. Surface waters constitute the run-off from rains
and melting snow. They flow indiscriminately over the
land, as contrasted to the streams which flow within
established channels. It appears that all parts of the
United States treat this water as subject entirely to the
ownership of the land. Thus a land owner may dam off
the surface water, keeping it all on his own land; or he
may even refuse to let surface water flow on to his
land from adjacent property. There are no riparian
rights involved. The question may arise whether a
farmer can collect all of the surface water into a single
drain and carry it off to his farm in one stream. This
type of act might result in a concentrated flow so as to
wash away valuable soil, and the courts have supported
recovery in this type of action. The action is based
upon negligence, and not riparian rights, however. Fac-
tories, for instance, cannot create refuse piles of chemi-
cal waste which will eventually be carried off by rains
as surface water. The same restriction applies to
sewage.

Waterway Project
By Paul J. Firring, '33 E
THK Great Lakes Waterway Project is one which
will, when completed, affect the lives of peoples,
both in the United States and Canada. It is a
vast undertaking and a costly one, not only in terms of
dollars hut also in terms of many lives which will be
endangered in its construction. Should this Waterway
be completed, there will be added, in a sense, many
miles to the coastline of our country and Canada. Cities
like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Duluth, Milwaukee.
Toledo, and many others will be for all practical pur-
poses, seaports. To some of the present seaboard cities
this seems unfavorable, but to the people of the mid-
west and western states who contribute a considerable
amount of goods to the exportations of the country, it
would be a dream come true. By making Chicago a
seaport it would be possible for the farmers to export
their produce at from 15 to 18 cents less on the dollar.
It would also make it possible for many of our manu-
facturers to compete in foreign markets.
In order to realize this dream there are many ob-
stacles which must be surmounted. There must be a
series of dams and locks, constructed along the pro-
lx&gt;sed route: the existing canals and channels must be
dredged and widened or replaced with suitable ones;
a Treaty, between the United States and Canada, con-
cerning navigation and power rights, must be ratified;
an agreement between the State of New York and the

Lachine Rapids, near Montreal, will no longer be an obstacle to ocean going
Navigation when the waterway is completed.
Federal Government, concerning navigation am! power
rights must be reached; and the Dominion Government
must complete negotiations with the Province of On-
tario, on whose territory the proposed power develop-
ments will take place. Granted that all of these
difficulties can be overcome, the problem then becomes
an engineering one.
The waters on which the system is to be constructed
may be said to go from Lake Superior to the Atlantic
in five distinct steps or stages.
1. Lake Superior drops 21 feet into Lake Huron.
Lake Michigan on the contrary is on the same level
with Lake Huron.
2. Lake Huron flows down a gentle slope of 8 feet,
through the St. Clair river into Lake Erie.
3. From Lake Erie the Niagara River carries the
water to Lake Ontario. From Lake Erie to Lake
Ontario there is a drop of 326 feet.
4. From Lake Ontario to Montreal the St. Lawrence
River drops 226 feet. This drop takes place over a
succession of five rapids.
5. From Montreal to the Atlantic, the river falls
gradually. 20 feet in all.
With the obstacles presented by these five steps
overcome, there are 1,244 miles of waterways. Of
these 1.244 miles, 947 miles lie in open lakes so it may
easily be seen that the problem presented, is one whose
difficulties lie in a relatively small area. There are at
present canals which will accomodate the average lake
going vessels and which could, if dredged and widened,
accomodate ocean going craft.
Of this work there has already been a con-
siderable amount done. Between Lakes Su-
perior and Huron the United States and
Canada have built canals and locks. The
American canal is both deeper and wider and
is also more modern than the Canadian and
is chiefly used by lake boats. The American
locks have a depth of 20 feet and are rapidly
being dredged to a depth of 25 feet. The
channel between 1 .akes Huron and Erie has
been cut to a 20 foot depth. Here also a
depth of 25 feet has been assured. From
Lake Erie to Lake Ontario the Canadian
New Welland canal has just been completed
and has a depth of 27 feet. Entering the St.
Lawrence at the foot of Lake Ontario ob-
stacles to navigation are soon to be encoun-
tered. The five sets of rapids have been can-
alized but the locks are only 12 to 14 feet

Profession
Devices for
Accurate measure-
ment of steam
turbine
materials
Where Millionth; of an Inch Count
When we consider that steam turbines attain peri-
pheral speeds at the blade tips of 15 miles a minute and
operate at a temperature of over 800° F., it is apparent
that proper selection of materials for steam turbine
construction is a matter of great importance. In order
to find the most suitable materials, alloys are subjected
to several tests, one of the most important of which is
the creep test.
The creep test is used to measure the elongation of
alloys over a period of several months while they are
subjected to a high but accurately controlled temper-
ature and a steady pull. Under these conditions most
metals will slowly yield or "creep", and it is the busi-
ness of the research laboratory to find quantitatively
accurate values of the amount of creep at different
times over a period of several months. The testing
for creep of steam turbine materials thus represents
the highest order of sensitivity and accuracy in all de-
tails of the testing procedure. To measure creep rates
of this order of magnitude requires not only the meas-
urement of extremely small length changes but precise
measurement and control of temperatures.
It is necessary, however, to recognize the limitations
of the creep test. For at best, the length of a creep test
is small compared to the time during which a material
is expected to give satisfactory service. Extrapolation
of creep curves is necessary but great care is essential
if large errors are to be avoided. A complicating fac-
tor is the effect of the previous history of the specimen,
especially in the case of alloys which exhibit age-harden-
ing tendencies. Structural change within the material
may considerably reduce or even overbalance the creep,
resulting in a small or even a negative creep. The dan-
ger lies in the probability of an increased creep rate
after the maximum age-hardening effect is passed in
service.
An Improved Cutting Machine
A unique cutting machine has recently been put on the
market which promises to save time and expense by the
elimination of operations which have been necessary
with previous cutting machines. In this new machine,
known as the Campbell Hudorkut (Submerged Cut-
ting) Machine, the piece to be cut is immersed in a bath
and the cutting is done by a thin wheel or disc rotating
at high speeds. The cut is clean and smooth, without
glazing, burring, or burning, and generally no further
machining or finishing is needed on the cut face. Not
only is time saved in the actual process of cutting, but
there is also an after saving due to the elimination of
further operations. Since there is no dust in the bath,
the necessity for a suction fan is removed. Automatic
operation of the machine, independent of the operator,
makes for cleaner, more uniform cuts, with closer tol-
erances. By making the cutting wheel extremely thin,
loss of material in cutting is held to a minimum.
This new machine is capable of cutting a wide variety
of both hard and soft substances, and practically every
material which has been tried on the machine has been
successfully cut. This list includes such substances as
metals, alloys, stone, asbestos, rubber, porcelain, glass,
bakelite. marblette, and phenol resin.
The Art of Keeping Cool
Within the past few years we have witnessed the
development of a new art and its rapid adoption for a
wide variety of applications, namely, the art of keeping
cool. During the past decade, the small electric re-
frigerator for home use has cut decidedly into the
business of ice companies. More recently, theaters have
used systems of theater cooling to attract customers
during the summer months, a policy which has proved
quite profitable. Still more recently, electric refrigera-
tion has been applied to the cooling of banks, office
buildings, and shops, and several air conditioners for
cooling and dehumidifying the air in the home are on
the market.
A likely field for refrigeration is in cooling passenger
trains, and a few systems have been installed. This
particular field offers many practical difficulties in the
way of development. The power equipment, for in-
stance, must meet unusual requirements due to severe
operating conditions and lack of space. The axle-
driven generator capacity must be about 15 kilowatts
to carry the motor and lighting load. The compressor
requires a d.-c. motor for operation while the train is
running, and an a.-c. motor for precooling while stand-

a cooling equipment of 6 tons capacity is required,
taking a 12 horsepower motor. Meanwhile, much ex-
perimental work is being done by many equipment
manufacturers. In the illustration, some of this work
being done at Westinghouse is shown. The complete
refrigerating unit in the foreground sends the refriger-
ant through the insulated pipe to an air conditioning
unit mounted in a dummy passenger car roof section
in the background. Midway between is the control
apparatus.
Nor is refrigerating equipment limited to the use of
electric power. Recent tests were made of a piece of
refrigerating equipment of large capacity using steam
ejectors. In this test a tank of several hundred gallons
of water at room temperature was frozen to slush ice
in a few minutes, indicating the great effectiveness of
this type of equipment. This ejector equipment is par-
ticularly applicable where process steam is available.
Finally, there is the possibility of using reversed re-
frigeration, that is, the use of a refrigerating unit to
extract heat from a cold source and deliver it at com-
paratively high temperature. Such equipment might
be reversible, so that it would be possible to heat and
cool a house with the same piece of equipment.
Much of this development is in the experimental
stage, but there is every reason to believe that it will
some day be quite practical. Until then, we must keep
cool as best we can.
The Unusual in Lamps
It is curious to know that among lamps of the incan-
descent type, there are more than 3000 different kinds.
Of course, many of these have unusual applications, so
that they are manufactured only on special order and
hence are rarely seen.
Perhaps the most curious lamp design is that of the
"Grain of Wheat", a lamp which resembles its name-
sake both in size and shape as can be seen in the ac-
companying picture. It consumes only one-fifth of a
watt. These lamps are used in doctor's instruments


Extremes in light
bulb sizes
Apparatus for

for exploring the insides of human beings.
At the other end of the scale is the 10,000-watt lamp,
with a bulb diameter of 12 inches. To operate snch a
lamp continuously for a year would cost more than
$5,000. This lamp is used principally in motion pic-
ture studios but also has applications to airport lighting.
Another freak is a tubular lamp, an inch in diameter
and a yard long used for pillar light sources in archi-
tectural illumination. Another lamp is used in connec-
tion with deep sea diving and exploring. Still another
and more familiar lamp is the photoflash lamp used for
indoor photography. A small quantity of explosive
powder on the filament in the lamp is set off by the in-
rush of electric current to produce a flare that burns the
aluminum foil which fills the lamp. The principle of
the lamp means that it can have the extremely short
life of only 1-200th of a second.
The Public Demands Beauty
In recent months, many manufacturers have found
that economy and efficiency in the products they sell
are not the only attributes in which the public is inter-
ested. Beauty also helps to win consumer recognition;
and as this fact slowly becomes realized, manufacturers
are exerting greater efforts to make their products
more alluring. In the past it was common practice to
design a machine around the working parts, with little
consideration for its outward appearance. Consumers
purchased on the basis of the quality of the merchan-
dise.
The automobile manufacturers were among the pio-
neers in this new aesthetic movement, for, through style
changes, they have made the motor car more than a
vehicle of transportation ;they have made it a possession
which fosters pride of ownership. But the favorable
attitude of the public toward the incorporation of some
measure of beauty into the design has made such in-
corporation an important competitive device.
Furthermore, this development of attractiveness in
the product of industry has extended to strictly engi-
neering projects. In the design of bridges, for instance,
much attention is paid to the appeal which the bridge
will make to the eye, and a considerable part of the
total cost is set aside for the sole purpose of making the
bridge more beautiful. Recently built power plants
show a very attractive type of architecture, far different
and far more appealing than that of old plants.

POLE TESTS WITH DYNAMIC LOADING*
Professor James S. Gault
In the summer of 1932 some special tests were run
in connection with the wind study research project
sponsored by the N.E.L.A. Poles were subjected to
a fluctuating force which caused oscillation similar to
that encountered during a storm. The purpose of the
tests was to check the effect of dynamic loading upon
the stress-strain relationship and the strength of the
pole as compared with the values obtained in the ordi-
nary static tests. Also the effect of fatigue was studied
by continuing the test for six hours with forces fluctu-
ating continuously.
Electric recording meters were used to keep a record
of the instantaneous variation in applied force and elas-
tic deflection. The force was applied by a guy attached
near the top of the pole. Fluctuations were caused by
a weight fastened near the center of the guy, which was
oscillated up and down with a frequency of about one
cycle in two seconds, since this matched the frequency
observed on the poles of the experimental line during
an actual storm.
The effect of fatigue was found to take place very
quickly, the pole attained a "set" in about one minute,
after which the six hours of working produced little
additional effect. A static test taken immediately after
the conclusion of the run showed that this "set" dis-
appeared after a short period of inactivity. The inertia
forces acting on the pole, due to the acceleration when
in motion, were figured very carefully and added to the
force as recorded by the tension meter to obtain the
total force acting to bend the pole. When this had been
done, it was shown that the new stress-strain curve,
after the "set" had taken place, was parallel to the old;
that is, there was no change in the modulus of elasticity.
This result was important in that it explained an effect
noted in earlier records taken during a storm. o
A GENERAL SYSTEM OF LOAD DETERMINA-
TION FOR AIRCRAFT*
Air Commerce Bulletin, Vol. 3, No. 14, 1932.
Reviewed by Walter F. Burke
The present tendency in aeronautics is towards a
more rational analysis of the forces acting on the air-
plane structure. With the increased fund of available
aerodynamic data from both model and flight tests, it
is rapidly becoming more nearly possible to eliminate
arbitrary emperical design methods.
Among the more recent developments in this respect
are two outstanding problems. Previously it has been
customary to employ the fictitious center of pressure
in determining the distribution of load between the
spars. Since the position of this center of pressure
is very difficult to determine at or near the angle of
zero lift, the use of the more easily obtained aerody-
namic moment, which is a constant throughout the fly-
ing range, is proposed. This will make the analysis for
all flight conditions be of identical precedure.
The second suggestion is in relation to obtaining a
design tail load on the airplane. To date the tail load
has been obtained primarily from the conditions of
balance of the fuselage and did not take into account
the aerodynamics of the tail surface. It is suggested
that we consider the load on the tail to be determined
from the force imposed on the tail during the entry
into or recovery from a dive at terminal velocity at
which time we know the tail load to be a maximum.
Since all airplanes will not be handled with the same
severity, it is questionable whether the pull up from a
dive at terminal velocity should be imposed on all
service types. For a large and less maneuverable com-
mercial ship, it is suggested that the maximum wing
load be obtained in a sharp pull up from maximum level
speed.

A Last Word
With the publication of the March issue, the
50th Anniversary start of the Michigan Technic
ceases active operation and turns over the reins
to a new personnel, the staff of 1933-34. Look-
ing back over a year of hard work and experi-
ence, mistakes, and successful accomplishments,
one is led to wonder if it was really all worth
the effort; for it took a tremendous amount of
effort, time, and labor to keep this magazine
on its feet, regularly publishing, this past year.
It has undoubtedly been the hardest year that
any staff ever had to pull this publication through,
and, to add a further warning, the next is certainly not
going to be a picnic.
But the outgoing Board has a great deal to be thank-
ful for. Backed by the strong enthusiasm and hard
work of a fine staff, progress has been made and a
sound foundation has been laid for the shaky structure,
ready to collapse, which they inherited from a line of.
to put it mildly, incompetent predecessors. The hard
work and effort of a full year has gone into the draft-
ing and acceptance by the College of a constitution, thus
putting the affairs of the organization on a sound and
known basis for the first time. A new, legible. properly
organized system of keeping accounts and circulation
records has been installed and a cleanup of all depart-
ments carried-out. The support of both faculty and
students has been gained more than ever before and
total circulation has actually increased in spite of the
times.
But only a bare start has been made. The work must
be continued with new push and new enthusiasm.
There is so much more to be done as to make what has
been completed almost insignificant. It's going to take
a great deal of courage and fight to carry on. Financial
conditions are certainly not improving. But strong
effort and vigor can do wonders. And the joy of
accomplishment in the continuance of publication for
the Engineering College of your Alma Mater is the
reward. More power and success to you, incoming staff.

Man craves beauty: this is a truism. Since earliest
times man has adorned himself and fashioned his tools
and objects of everyday use to please his eye. This
craving made him religious and helped to accelerate his
rise above the animal state.
Whether man's desire for the beautiful came as a
result of his intimate contact with and appreciation of
nature's infinite variety of highly organized forms, or

The East Engineering Building
from a knowledge of the fine relationship of form com-
bined with perfect function found in his own body,
matters little. The fact remains, he did find certain
qualities or attributes more pleasing than others. True
his first attempts were very crude, but sooner or later
he was able to achieve those qualities of beauty that
satisfied himself and others.
Now the point is this and it is surely simple . . .
We are living not in the Grecian age or the religious
age of the Gothic builders. We are living in an age
of science and invention and commerce, paralyzed
though it may be at the immediate moment. Condi-
tions have been revolutionized in the last decade or two.
We have discovered new materials and new ways of
working them, and it is astounding how few have
really seen the potentialities. The principles of the
old type of aesthetic art remain the same, but the appli-
cations differ to meet changed conditions. The elements
of design contributing to beauty are, however, simple
and not beyond the comprehension of any intelligent
person.
It behooves the engineer of today to study the princi-
ples of design making for fine appearance, just as it
is necessary for the artist to study engineering princi-
ples and methods. Both groups must cooperate; both
must realize we are on the threshold of a great new
era, and we must never lose sight of the fact that the
only art that is vital is the one that grows out of and is
related to, our lives, our needs, our materials and our
methods of doing things.
One needs only to compare the modern automobile,
its fine appearance and pleasing lines, with the types
of earlier years to realize what engineering has done in
the way of adapting new materials to the fine old
principles of artistry. Then comes a true realization
of one phase of the many which emphasize the value of
art in industry. Here is an added complexity for en-
gineering but one which must be acknowledged.

Our Alumni
Ernest Ben Conrad, '90E
THE spotlight is again turned toward some alum-
nus of the Engineering College in an effort to
bring to you some of the more interesting high-
lights of his life. It has been customary to choose
someone of the Alumni Group whose work at present
is making him well known. However, we intend this
time to present to you a man who is now inactive in
the business world but whose work during his active
career was particularly noteworthy.
The gentleman to whom we have reference is Ernest
Ben Conrad. He is a native son of California, his
father having crossed the Western Plains and Rockies
along with the rest of the forty-niners and their cov-
ered wagons. He spent his early boyhood among the
miners who had been hardy enough to make this most
difficult trip in spite of the innumerable hardships.
However, his father wished to present him a better op-
portunity for the better things in life than the rough
life of the mining town offered. The facilities there
for an education were, of course, entirely lacking. Con-
sequently, he was sent, by his father, to Ann Arbor
where he received his public school education. Immedi-
ately, upon finishing his preliminary school work, he
entered the University of Michigan in the Engineering
College. This was in the year 1886.
As was characteristic of the type of individual from
which he descended, his tasks were always completed,
regardless of their difficulty. He spent four years at
the University in preparing himself for the engineering
world. He graduated from the Engineering college in
1890.
His next nine years were spent in working at what-
ever job he could get. He spent most of his time getting
valuable experience as a draftsman and designer while
he waited patiently for an opening in the field in which
he was most interested. Distance seemed to make lit-
tle difference as long as he could fulfill his ambitions
by travel, which in that age was a hardship. In the
year 1899, he saw an opening which he promptly took.
It was in that year that he took a position with the
Elco Works of the Electric Boat Company at Bayonne,
New Jersey. His dogged ambition to succeed finally
won him a position as Superintendent and Purchasing
Agent which he retained until 1928 when he retired
from active business.
We think it is fitting at this time to make some men-
tion of his admirable work during the country's time of
need. A review of his work in this capacity will again
bring out an excellent quality in Mr. Conrad's charac-
ter which remains constantly in evidence throughout
his life. The Allied nations were struck with the neces-
sity of producing materials for use in the Great War.
Mr. Conrad was called on by the English and United
States Governments to supervise the construction of a
large number of submarine chasers which were needed
as soon as they could possibly be built. He supervised
the construction of over 722 of such craft which went
into immediate use in the Allied Naval service. The
most remarkable part of his work at this time was
setting an astonishing record for speed in the con-
struction of these boats. He took the order from the
British Government for 500 of these small fast ships
and delivered them in 485 days, which amounts to over
one per day. The task was enormous but his inability
to be "scared out" by a gigantic proposition won him
fame.
Mr. Conrad has always been active in community
welfare, church, and Y.M.C.A. affairs and has spent a
great deal of his time working at this hobby of his.
It is apparent that it is his desire to try to give as many
children as he can an equal start in life toward making
themselves desirable citizens. »
Since his retirement, he has spent a great deal of time
in Florida and California with his wife. His trips
through the semi-tropical part of the United States
have given him a great deal of pleasure. He still gets
a thrill out of visiting his native California and viewing
there the changes which have taken place since he
romped over the rugged country as a boy. He makes
his permanent residence in Chillicothe. Ohio, where his
son and grandchildren reside. His son, Loyal R. Conrad
also attended the University of Michigan, having re-
ceived his Master's Degree in Engineering in 1920 and
his Doctor's degree in 1931.
It has been a real pleasure for us to be able to tell yon
something about one of the real "old timers" of the
Engineering College. We thought it might be a source
of pleasure to you also to read of one who has made
his mark in the world but who is no longer actively
engaged in business. We hope also that we have re-
called to Mr. Conrad some of the more pleasant memo-
ries of his student days. Space prevents us from
saying further, so we again shut off the spotlight and
wish Mr. Ernest Ben Conrad, '90E, the best of luck
and health.

Wooden soldiers
in the war against decay
To conquer the forces of decay which attack
telephone poles, scientists of Bell Telephone Lab-
oratories carry on a relentless campaign.
They study many kinds of wood, test many
preservatives. They isolate wood destroying fungi
and insects—study them in the laboratory—search
for a practical means of combating their attack.
They have set out armies of stub poles in Mis-
sissippi, Colorado and New Jersey where altitude,
climate and soil vary widely. At regular intervals
they inspect these poles to learn which woods and
preservatives are best.
Such scientific thoroughness — found in all
phases of telephone work — is one reason why
Bell System plant becomes more efficient each year.
And why telephone service is so dependable.

Stresses and Strains is really and truly delighted at
the response which it has elicited. Ever since this col-
umn was begun (with the intention of offering the
discrimminating public something gloriously rotten)
Stresses and Strains has been deluged with bags upon
bags upon BAGS of mail from all parts of the world
where Stresses and Strains has penetrated.
We, of the Stresses and Strains have conscientiously
undertaken to read this assorted muck, with the re-
sult that our respective digestions have been seriously
impaired. To give you readers an idea of what you
think of our column we offer you a digested resume of
23 bags we just went thru.
A Chinaman wrote us and said, "You are allee
screwy". It seems that Stresses and Strains has pene-
trated the Oriental atmosphere and strained the China-
men's minds. From the letter we got the impression
that the Chinamen are getting the impression that
Michigan Students are screwy. Well, what else can
you expect when we are required to put up with Closed

Question. Name and discuss losses in pipe lines.
Answer. Friction losses. These occur when the
water rubs against the pipe. To prevent rubbing buy
Edgeworth Ready Rubbed. 15c a tin.
Bend losses. These occur when the water bends.
(Didn't ya? Well, I never saw it bend either.) These
can be removed by cold working or by dancing with the
bend at the Union.
Nozzle losses. These occur when the nozzle is too
large and can be prevented by using a large handker-
chief and blowing three short blasts, followed by one
long one. Wipe well.
Contraction losses. These occur when the water
contracts. (Boy. what an answer!) They are best
prevented by seeing Prof. Sadler and breaking the con-
tract.
Discharge losses. The best thing to do here is to
say. "You can't fire me, I quit!"

EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS
(Continued from page 7)
Several recently devclop«l research projects such as
the fatigue of metals, behavior of metals at high
temperatures and photoelasticity are discussed. Each
subject is well augmented by slides. The research labo-
ratory is visited so that each student sees the various
pieces of apparatus and has their action demonstrated
to him. Each of these subjects is of wide and growing
importance at the present time.
Various strength theories and working stresses are
discussed. In parallel with the theory given in the
accompanying course in Strength of Materials, some
demonstrations of the budding of columns are made.
The critical load is found both by use of the theory and
by experiment.
An im1x&gt;rtant feature of the course is a manual which
has been prepared so as to embody several principles.
The description of each experiment is contained in the
manual so that the student may read over the material
which he is to cover in the laboratory. It provides a
means of keeping lecture notes, experimental data.
curves and calculations in a logical and orderly manner.
It is believed that one advantage of the manual lies in
eliminating a large amount of the laborious work of
report writing. The data and computation sheets are
organized so that the student is able to enter his obser-
vations and calculations in columns and spaces with the
proper headings already prepared. More ground can
be covered in the course by this method, and the student
does not lose sight of the relative importance of under-
standing the physical behavior of the materials or
structures he is studying. At the same time he learns
the form of a well-organized report.
The exl&gt;erimental course in the mechanics of mate-
rials is designed to furnish the student with a clear
picture of the behavior of materials under load, how the
important physical constants are determined, and the
action of elementary structures subjected to loads.
Moreover, he is introduced to recent research problems
in mechanics, and methods of studying them. Finally,
he gains confidence in the formulas derived by theoreti-
cal considerations.
CREAT LAKES WATERWAY PROJECT

deep. From Montreal to the Atlantic there is a ship
channel 30 feet deep which is to be dredged to 35 feet
in the near future. All in all the problem is mainly
one of adapting the existing canals, channels and locks
for ocean going vessels.
Aside from the fact that this development would
mean a great deal to the mid western states, it would be
a source of about two million horsepower. This power
would be developed in plants to be situated at the '.lams
which are to be constructed and is to be distributed be-
tween Canada and the United States.
The American and Canadian engineers differ in the
way in which this power should be developed. The
Americans favor a one stage plan, that is. the construc-
tion of one dam at Barnhardt Island below the first
three of the five rapids. The dam would be 85 feet
high and would raise the river practically to the level
of Lake Ontario. Only one set of locks would be
required.
The American Scheme is the bolder and least ex-
pensive but the Canadian plan is the more practical
because in case of damage to one of the locks, traffic
would not be held up altogether and another more im-
portant aspect is that of being able to hold back the
waters in case of damage and therefore to prevent a
flood. The Canadian plan seems to be the most favored
and probably will be the one that will be used in spite
of the fact that it is more expensive.
The Canadian engineers favor a two stage Flan with
a low dam at Crysler Island 94 miles below Lake On-
tario and a main dam at Barnhart Island 21 miles
farther down.
The plan to be a successful one will need the cooper-
ation of lxith the United States and the Dominion
Governments. The cost of the project will be about
221 million dollars and will need at least 8 years to
be completed. From the looks of things at the present
time the two countries are quite determined that the
Waterway should be carried to completion because they
are both improving their canals and channels and are
making extensive surveys of the ground.

(Continued from page 5)
But a still larger problem of economic control is the
determination of what products to produce, and in what
amounts, in view of the behavior of demand, the scarc-
ity of factors, and the importance of leisure. Knergy
expenditures on different products bear no relation ui
the qualities which actuate their production. On an
energy basis a leading invention would rate low beside
the result obtained through moving a Vermont granite
quarry to Michigan and moving it back again. If this
is palpably absurd; so is the conception of economic
guidance in energy rather than value terms. In assaying
the energy content of a pound of coal, truly ''it matters
not a rap what men think, wish, or desire;" but what of
it? In devoting coal and other factors to human ends, it
is unit importance to man. or value, that matters,
whether organization be on the basis of free ex-
change and the price system or a communistic dictator-
ship. A little reflection will indicate, moreover, that it
is only because values are unlike a "unit of work or
heat" which "is the same in 1900. 1929. 1933. or tln-
Year 2000." but are responsive changing conditions, xhat
they are qualified to play their basic economic role.
Some commentators on Technocracy apparently infer
a less preposterous meaning, believing that what is
meant is not a substitution of energy for value, but
merely the substitution of units of gold in fixing the
value of the dollar, in which other values are measured.
This is suggested by the talk of energy tickets and
"electrical dollars." Technocracy would thus join that
group of conservative economists who long have held
that violent price-level changes could be prevented by
discarding the gold standard in favor of some kind of
stabilized dollar. Such proposals need not be discussed.
It is enough to remark that economic control through
the price system would remain, the prime object of
Technocracy's liberal denunciations. More than mere
monetary reform must he meant. If statements that
"the phenomena involved in the functional operation
of a social mechanism are metrical." whereas value is
not. and that "all processes of valuation are excluded."
mean anything at all. and are uttered by persons with
some sense of responsibility in the use of words, the
conclusion is inescapable that Technocracy basically mis-
conceives the essential problems of economic control.
Superficially it may appear that Technocracy has done
good service in popularizing the idea of increased par-
ticipation of engineers in economic affairs: but the
actual effect is probably quite the opposite. If the man-
ner of science is manifest in the broad generalizations
of the Technocrats in diagnosing conditions, their vast
assurance in establishing postulates, and their free de-
nunciation of other viewpoints, sober-minded people
will want little of that sort of thing. Between the
physical facts produced by an energy survey—the re-
search job of Technocracy—-and sweeping conclusions
as to economic conditions and policy, there intervenes
a broad gulf of intricate relationships requiring careful
untangling. Perhaps no more fatuous attempt at eco-
nomic analysis can be found than the Technocracy art-
icle in the January Harpers, with its highlights on the
subject of indebtedness developing the proposition,
found also in the writings of Mr. Scott himself, that
"in a price system wealth is produced only by the cre-
ation of debt." The great seriousness of the debt
burden does not excuse a garbled analysis of it. The
writer wonders whether leading engineering societies
are well advised, as relx&gt;rted in the press, in supporting
a proposed Congressional limitation of working hours,
certain leading arguments for which are undoubtedly
quite unsound.

Large cities are vitally interested in subterranean
waters. They want to know how far they can protect
the purity of this underground water, and what liabil-
ities to others may result from forced pumping of their
city wells. The law is generally analyzed in two ways.
If the underground water is following a defmite chan-
nel, it is subject to the normal requirements of riparian
rights, and any injured riparian owner may complain.
On the other hand, if the water is like surface water,
with no more source and direction than rain or melting
snow, it is termed "percolating" water and is subject
to the restrictions of reasonable use, pollution, malice,
and possibly, waste or negligence.
An entire law suit may turn on whether the ground
water is flowing in a definite channel, or merely perco-
lating from place to place. Suffice it to mention that
this is an engineering problem of no small import,
and one rather difficult of proof.
In Clinchfield Coal vs Compton, 148 Va. 437, 139
S.E. 308, the controversy centered on the definition of
percolating ground water. The facts showed the min-
ing company to have so constructed their tunnels that
there was a cave-in. It was claimed that this cave-in
cut off the flow of water to Compton's spring. But the
court found that the water was not following any defi-
nite underground channel. It was merely percolating

through the various cracks of the sandstone of the
mountain with the result that the flow was merely a
seepage. It was held that the coal company had no
responsibility for the tunnel cave-in on its own proper-
ty. Of course the decision would have been for Comp-
tcn if the underground water had traveled a single, well
defined, water channel. The court emphasized that the
burden of proof rested with Compton to prove that this
underground water was flowing in a definite channel.
The presumption is that all such waters are merely
percolating. It stated certain tests for an underground
stream which are, 1. Vegetation over the stream, peculi-
ar to water-bearing soil, but absent from other places
in the vicinity, 2. Ground sunken over the channel.
3. Stream appearing and disappearing from time to
time. It is evident that the money involved in the
average case hardly warrants a full scientific study of
all underground water movements.
The tests shown in these cases look somewhat in-
definite, and it seems that the law should be established
on a more precise basis. This lack of stability offers too
great a hazard for conservative business activity.
The case of Shenk vs City of Ann Arbor, 163 X.\V.
109 is based upon the "reasonable user" test. The city
constructed a well 16 feet in diameter on its property
known as the Steere Farm, and installed large pumps
to secure about 4,000,000 gallons per day. Test runs
were made for about two months, with the result that
farmer's wells were lowered in a large territory, even
for a distance of a mile. The plaintiff owns one of
these wells so alfected and won the present case, based
upon the "reasonable use" test. The evidence contained
extensive expert testimony regarding the gravel beds
throughout the Ann Arbor area, with their general
inclination to the Southwest, rates of flow. etc. It
seemed at first as though the decision would turn on
the test of percolation. But the court strictly limited
the effect of all of this testimony. It stated that the
water was not to be used on the land where the well
was located, but was to be taken three miles away to
the city of Ann Arbor. This was not a reasonable use
of the water. In the second place, the city was using
large pumps and forcing the water flow, which again
was not a reasonable use of the water. At this point
it cited with approval the change in the law which had
taken place in New York as brought out in the mineral
well cases of Saratoga Springs. The New York rules
prohibited the wasteful forced pumping of mineral
wells and gas in that territory. This reasonable user
test was a complete reversal of earlier law in New York.
The cases cited are all of comparatively recent date.
They represent but a fraction of the many water con-
troversies appearing in the courts. There seems to be
a fortunate tendency toward uniformity in the decisions,
although it is quite clear that the varied industrial in-
terests of the several states will preclude any uniform
code of laws on the subject.

The roaring stream of burning gas and oil is coming from a well on
the far side of the derrick through which it is viewed. This is a gasser
at Bellevue, California, which took fire and was eventually extinguished.
A courageous workman, protected by air blowers and streams of water,
crouched at the opening of the well and electrically welded into place
a high-pressure pipe which diverted the flow of gas from the flames.

Vocational Training,
and Industry
By Marshall Anderson, Graduate Student

ONLY occasionally does one stop to think of the
part which apprenticeship has taken in the
growth and development of the modern stand-
ards of industrial and civil life. Too often one marvels
at the great accomplishments which have been made
without looking also at the training which has made
them possible. Apprenticeship stands, like a sentinel,
on the bridge bctween youth and manhood, at the key
position of life. Since it is during this transition that
men prepared to assume the responsibilities which so-
ciety imposes, the success or failure of apprentice train-
ing is of vital importance to industry and to the nation.
An intelligent study of apprenticeship requires a
background of history and a recognition of the dis-
tinction, in modern life, between
the apprenticeship of education
and that of vocational training.
After a brief consideration of
these aspects of the topic, there
is presented in this paper a dis-
cussion of some of the broad ef-
fects of lx&gt;th education and vo-
cational training upon industry
and of their combined effect up-
on community life.
History
Apprenticeship began in the
middle ages soon after the crafts-
men's guilds of that time came to be recognized. It was
the natural outgrowth of the neeed for training young
men to enter the trades and for giving them formal
recognition. As the system took shape traditions grew
up and laws were made which required a contract to be
drawn up between the apprentice and his master. Under
the terms of such an agreement the lad promised to
serve his master faithfully in anything which he was
told to do and in return for these services the master
Once again we are glad to be
able to bring to your attention
a prize winning article. This
paper, in a somewhat longer
form, won first prize in a na-
tional essay contest conducted
by the A.S.M.E. and won for
its author, among other honors,
a trip to New York and Wash-
ington.
agreed not only to teach the youth a trade, but to keep
him, feed him, and clothe him as well. The period of
time during which such contracts were in effect was
commonly seven years. At the end of his apprentice-
ship the young man was given a paper certifying his
ability to do the work of a trade, naming him a journey-
man. Then, as he became a meml&gt;er of the guild, he
was privileged to practice the trade anywhere.
This system of apprenticeship continued for several
hundred years until public education began to assume
some of the duties of training men for industry. Be-
ginning at that time a definite distinction is drawn
between the two phases of apprenticeship, education
and vocational training. Today the word apprentice-
ship has lost much of its signifi-
cance because of this separation
of its functions. Education
through grammar school is now
compulsory and a high school
education is almost indispensable.
After graduation from high
school many boys enter trade
schools and a few continue their
education in the universities. The
engineering college of today is
really an apprentice school for in-
dustry quite as much as the trade
school is, but it trains men for
the higher professional jobs rath-
er than the trades. Whereas vocational training qualifies
men for jobs where skillful hands are required, the
college education develops the mind and equips men
with powers of observation and analysis, tools of no
small importance. It is the fact that this training,
formerly part of true apprenticeship, has now I&gt;ecome
a specialty, which marks the distinction between ap-
prenticeship as education and as vocational training.

Polariscope Straining Frame
Photoelasticity Applied to
Engineering Problems
By E. E. Weibel, Graduate Student
DURING the last few years there have appeared
in the technical journals a number of articles
in which the distribution of stress in structural
members or machine parts has been shown by color or
black and white fringe photographs. These photographs
were obtained by making use of the photoelastic proper-
ty of certain transparent materials such as glass, cellu-
loid, bakelite or phenolite.
It is of interest that although Brewster, the discoverer
of the property, foresaw as early as 1816 its application
to the problems of complex engineering structures such
as arches, it was not until 1913 that a successful, com-
prehensive application of the method to an arch prob-
lem was made and reported upon. This work was done
by Mesnager, who constructed a glass model of a span.
The results of his- work provided an independent check
of the engineers' calculations, which had been in some
doubt.
Between the above dates considerable experimental
and theoretical work on the photoelastic effect had
been done by physicists but the earlier work was hin-
dered to some extent by the fact that the Theory of
Elasticity was still in its infancy. The method has
gradually been rmding a place in the field of engineer-
ing and today many universities have photoelastic equip-
ment in their engineering laboratories and a number
of industrial concerns use it regularly as an aid in the
design of machine parts. In recently reported work
the method has been used to determine stresses in a
variety of problems, some of which are: the frame of
a dirigible, the steel sides of a railway coach, gear teeth,
leaf springs, punch press frames, co'umn footings,
and riveted joints.
Modern photoelastic equipment of a type suitable
for accurate engineering work was installed in 1930 in
the laboratory of the Engineering Mechanics Depart-
ment at the University of Michigan. It is available to
graduate students in the department for work on
research problems. Two papers based on photoelastic
work done in this laboratory by a former student, M.
M. Frocht, have appeared recently in the Transactions
of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
Description of Equipment
The equipment necessary to make a complete photo-
elastic study of a stress problem is of a very simple
nature. The source of light is an arc lamp or a mer-
cury vapor lamp, depending upon whether color or
black and white photographs are desired. A Nicol's
prism, called the polarizer, converts the light from the
source into plane polarized light. The loading frame
applies the loads to the model and holds it in the path
of the beam of polarized light. (The beams shown
here are supported outside of the picture and the load-
ing points about which stresses are concentrated can be
seen on the upper surface.) Another Nicol's prism
called the analyzer serves to bring about interference
effects to be mentioned later. Lastly, an image of the

model is brought to a focus on a screen or a photo-
graphic plate. Two "quarter-wave" plates and a few
minor parts complete the necessary equipment.
The Photoelastic Effect
For the purposes of this discussion a light ray may
be considered as a wave which is propagated as a trans-
verse vibration in an elastic medium. Such a ray will
pass through a transparent isotropic solid unchanged
except for a slight retardation due to the slower veloc-
ity through the solid. However, when a transparent
material which shows the photoelastic effect is stressed,
the light ray is not unchanged but is broken up into
two component rays having planes of vibration along
the principle stress directions. These two rays have
different velocities in the stressed material, the dif-
ference of velocity being proportional to the difference
of principal stresses in the material. As a result of the
difference of velocity, one of the rays, on emerging
from the material, is retarded relative to the other ray.
This relative retardation is a measure of the stress, and

this article, for all work and research described
was done in our own Engineering Mechanics
Laboratory. The "Polariscope" illustrated at the
top of this page is also in our "lab" and all pic-
tures were taken here. The cuts, including the
cover cut, are furnished through the courtesy of
"Mechanical Engineering".
I&gt;y causing the two rays to interfere (supposing the
mercury lamp to be used) a pattern of alternately dark
and bright fringes is made to appear on the image of
the stressed member. The apparatus is so arranged
that a relative retardation of an integral number of
wavelengths of green light causes a dark fringe, and a
relative retardation of an integral number plus one-
half wavelengths causes a bright fringe. With bakelite
and phenolite, which are optically very sensitive, as
many as thirty wavelengths difference may be observed.
The dark fringe corresponding to this would be called
the thirtieth order fringe. It is necessary to be sure
of the order of each fringe before a photograph is
taken. Hence the formation of fringes must be ob-
served from the beginning of loading. Moving pic-
tures have been used to provide a record of fringe
formation.
The stress at any fringe is proportional to its order.
The stress value of the first order fringe is found from
a pure bending test on a straight rectangular beam of
the same material and same thickness as the model.
A series of equidistant parallel fringes is produced by
this type of loading and a comparison of these with
the stress calculated by means of the simple beam
theory yields the required fringe value in pounds per
square inch.
The Stress Problem
The method is limited practically to the solution of
two-dimensional stress problems. Models are usually
about one-quarter inch thick and the beam of light is
passed through them normal to the surface. In ele-
mentary courses in strength of materials the two-
dimensional stress problem is shown to be completely
solved when the values and directions of the two princi-
pal stresses at all points in a stressed member are
known.
The required directions are readily obtained due to
the fact that a dark spot appears at all points for which
the direction of principal stress coincides with the di-
rection of the plane of polarization of the beam of light.
When the plane of polarization is fixed at a known angle
these dark spots form a continuous dark band known
as an isoclinic, which can be traced. Other isoclinics
are obtained by setting the prisms at other known
angles.
The values of the principal stresses which are gen-
erally referred to as P and Q respectively are not ob-
tained directly. As previously stated the fringe photo-
graph gives only the difference of' these stresses
(P—Q). Since the maximum shearing stress is
(P—Q)/2 the fringe may be considered as a picture
of the maximum shearing stresses. In order to get a
complete solution P and Q must be determined sepa-
rately.
Determination of P and Q
\ number of methods have been developed for ob-
taining the principal stresses separately. An extremely
sensitive lateral extensometer devised by Coker mea-
sures the variation of thickness of the model which is
a measure of the sum of the principal stresses, (P+Q).
Then knowing (P—Q) and (P+Q) at many points,
the two unknowns P and Q can be calculated. A
reasonable degree of accuracy in the results requires
that variations of the order of one-millionth of an inch
be detected.
Filon has described a graphical integration method
which makes use of the fact that at a boundary which
is free from forces the normal stress (say Q) is zero.
Hence at a boundary P can be found from the fringe
photograph. Values of P at interior points can l&gt;e
found by integrating along lines of principal stress,
starting with the known value at the boundary.
Aecuracy and Applicability of Results
Results obtained by the photoelastic method have
been compared with results of the exact mathematical
theory of elasticity for a large number of problems.
In general the agreement is surprisingly close. Experi-
enced investigators report errors of less than one per
cent in many instances.
The question is often asked to what extent the
results obtained for these transparent models may be
applied to structural materials such as steel. The an-
swer is that within the elastic limit they may be applied
exactly. Providing the models are not stressed beyond
their elastic limit the results obtained are true for any

The Chancery Courts
By Professor Walter C. Sadler
One of
the Law
Club Arches
THE law may be classified in a number of related
subjects, but the two main jurisdictions are "com-
mon law" and "equity". The former is usually
spoken of as the law, while the latter is called equity
or chancery jurisdiction. The law is distinctly older,
and its inherent defects gave rise to the equity courts.
In the early days of the law. legal actions were de-
veloped along certain lines, the plaintiff applying for
relief by means of a specific writ. These writs were
extremely formal and technical. If the litigant could
not find a proper writ to suit his circumstances he
would be without a remedy. Again, the courts of law
could grant money damages only. The strict severity
of the law courts led to much injustice and the only
remaining remedy obtainable was to petition the King
for mercy. As time went on thesee petitions for the
King's mercy multiplied until they becan&gt;e the main
activity of the King's chancellor. This great conges-
tion of work in the chancellor's court quickly empha-
sized the necessity for a uniform set of rules of
procedure. These rules were always kept liberal and
free of technicalities and were designed merely to
standardize the court activities.
The necessity for equity is brought out by the court
in Dalton vs Vanderveen, 29 N.Y.S. 342 where it was
said,
"The common-law courts paid such deference to forms
and precedents that they became slaves to them. Their
jurisdiction was thus circumscribed. They adhered to
certain precise writs and rigid forms of action which
were not sufficiently comprehensive to enable them to
give ******* any redress. In such case the ag-
grieved person was remediless, except he could get a
hearing of the King himeslf."
The system was well summarized in Shenehon vs Illi-
nois L. Ins. Co.. 100 111. A. 281. 288. where the court
said,
"The office of chancellor has been established before
the Norman conquest * * * As the representative of
the King, he exercised grace, tempered the strict rules
of law by considerations of equity, absolved suitors
from engagements into which they had been induced
to enter by fraud, accident or mistake, and gave reme-
dies for which the courts of the common law were,
owing to the fixed nature of their proceedings, inade-
quate,"
The rapid growth of equity jurisdiction caused some
concern on the part of the Judges of the law courts.
Their jealousy led to the understanding that the courts
of equity would take jurisdiction only when the "rem-
edy at law was inadequate".
Some of the early cases of equity jurisdiction arose
under the "unique chattel theory". In general, one
chattel is like another, and a court decree for damages
would place the owner in Status Quo, for he could buy
a duplicate with his money damages. There are some
exceptions, where the chattel is unique. Thus, in a
breach of contract for the purchase of a particular
heirloom, such as an ancient tobacco box or picture
album, which could not be replaced, a court of equity
would take jurisdiction on the basis of the inadequacy
of the remedy at law. The court of equity would grant
specific performance, that is, the possessor would have
to deliver up the particular chattel to the purchaser.
The case of unique chattels has a definite application
to engineering. A contract might be signed for a large
order of patented gears to be used in the manufacture
of automobiles. These articles are protected by the
patents and are the only ones of their kind on the
market. A refusal, therefore, to deliver as per contract
might stop the production of the automobile factory.
Money damages would not be adequate as that would
not open the factory. Therefore, a court of equity will
take jurisdiction and order specific performance.
A breached contract for the conveyance of land pre-
sents a somewhat similar case. Land is considered
unique, and no particular tract of land is identical with
any other. The court of law can give only money dam-
ages which would not be satisfactory, even if the plain-
tiff could buy a better tract with the money received.
So a court of equity will accept jurisdiction based upon
the inadequacy of the remedy at law, and grant specific
performance of the contract. In other words, the seller
must convey the particular tract of land as he agreed
to do in his contract.
Suits for fraud, accident or mistake may be brought
by an aggrieved party in equity because of his failure
to receive justice at law. This remedy seems reason-
able, but there has been an effort to stretch its applica-
tion. For instance, in Walker vs Kretsinger. 4 111. 502.
the facts were brought out that Walker and Cutting
were partners in the fuel business, that Cutting had
made a verbal contract with some dock owners for the
storage of coal. Later the dock owners tried to collect

Change
This issue of The Technic efuce more marks the be-
ginning effort of a new staff. A whole year has rolled
by and the Publication Board and Staff which took of-
fice seemingly such a short time ago, have passed on.
A new crew is at the helm, wondering what the future
holds for them.
The Publication Board, which so recently was added
to the list of ex's, was unique in several ways. Possibly
their biggest contribution was the framing of a new
constitution, embodying rigid rules which staff mem-
bers must follow. All methods and policies of the maga-
zine are clearly outlined, and the haphazard conducting
of The Technic is a thing of the past. The constitu-
tion became official with the signatures of the Advisory
Hoard and Dean Sadler.
It was also this Board which had the privilege of
producing the Fiftieth Anniversary of this magazine,
the oldest of its type in the country, and also the oldest
publication on this campus.
The makeup of the magazine and its contents con-
tinued on much the same basis, and was of a uniform
high grade. A new department was formed, "Notes
of the Profession," and it has received considerable
praiseworthy comment. A new humor column was
born. Stresses and Strains, which attempts to present
a longer, connected type of fun, rather than the clipped
joke.
The new blood in the Publication Board will try to
inject changes into the magazine and hope that with
the aid of an excellent staff and a good crop of tryouts,
these changes will be for the best and will approximate
in some degree, the accomplishments of the past Board.
The Slide Rule Danced
For some people the ghost walks, for others the
witches fly, but for the Engineers the Slide Rule
Dances. This year it danced at the Union on the night
of March 31, to the tune of Bobby Woodruff and his
orchestra. What is even more strange, it danced for
the meager sum of $1.50.
Wishing to make the dance an exclusive party for the
Engineering and Architectural Colleges, and keep it
within the price range of most students, it was decided
to lower the price of tickets. The response of the two
colleges was immediate, and all tickets were sold only
two days after they had been placed on sale. The
campus seems to like low priced dances, as the Slip
Stick Trot was the second one of that kind showing a
phenomenal success. Why not be sensible and keep
future dance prices down on the same plane?
But to get back to the dance itself. Three hundred
couples were present when Dick Cogger led his lady
fair in the grand march. Heads of all the various en-
gineering departments, and campus dignitaries made up
the list of patrons. Decorations included, besides the
gigantic Slide Rule and Technic seal, eight large panels
representing the various branches of engineering. Their
modernistic appeal was wonderful, and even if no one
could read their titles, a good time was had by all in
trying to decipher them. Betty Jane Wolf, chief deco-
ration and featured soloist of the orchestra, made a big
hit, and already it is rumored that the enrollment of
the Engineering College is falling off. The Irays are
taking up music!
But to again get serious—let's learn our lesson from
this dance and keep ticket prices on a sane basis. A
good time is all that one asks of a dance, no matter
what the price, and everyone surely had a good time
on the last night of March, 1933.
The Engineering College Magazine
An Engineering magazine has a definite place in an
Engineering College. It may, and should be. as much a
part of the Engineer's interests as his Calculus, his
Mechanical Lab., his Thermodynamics. It serves at
once as an outside, an extra-curricular interest to all
students of Engineering. The Engineering College Mag-
azine is an ideal exchange for information not only
among the various branches of engineering but also
among the different technical colleges.
The whole structure of Engineering is so immense, so
diffused, so extensive in its numberless branches, sub-
branches, and ramifications, that no one can hope more
than to become only slightly acquainted with it. The
very bulk of the Science of Engineering confines even
the most capable of men to but a small fragment of the
whole vast pattern. The most versatile are but special-
ists. The Engineer, however, in addition to a working
knowledge of his own particular branch, should possess
at least a superficial conception of the more important
divisions of the entire science. This he could never
acquire from text-books. The process of accumulation
would be hopelessly slow, probably ineffective, and
most certainly unpleasant. There is a definite need for
an exchange for information of a more or less general
nature among the various Engineers. This need the
Engineering College Magazine satisfies.
The Engineering College Magazine is invaluable as
a bond between the Alumni and the student body and
as the voice of student opinion. It is indispensable to
the fully equipped College of Engineering. C.A.D.

Notes of the Profession
Control tower on
roof of administration
building at Alle-
gheny County
Airport, Pittsburgh
Traffic Control at Allegheny Airport
The lighting and traffic control of the Allegheny
County Airport, Pittsburgh, embodies the best in en-
gineering practice making landing as safe at night as
at noon. It makes dispatching effective and quick and
at the same time enhances the appearance of the field.
Floodlighting accentuates the architectural beauty of
the administration building which in itself attracts
much attention from the air passengers.
The dispatching station is located in the control tower
atop the administration building. The handling of con-
tinuous traffic necessitates this centrally located control
where the operator may direct traffic and outline the
airport for incoming planes, thereby promoting safety
and helping the aviator. With this centralized control,
all lighting equipment on the field is directed by the
dispatcher in the observation room.
A control desk is equipped with a complete outline
of the field with pilot lamps marking the beacons,
markers, and signal lamps. A compass and wind indi-
cator also aids the operator in directing planes. The
circuits are so arranged that each landing direction is
indicated automatically by the rows of lights on each
side of the runway.
When the wind velocity falls below a certain value
the South to North runway lights are turned on until
the critical velocity is again reached.
The Radio City Music Hall
The 6200 persons who attended the opening of the
Radio City Music Hall in New York City last Decem-
ber were probably quite unaware of the combined efforts
of the civil, mechanical, electrical, and acoustical engi-
neers required to make the theater a reality. The prob-
lem of constructing and equipping the largest playhouse
in the world was attended by large problems not met in
the routine work of engineering design and construc-
tion.
In order that every member of the audience may see
and hear the artists on the huge stage, it has been neces-
sary to eliminate the use of supporting pillars. This
complicates the structural design to a great extent, es-
pecially when the large required floor area is considered.
It is also necessary in the design to take into account the
requirements of the lighting and acoustical engineers,
whose work is quite as important.
The acoustical engineers have also done a very com-
plete job; they have installed the most complete system
of sound reproduction and amplification ever designed
for a theater. Seat phones have been provided for
the hard of hearing. Specially built button-controlled
film phonographs in a sound projection booth in the
rear enable the stage director to produce thunder, wind,
and other effects. And, of course, a great deal of at-
tention had to be paid to the design of the stage, side
walls, and ceiling so that actors and musicians might
be heard all over the vast auditorium.
The amount of lighting equipment is enormous. It
includes four motor-operated light bridges 104 feet long,
four portable light towers, with a capacity of 25 spot
and arc lights each, as well as other spot and arc lights
in the wings. There is no central chandelier in the
theater, but light is obtained from lamps of various
colors concealed in the overlapping arches which cover
the ceiling and side walls.
The mechanical equipment for lowering and raising
the stages is interesting. The stage, 144 feet wide by
80 feet deep, is moved up and down through a vertical
distance of 40 feet by three stage elevators, each 70
by 16 feet. Hydraulic power is used in the elevators.
There is also a turntable set in the surface if each ele-
vator, 47 feet in diameter, which serves to allow even
greater flexibility of arrangement.
Combined with the work of the engineers has been
that of the architects who have elaborately designed and
decorated the edifice in extremely modern fashion.
These men have cooperated to give us the greatest
theater ever built.
Rubberizing the Railroads
A widespread development of the rubber-tired rail
coach seems imminent during the next few years, be-
cause of the many distinct advantages which it is cap-
able of offering to transportation by rail, and especially
because the railroads are on the lookout for anything
which will reduce operating expenses and give more
convenient service. Up till now the railroads have
done little to reduce the dead car weight per passenger
of the coaches, because they felt that this would not
reduce expenses enough to make up for the deflection
of passenger traffic to other forms, such as the bus or
the airplane.

tion has been carried on in trying to produce a solid
rubber tire to carry the load, but it is now generally
realized that the pneumatic rail tire is the only solution.
The bearing capacity of solid rubber is slight compared
to that of metal, so that the only way to increase the
load-carrying capacity of the tire is to increase the
contact area. This the solid tire is not flexible enough
to do. Even with the pneumatic tire a great deal of
research has been necessary to produce something
practical, for there are many problems to be solved.
The problem of getting sufficient load-carrying cap-
acity for a given width of rail head remains. It is
necessary to take account of possible blow-outs or
punctures, and of "hunting", that is, swaying from side
to side along the track. Furthermore, the fact that rub-
ber is an electric insulator introduces complications
into the design of electric signalling devices. On the
other hand, the greater adhesiveness of rubber on steel
and the smoothness of the rails helps to simplify the
problem.
These problems can be solved in various ways, by
different designs of the tires. In all designs, lightness
of car weight is a paramount feature, not only because
it is necessary for satisfactory operation of the tires,
but because it reduces installation and operating costs
and increases operating speeds. In one tire, an alumi-
num safety ring is used inside the rubber carcass of the
tire. This extends downward to within half an inch of
the inner side of the bottom part of the tire carcass.
Thus, in the case of a blow-out, the
tire deflates until the safety ring is
resting firmly on the rubber and thus
indirectly on the rail head. Elec-
trical contact with the rail for sig-
nalling is established through wire-
brush blocks which are mounted
between the wheels on both sides of
the car.
In another system, called the Air
Suspension system, the pneumatic
tires support the load of the vehicle
and transmit the propelling force to
steel tires which entirely surround
them and which are in direct con-
tact with the rails. This allows the
pneumatic tires to take all shocks
and deflections while the steel outer
tires bear the load and allow it to
be distributed over a comparatively
large area of the rubber tire.
These advantages of faster and
quieter operation. reduced operating
cost, and greater travelling comfort
may in the near future be expected
to furnish the railroads with an effective means of
regaining and retaining their once considerable passen-
ger traffic.
o
A Significant Diesel Installation
The recent installation and operation experience of
a 1080 horsepower automatically-operated Diesel plant
by the Number One Park' Avenue Building, New
York City, is held by many building owners, architects,
and engineers as being of the utmost significance. Rec-
ords indicate that the operating costs of the Diesel
plant as designed are so much below the cost of pur-
chased power, that the investment can be written off in
five or six years, the Diesel plant thereafter saving
over half the previous yearly electrical bill. A Diesel
plant installed in a building can thus under certain con-
ditions allow a great saving in the cost of electrical
energy. This particular example may represent the
beginning of a trend of large power consumers away
from power produced at a central station.
The New York installation (which is entirely auto-
matic) consists basically of four 270 horsepower engines
direct-connected to direct-current generators, a switch-
board, a storage battery, and a motor-generator booster.
The switchboard is provided with electrical devices
which automatically start and stop one or more of the
engines, so that the engines kept running will have a
capacity equal to 25 per cent more than the existing

Dear Alumnus,
It doesn't seem so long since we met last time but
we are all set to tell what's what and where. It's

but anyway, you and I are here and some faith-

We start off with a note concerning John D. Hib-
bard. From the time of graduation until 1924, Mr.
Hibbard was engaged in the manufacturing busi-
ness in Chicago, and during this time, became an
executive officer of the National Metal Trades Asso-
ciation. He was also President of the U. of M. club
of Chicago, and after moving to Hollywood, became
an active member of the Los Angeles club. During
his sojourn through school, he spent four years on
the baseball team of which he was captain in his
freshman year. And just in case you don't know,
he was a member of Dean Cooler's first class.
1895
Mr. James H. Dunbar, who is at present residing
at 2849 Fairfax road, Cleveland, is engaged in the
services of the Grasselli Chemical Co., of Cleveland,
Ohio.
1899
Mr. John T. Mountain is next on our roll. We
learn that he is at present employed by the Common-
wealth Edison Co., Chicago. His home address is
375 Palos road, Glencoe, Illinois.
Of this same class is Mr. William L. Cooper of
the Mechanical dep't. However, his present occu-
pation is somewhat different. As American Com-
mercial Attache for the Bureau of Foreign and Do-
mestic Commerce, Dep't. of Commerce, Washington,
D.C., he is now situated at Bush House, Aldwych,
London, W.C. 2, England.
1902
And here's a note in the interest of Mr. Warren
N. Vandersluis, residing at Bruce Avenue, Floss-
moor, Illinois. He is employed as an Electrical En-
gineer with the Chicago Terminal Improvement of
the Illinois Central Railroad.
1904
A note from the Westinghouse Supply Company
informs us that Mr. B. W. Clark has been appointed
General Manager of this concern which the West-
inghouse Commercial Investment Co. owns. After
a varied experience in the Radio Department of the
Robertson-Cateract Co., and as General Manager of
the Gould Storage Battery Co., and later of the
Gillespie Eden Corporation, he came to the West-
inghouse Commercial Investment Company as a
special agent. He became Vice-president and later
General Manager of that company.
1909
Mr. Francis C. Mills, Jr., now acts in the official
capacity of President and Treasurer of the Mills
Company, Cleveland, Ohio. In connection with his
business, Mr. Mills has designed the well known

We Feature--
John H, Nead, 'O9E

AMONG the many and varied fields of engineering
there is none more fascinating than that of
Metallurgical engineering. Besides requiring
a thorough knowledge of principles, it also demands
unusual ingenuity. With this in view, it is with extreme
pleasure that we call to your memory Mr. John H.
Nead, '09E, and believe you us, there is nothing that
we would rather do than to wander around with our
Alumni in practice.
After passing, one by one. the milestones of a very
ordinary but very industrious youth, he entered the
University of Michigan and began a career destined to
be far reaching in its scope. In 1909 he was graduated as a
Ch.E., and after leaving behind his happy student days,
he stepped into the field of practice. For the next nine
years, he was connected with various concerns and
received vast experience which proved invaluable later
on. Between 1918 and 1919 he was Captain of the
Engineering Division of the Ordnance Dep't., A.E.F.
In this capacity he spent several months overseas, thus
giving him an opportunity to acquire a thorough knowl-
edge of the French steel works operations and metal-
lurgical processes. Soon after his discharge he became
affiliated with the American Rolling Company as Chief
Metallurgist and immediately began to make himself
known by that familiar method of industrious and in-
telligent work. Attracted by his ability and numerous
successes, the Inland Steel Company obtained his ser-
vices on April 1st, 1931, and in this new capacity of
Chief Metallurgical Engineer, he will have full direction
of his company's metallurgical, chemical, and research
activities. His entire progress has been marked with
phenomenal success and at present his ability is recog-
nized both here and abroad as can well be seen by his
numerous connections with professional societies. You
will probably remember that Mr. Nead is past presi-
dent of the American Institute of Mining and Metal-
lurgical Engineers. But his scope of ability does not
cease here. We find that he is author of many patents
and numerous technical papers of note.
And here's a little personal information. In 1913, he
was married to Miss Martha Ohnstrant of Syracuse,
and he now is the father of a nine year old daughter.
With these last lines we leave him to your thought
knowing that his future accomplishments will speak
for themselves.

MP
Tau Beta fi Initiates
The evening of March 28 was a most important one
in the careers of sixteen embryo engineers, for they
were given one of the highest honors the Engineering
College can bestow on its students, the good fellowship
and key of Tau Beta Pi. Chosen from the upper eighth
of their classes in scholastic standing, plus a require-
ment of exemplary character and activity, six Seniors
and ten Juniors were formally initiated at the Union.
At the banquet that immediately followed the initia-
tion, Professor A. D. Moore, that dean of toastmasters,
was in his usual position. After a welcome by E. E.
Boynton, '33E, and a response by F. S. Kohl, '33E, for
the initiates, Dr. Benjamin F. Bailey, Head of the Elec-
trical Engineering Department, gave the principal talk
of the evening. He chose for his subject the engineering
and inventive exploits of Benjamin Franklin and it
proved to be especially interesting. Both of the Bens,
Franklin and Bailey, are models of resourcefulness.
Professor Edward A. Stalker, Head of the Depart-
ment of Aeronautical Engineering, was also initiated
at the same time. The undergraduates initiated were as
follows: James A. Adkinson, '33E; Maurice E. Bates,
'34E; Ernest F. Brater, '34E; Robert A. Choate, '34E;
Stanley C. Killian, '34E; Frederick S. Kohl, '34E;
Benjamin Labaree, '33E; George F. Leland, '33E;
Chapin M. Lowell, '34E; Clair A. Marshall. '34E;
Walter H. Powers, '34E; John C. Seeley, '34E; D. G.
Sheperd, '34E; Stanley W. Smith, '34E; Eugene W.
Wasielewski, '33E, and Leon V. Whipple, '33E.
Tuxedos are in order for the basic course members
and campus students who attend. The dance is not a
closed affair, and it has always been supported by stu-
dents not in the R.O.T.C.
1933 Military Ball
On April twenty-eighth, at the Michigan Union, the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps of the University will
stage the Military Ball. This event, an annual affair,
is the highlight of the social season for the R.O.T.C.,
as well as the local military groups. The committee in
charge this year is headed by Don Knight, '33E, who
promises to outdo his predecessors. Carl Moore's orches-
tra from Chicago has been selected to furnish the music.
Always well attended, a large crowd is expected this
year. Already over one hundred of the advanced course
men have signified their intention of being present.
Xo other campus dance is more colorful. In a set-
ting of flags and bunting, with machine guns and trench
mortars at strategic points about the floor, the hall is
an appropriate setting. Here they dance, in their khaki
uniforms, boots and belts polished, buttons shined,
spurs clicking, these embryo officers and guests. The final
touch of color is added by the ladies, without whom
no ball could take place.
A.S.M.E.
About thirty-five students attended the last meeting
of the A.S.M.E. student branch at the Michigan Union
on Wednesday, March 22.
President Paul Hartig opened the meeting with rou-
tine business. Elgin O. Marshall, '33E, was selected
by the group as delegate to the Chicago conference
of student sections, to take place on April 28 and 29,
for which he is preparing a paper on "Pneumatic Con-
veyers".
Prof. R. L. Hawley explained the plan of the A.S.M.E.
to take students as student members instead of as mem-
bers of student branches. Because of the higher dues.
he expects the Michigan group to operate with both
types of members next year, as Sophomores and Jun-
iors do not usually care to take out full membership.
Plans were made for the appointment of a nomi-
nating committee by the president, and the election of
officers to be held April 4.
After viewing a motion picture of the large Phila-
delphia power development, "Conowingo", the meeting
was adjourned for refreshments.
Vanishing Traditions
This year has seen the passing of many well-
established traditions. Early in the year the fact dawned
on us that the old custom of freshman pots has fallen
by the wayside. Only a few pots could be counted on
the campus and so finally even the Student Council gave
up its foolish hope that freshmen could be forced to
wear pots. Thus pot wearing passed to its death.
Next was the dismal failure of the Fall Games. A few
freshmen and fewer sophomores were all who put in
an appearance. So, in spite of all talk, another custom
passed quietly to its death.
And now we look to another tradition. Junior Jack-
ets,—will that too, join the ranks of the "Vanished
Traditions"? Lately the campaign to sell the jackets
has started and on all sides we see the efforts of the
committee in charge. After reading the notices of the
committee we wonder what success they will have.
"Old Man Depression" still holds his power and makes
money hard to get. Yet, it is too bad to see the jacket
tradition become dusty. It has served a long and useful
life and does not deserve to die. R.E.M.

It takes resourcefulness...
Time and again, Bell System engineers have
demonstrated their pioneering bent in working
out unusual telephone construction problems.
For example, they laid a huge conduit under
the Harlem River. They dredged a trench in the
river bottom, lowered enormous sections of iron
pipe, sent down divers to join the sections, en-
cased the finished tube in concrete. Through
this they ran telephone cables forming one of
New York's main lines of communication. Across
the Gila River in Arizona they constructed a
catenary span 2373 feet long. To bridge oceans,
they developed radio telephony. They have built
telephone lines over mountains, across deserts,
through swamps.
Their resourcefulness in getting through, over
or under natural barriers makes possible telephone
service that is practically world wide in reach.

STUDENT EATS NUTS AND THEN BOLTS
He shuffles into class almost ten minutes late every
day and creates an unnecessary noise by slamming the

up and calling them by name, and sometimes he has
been known to talk aloud in the very midst of the class.
No wonder students eat nuts. It's our professor.

MORE JOLTS
It has been discovered that a certain co-ed on this
campus has given up lipstick and rouge and has let the
boy friend keep the compact. She has thrown away her
flask (I doubt it) and has cut down to half a pack of
cigarettes a day. She spends all her evenings listening
to the radio and is in bed before ten. She has thrown
over a young football star for a Tau Beta Pi boy with
horn-rimmed glasses and shiny pants. She has dis-
continued reading Balzac and is now reading "The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."
This is the ideal rumor that has been circulated
around the campus for the last few weeks. Stresses
and Strains wishes to spike all such rumors. We have
done our utmost to find such a person but to no avail.
Many co-eds may appear as such but don't let them

Effects of Education on Industry
In striking parallel to the increasing stress placed
on educational training during the last seventy-five
years is the remarkable technical progress which the
same period has seen in industry. That apprentice
education has made this progress possible is undeniable
in the face of such parallel growth. Not only by hast-
ening technological improvement in industry, but also
by strengthening the loyalty and morale of employees
has education encouraged the vast improvement during
this period.
The rapid rise in technological methods during the
last fifty to seventy-five years is attributable to the
displacement of rule of thumb methods by scientific
analysis. It is in the furtherance of this phase of
development that education has contributed most to
the rise of industry. By developing the mind as an
analytical tool and by giving it the l&gt;enefit of experi-
ence, education turns the active ambitions of youth to
practical purpose.
A few examples of mechanical progress will serve
to indicate the extent of this contribution. The de-
velopment of the steam turbine is an excellent example
of the effect of education. The idea of using the force
of a steam jet to produce rotation was known as early
as 150 B.C. but it lay dormant for 2000 years until Dr.
Gustaf deLaval and Charles A. Parsons began inde-
pendently to develop it in 1880. Their scientific attack
on the problem soon brought results. Delaval produced
a single-stage turbine which was commercially success-
ful in small sizes and Parsons built the first multi-stage
unit, which was the forerunner of the modern large
turbine. But, like all inventions, neither of these types
was immediately successful. It remained for others,
many others, to solve the difficult problems of design
and construction which were required to make the
turbine what it is today. Only by educating many men
in the fundamental theories underlying its operation
and by providing them with the knowledge of previous
experience was any such progress possible.
Effects of Vacationed Training on Industry
A recognition of the fact that vocational training is
one kind of apprenticeship suggests that its effects
upon industry may be quite different from those of
educational apprenticeship which have just been con-
sidered. Vocational training, though it falls short of
true apprenticeship, is justified by the better workmen
it provides and by its help in placing men in the jobs
for which they are best suited.
Many jobs in modern industry are highly specialized
and therefore limited in scope. The training for such
jobs neeed not, to fulfill this purpose, do more than
prepare men to do one kind of work well. The mechan-
ic is no longer called upon to be also a designer, the
carpenter an architect. If he knows how to execute

Where body
stamina counts
In the long grind, it's the athlete with the stamina
who lasts.
So, too, with a Jenkins Valve. It's the body stamina
that counts, that keeps the valve in the line, un-
affected by the strains of pipe weight and settling,
lifting,expansion,contraction or frequent operation.
Jenkins bronze valves are cast of virgin metal;
Jenkins iron body valves of a high quality, close-
grained mixture. Metals are analyses-controlled by
Jenkins metallurgists. Skillful design is provided
to make possible an even distribution of metal
throughout the valve body.
Jenkins Valves are made in bronze and iron, in
standard, medium and extra heavy pattern—a
valve for practically every valve need.

the plans of the designer, the craftsman needs no other
qualifications. It is this function which vocational
training assumes today.
In the trade school or technical high school men are
trained to use their heads as well as their hands. Most
such schools review or teach the rudiments of mathe-
matics and its application to a particular trade. Men
learn how to read and interpret mechanical drawings
and specifications, how to lay out work for the greatest
speed and accuracy. They are taught to think before
they act. Industry benefits from the more intelligent
planning and greater output which results from such
training.
Vocational schools perform a very real service for
industry in helping men to find the work for which they
are best suited. This is especially true in the public
schools where conditions are such that the student is
given individual attention. Under proper guidance a
young man is likely to find his talents and to choose
the proper field in which to apply them.
This function of the vocational school is performed
by allowing the student considerable freedom in his
choice of courses. Were he to enter industry directly
he would be tied down to a particular job, whereas in
school he has considerable latitude. Should a young
man believe first that he should like to l&gt;e a carpenter
but after a time should discover that he is best equip-
ped to be a mechanic, he can make the change in school
without much loss. In industry, on the other hand,
prospects of better immediate wages might lead him
to enter a field for which he is ill fitted, and, once he
has gotten under way in a particular job. it is much
to his disadvantage to try to change.
The Effects of Both on Public Life
Although education and vocational training each
make a rather distinct contribution to industry, they
merge together in their effect on public life. By raising
the standards of Iving. by developing men's l&gt;est quali-
ties, and by making better citizens they make the com-
munity a better place in which to live.
The apprentice training of today, like the training of
a century and a half ago. tends to raise the standard
of living. But the way in which it has contributed to
this growth is somewhat obscure. Apprentices, as a
group, did not start out to improve living conditions or
working conditions, but the working out of an economic
principle concerned with wages and the standard of
living did cause their efforts to be reflected in this way.
Real wages, the amount of actual product for each
worker, are both a result and a cause of the standard
of living. The immediate wages are the result of labor
performed under the incentive of maintaining a certain
standard: but the standard of living of tomorrow is
determined by the wages of today. Apprenticeship, by
increasing the product of industry, increases the real
wages of labor. As the real wages of labor increase,
the standard of living is raised to a new level. Young

by the.r efforts raise the standard to an even higher
plane.
\outh still has ideals and modern education is plan-
ned to permit the greatest freedom for the working
out of these ideals in practice. In the modern educa-
tional scheme youth is under great stress, but from it
he emerges a stronger and surer man. His philosophy
is based on an appreciation of the world which preceded
him and a realization of the problems which will con-
front him in the world of industry.
Conclusion
This study of apprenticeship from the standpoint of
its effect on industry and public life has shown: that
education, as a distinct phase of apprenticeship, has
contributed to the betterment of industry both techno-
logically and in human relationships; that vocational
training has improved workers and helped to place
them properly; and, finally, that both kinds of training
add to the success of life in the community.
THE CHANCERY COURTS
(Continued from page 8)
a second time for storage but failed. They then sued at
law. Cutting, the partner who handled the details had
died, and Walker did not pay any attention to the
suit, making the mistake that his attorney knew all
of the facts. The judgment went against Walker, and
he now seeks an injunction against recovery of the
judgment against him. But the court says that Walker
has slept on his rights and is guilty of negligence and
laches. In other words a clear cut case of mistake can-
not be extended to include negligence.
Factories are often subject to injunction suits, due
to noise or smoke nuisances which they create. It is
not reasonable that a mill should so use its property as
to impair the neighbors enjoyment of their own proper-
ty. At first glance the problem appears simple, for
certainly money damages might be an entirely inade-
quate remedy for the injury suffered. But there are
cases where a court of equity will refuse an injunction.
Take the nuisance of arsenic fumes from a copper
smelter which will destroy vegetation on surrounding
property. On the other hand, the closing of a ten
million dollar smelter might very possibly cause a far
greater injury in the matter of unemployment. The
courts look with favor on a compromise solution.
Injunction against infringement of patent rights is
somewhat complex in application. For instance, sup-
pose that the complainant seeking the injunction has
merely a shadow of a claim for infringement. The
question arises, should a court of equity grant a tempo-
rary injunction pending the long litigation in the patent
courts, or would justice be better served by some other
system? An equitable solution is frequently secured by
requiring a bond of the manufacturer that he will keep
full records of all sales and profits, and stand ready to
pay the damages if he should lose the infringement

the courts may administer the case fairly and still not

It must be clear that the length of this discussion
does not permit even a thorough cursory review of
the subject of Equity. Certain branches have been en-
tirely omitted. It is quite evident, however, that the
field of equity bears an important part in the adminis-

are distinctly unique in their effectiveness.

material within the range of stress for which it obeys
Hooke's law of proportionality of stress to strain.
Mathematically this is shown to be true because the
two physical constants E and p., Young's Modulus and
Poisson's Ratio respectively, do not appear in the
differential equation, given above, from which the
stresses are determined.
The effect of stress concentration on the strength of
ductile materials in a fatigue test is not as severe as
the results of the photoelastic method and the exact
theory might indicate. But this cannot be used as a
criticism of the photoelastic method for as pointed out
its results do not apply beyond the limit of proportion-
ality of the material.
Now that the accuracy of the photoelastic method
has been established, it is a powerful tool for the solu-
tion of problems whose complexity would make a solu-
tion by means of the mathematical theory practically
impossible.
For the less rigorous demands of industry it is prac-
tical. Models can be made of new parts and by a cut
and try method the shape can be improved so as to use
metal in the most economical manner and at the same
time improve the stress conditions in the member. Very
often the stress due to sharp changes of section can be
found only by such a method.

load. The generators are 250 volt, three-wire, direct
current units with flat compound windings. The steel
tank for storing fuel oil has a capacity of 5000 gallons.
An important feature of the installation is the use
of circulating water for heating the regular hot-water
supply of the building. By this means, the cost of heat-
ing the water is halved.
The plant is an outstanding example of a well-
planned engineering project and during the first 60
days that the plant took over the building load, the
fuel and lubricating consumption were found to be
below the estimates.
Building owners can look for little relief from the
high cost of electricity during a depression. Reduced
central station load, acting through the phenomenon
of fixed charges, raises the cost of each unit of energy.

Artist's Conception of Boulder Dam on Completion


By Harold J. Toro, '33E
THE Boulder Canyon Project Act approved by
the President December 21, 1928 providing for
construction of a reservoir of not less than
70.000,000 acre-feet capacity on the Colorado River
is under construction.
The purposes served by the Act are: (1) Control-
ling floods, (2) improving navigation and regulat-
ing flow of Colorado River; (3) storing and deliver-
ing stored water for reclamation of public lands; (4)
generating electrical energy in order to make pro-
ject self-supporting.
Studies have been carried on by U. S. Reclama-
tion service on the Colorado River since 1904. In
the period from 1924 to 1928 approximately half a
million dollars were spent in foundation explora-
tions of Boulder and Black Canyons.
Discharges of the Colorado River have been re-
corded by the U. S. Geological Survey since 1902,
at Topock since 1918, at Grand Canyon since 1923.
Records of varying discharges since 1895 are on
record, and from this date estimates have been pre-
pared of flow of Colorado River at Boulder Canyon
for a 33-year period from 1897-1929 and with up-
stream development for years 1938-1988.
Silt Storage—The Colorado River Board adopted
137,000 acre-feet per annum as the rate of silt to
flow into the reservoir. It is estimated that the
total amount of silt deposits at the end of the 50
years will not be over 3,000,000 acre-feet, this is tak-
ing into consideration the silt deposited in other
dams built upstream.
The reservoir formed will be more than 100 miles
long and will be the largest artificial body of water
in the world.
Dam Site—the dam will be located in Black Can-
yon, 25 miles from Las Vegas, Nevada. The site
adopted is about \l/, miles from the canyon. The
rock formation is of volcanic origin, of the breccia
rocks. The rock is well cemented, tough, durable,
impervious and excellent material for tunneling and
for foundations and abutments of high dams. Un-
disturbed potholes, crossed by faults, exist on the
Arizona side about 900 feet above the river, thus
indicating no movement, along faults, during period
in which river channel was eroded 900 feet.
The Dam—The major items of the dam consist
of four 50-foot diversion tunnels (two of which will
be later used as spillways, conduits and two as pen-
stock tunnels.) A power house containing 16 units.
Four 30-foot diameter intake towers, four outlet
valve houses, located on canyon walls, two overflow
spillways, each 700 feet long and connected to diver-
sion tunnel by inclined shafts, 50 to 70 feet in dia-
meter. The dam is a concrete gravity reaction
structure, 770 feet high, 1180 feet long on the crest
and built in the form of an arch 500-foot radius on
the axis. Approximately 3,407,000 cubic yards of
concrete will be contained in the dam.
Methods of building—The Dam was designed
for a maximum stress of 30 tons per square foot, as
recommended by the Colorado River Board. The
stresses in the sections were determined by the
trial load method analysis, the Method developed
in the Denver office of the Bureau of Reclamation
in the past five years.
This method takes care of uplift at the base of
the dam, and within the concrete, radial of cantilever
element, temperature changes, transverse shear,
tangential shear, effect of twist and effect of foun-
dation and abutment deformation.
To provide for expansion and contraction the
concrete on the dam is to be built up in blocks or
columns about 50x50 feet in plan. The upstream
and downstream vertical faces of these blocks will
be curved on the alignment of dam. The other
faces will be parallel to the river channel up to ele-
vation of 800 feet (about 300 feet above the foun-
dation) radial above E. 1100 and warped between
800 and 1,100. Cobble stones up to 9 inches are being
used and the concrete is designed to give a stress
of 2,500 pounds per square inch at 28 davs.
Diversion of river during construction is being
taken care of by four concrete-lined circular tunnels,
50 feet in diameter, all on one level and about 4.000
feet long. The flow that can pass through these
tunnels is 200,000 second-feet. Below the dam is
the power house, a U-shaped structure with a wing
on each side of the canyon wall. Each wing will
house 8 power units. These wings are 500 feet

A Century of Progress
Chicago's 1933 World's Fair
The
Administration
Building
JUNE 1st, 1933, marks the date for the curtain
rise on the world's greatest exposition—A
Centurv of Progress—Chicago's 1933 World's
Fair. For over three years architects, design-
ers, engineers and construction men of all types
from various industrial organizations exhibiting at
the Fair have been busy laying out and erecting the
scenery for their part in the great show. June 1st
the gates will be officially opened, the work of these
builders will have been completed, and a good por-
tion of the estimated fifty million persons expected
to attend the Fair will see a magnificent array of
ultra-modernistically designed buildings, which
house the many exhibits signifying the development
of science and industry.
The Major Groups of Exhibits
The Applied Science and Industry Exhibits will
in general portray the application of scientific
achievements and discoveries in the industry. Un-
usual features of historic interest, processes of man-
ufacture, final products, and the effects of the
developments of industry on living conditions in
general are shown in these exhibits.
The Applied Science and Industry Exhibits are
divided and arranged in the following groups:
(1) The Travel and Transport group includes
exhibits of transportation by railroad, highway,
waterway, and air, together with exhibits by the as-
sociated and related industries, such as manufac-
turers of rail equipment and supplies, automotive
equipment, and marine supplies.
Within the great dome of the Travel and Trans-
port building the spectator may find the first auto-
mobile that ever was to operate on American
streets, and, as a contrast to this ancient "gas
chariot," may be found the more modern models of
cars, improved automobiles of much superior de-
sign and durability, automobiles improved largely
by Detroit's most able automotive engineers.
Another contrast—air transportation twenty-five
years ago and today. A small frail airplane of the
type used by the Wright brothers of Dayton may be
seen alongside the most perfect and speedy nutlti-

motored passenger plane. Close by the planes
stands a reproduction of the famous "Rocket,"
America's first practical locomotive.
In a large area to the south of the Travel and
Transport Building one may see the most modern,
air-conditioned railway cars and up-to-date loco-
motives.
The Travel and Transport groups will greatly
interest the transportation engineer and the auto-
mobile enthusiast.
(2) The Electrical group includes exhibits of the
manufacturer of electrical machines, the generator,
distribution and utiliziation of electrical power, the
applications of electricity in communication and
use of electricity in radio transmission.
The Electrical Building, in which the age of elec-
tricity is exemplified in many interesting exhibits
brought to the Fair by such firms as General Elec-
tric and Westinghouse, is one of the most impres-
sive structures on the exposition grounds. This great
semi-circular building, when illuminated at night,
presents a rare spectre of beauty with its colorful
reflection on the waters of the nearby lagoon.
Adjoining the Electrical Building is the Radio
and Communications Building, a rectangular struc-
ture rising over one hundred feet in the air. This
building, an impressive example of modern architec-
ture, houses the exhibits of communication by wire
and wireless. The Electrical group as a whole
affords an excellent educational display.
(3) The Agricultural group includes exhibits of
food products, farm machinery and equipment, dairy
products, and prize stock. The building housing
these exhibits is six hundred feet long, one hundred
feet wide and forty feet in height. This height af-
fords ample room for the exhibits of agricultural
products and machinery.
The main purpose of the Agricultural exhibits in
the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition is to por-
tray the story. of agricultural science and the rela-
tion of its achievements to the progress of living
conditions.
(4) The Medical and Chemical group embraces
exhibits from manufacturers which serve the medi-
cal profession and from the closely associated manu-
facturers of chemicals. These exhibits, with those
of the other basic sciences are to be shown in the
great Hall of Science, perhaps the most outstanding
building at the Fair. The spirit of scientific
achievement—the fundamental occasion for A Cen-

. Hall of Science.
(5) The General Exhibit group includes the ex-
hibits of the textile and mineral industries and in-
dustrial engineering, which are quartered in another
outstanding model of modernistic architecture, the
General Exhibits Building.
Comb-shaped in plan, with five pavilions, one
hundred and ten feet in width, four courts open-
ing toward the lagoon, the Exhibits group con-
nects with the Hall of Science by a double deck
arcade. Though very unique in its design, this
group has been produced at a remarkably low cost.
(6) While the above five groups provide a place
for the exhibits for any field of industry, the need
was felt for another group where the applications
of any industry in the home and municipality could
be more effectively portrayed, in conjunction with
the products of other industries. So a sixth group
was added and created, the Home and Industrial
Arts group. Such a building, to accommodate these
displays, showing new materials and methods of
construction, the genius of interior decorators and
home planners, the work of municipal and sanitary
engineers, is now being completed.
Truly these six groups represent a good portion
of the most interesting sections of the Fair, but by
no means all. A book could be written concerning
the other displays of private industries and the var-
ious foreign countries taking part in the Fair. A
good deal could be written about the exhibits at the
Federal and State Building. The spectacular dis-
plays of the General Motors Corp., the Chrysler
Corp., and the Firestone Rubber Company deserve
considerable mention, but we will leave all of these
exhibits for the personal inspection of the reader
on his visit to Chicago's 1933 World Exposition.
Artificial Illumination Plays a Prominent Role
at the Exposition
The application of the art of indirect and flood
lighting plays an important part in the general
scheme of exterior illumination of the buildings.
Glaring illumination effects have been discouraged
and have been largely replaced by the indirect ap-
plication of soft colored neon tubes and rotating
"spots" reflecting on the exterior walls with the aid
of aluminum reflectors. Naturally the main pur-
pose of the exterior illumination is to emphasize
the architectural treatment more effectively with
light and color.
Because most of the exhibits are housed in win-
dowless buildings, very little natural light is ad-
mitted. Hence, in order that interiors of buildings
and exhibits are lighted effectively, all natural light
is eliminated and, as a substitute, indirect lighting
is again applied at a constant intensity or at an
intensity that can be controlled as desired. Elec-
tricity as a lighting factor shows its usefulness to
mankind once again: in its early stage at the 1893
Columbian Exposition and now in its advanced
stage of development for the World's Fair.
Exposition Buildings are Quite Unique in
Form and Structure
The Exposition buildings, taken as a whole, are
not only ultra-moderistic in their architectural de-
sign, but they take these new forms with the appli-
cation of new construction practices. To fully
describe the construction methods applied in the
erection of the half-barrel vault of the Agricultural
Building or a detailed discussion of the air cooled
wall of the Travel and Transport Building is far
beyond the writer's power in this limited article.
However, there are features of construction that
we cannot overlook, namely the dome of the Travel
and Transport Building, which is held in suspension
one hundred and twenty-five feet above the ground
by cables attached to twelve tall towers. The reason
for adopting this suspension principle was not to
attract wide criticism from the architectural and
engineering professions, but purely because of the
necessity for a clear, unobstructed space without
pillars, in order to better show the exhibits. This
interesting dome is known as "the dome that
breathes" because the expansion and contraction of
the cables as the temperature varies causes the roof
to rise or sink as much as eighteen inches.
The material used in the construction of the
major buildings' exterior walls is sheets of a board
made of compressed cement and asbestos fibre com-

The slope of the bracing wires introduces end load into
the wing spars of this "Gee-Bee"
THE problem of the buckling of columns under
axial loads is familiar to all engineers after
their elementary courses in strength of mate-
rials. When lateral loading is added to axial load-
ing new conditions exist that are not as familiar to
most engineering students but which are of partic-
ular interest to the aeronautical and civil engineer.
After a review of some of the existing literature
which is used as a basis of judgment concerning
the critical loads of beams with combined axial and
lateral loading, several experiments were conducted
with model beams in order to verify the theory ad-
vanced by the literature and supplemented by the
writers.
In the first place critical loading must be dis-
tinguished from simple failure of the beam due to
exceeded fibre stresses. When the critical load is
reached the beam will have excessive and danger-
ous deflections or become elastically unstable. If
a beam were subjected to a lateral load and the
maximum fibre stresses were just about reached,
a very small axial load would obviously destroy the
beam but the required additional load would be
the maximum load and not the critical load. We
see that in many cases the critical load may be the
same without lateral load as with lateral load.
The first two problems considered, although they
include no lateral loading, illustrate some of the
traps which one is apt to fall into in determining
critical loads. The first problem is that of an ini-
tially curved bar. A flat steel strip was given an
appreciable reverse curvature in such a manner
that it contained no initial stresses tending to re-
turn it to a straight bar. For a straight bar of the
same length Euler's critical load, Pe, would equal

point of inflection at the middle one might suppose

ing that the buckling length to be considered was-^
for the bar. This is shown to be wrong however,
and the point of inflection has no effect. When the
bar is first loaded, the initial curvature does increase
to a certain point but suddenly buckles out entirely

The next case considered was the case of a strut
hinged at the two supports with axial load and
equal moments at the ends which \vere in the same
direction so that a reverse curvature was created
in the strut. This is another case which appears on
the surface to have a finite deflection until Pcr =

the strut shows the strut to be unstable for anything
over Per = —p— .
Let the original deflection = y,. Give the bar an
additional deflection v- = A sin^and then the total

deflection will equal y = yl -\- y.,.
If there is a decrease in the energy of the system
when its deflection curve is changed by the amount

system the beam would return to its original posi-
tion.
The following energy changes accompany the ad-
ditional deflection:

By Professor Walter C. Sadler
The history of court procedure shows that orig-
inally the jury was a body of men chosen for
their knowledge of the controversy at bar. These
men had seen the crime committed, or were
present when the contract was entered into. With
the passage of time the system underwent a dis-
tinct change, until today we find that the jury is
chosen from men with no opinion as to the issues
in the law suit. Thus it has become the function
of the jury to listen, unbiased, to all of the facts,
and then render its opinion as to the merits of the
controversy.
Because of this change it became essential that
the testimony of each witness be confined to the
presentation of the facts as he knows them, and
that he must never try to influence the jury by
offering his opinion as to the evidence before the
court. This appears to be the historical develop-
ment of the rule of evidence that "opinion evidence"
is not admissable.
The Alabama case of Stennett vs Bessemer, 45 S.
890, is in point. An issue had been raised as to
property damage from stream pollution. The wit-
ness testified what foreign matter was in the stream
and then added that this pollution made the prop-
erty unhealthy and uninhabitable. The court sus-
tained an objection to this opinion evidence, as the
witness was no better acquainted with public health
than the jury, and the conclusion to be drawn from
the facts should be reserved for the jury.
It is stated that the "exception proves the rule",
and such is the case at hand. The two most notable
exceptions are where the witness cannot state the
facts without expressing his opinion and where the
jury cannot properly analyze the facts without the
assistance of the witness's opinion. A witness could
describe the flushed face, high pitched voice and
uncontrolled language of the defendant in a criminal
suit, leaving the jury to decide whether the man
was angry or not. The law has adopted a common
sense solution of the problem, however, and per-
mits the witness to testify in his opinion, that the
defendant was angry. Thought will suggest other
similar exceptions where long descriptions by the
witness are inadequate.
The second part of these exceptions presents a
problem of particular interest to the engineer. This

Statwlind
The operation of this plant would be a proper subject
for expert testimony
witness is called an "expert", and his opinion is de-
sired because he can better analyze the effects of
certain technical facts than can an untrained jury.
It is a function of the court to decide whether the
subject-matter is appropriate for the opinion evi-
dence of an expert. For instance, in the case of
Prickett vs Sulzberger &amp; Sons. 167 P. 356, the issue
of the fact turned on the proper lighting of an ele-
vator. An effort was made to bring in an electrical
engineer, skilled in illumination, but the court held
that electric lighting is so generally understood that
the testimony of an expert could hardly aid the jury.
The subject-matter of expert opinion must not be
within the general knowledge of men.
Most cases do not run into this difficulty, how-
ever. Manufacturing presents a number of contro-
versies where the material of construction is ques-
tioned. It is evident that this is a distinctly tech-
nical issue, and expert opinion is necessary. McFaul
vs Madera Flume and Trading Company, 66 P. 308
is a case in point dealing with the relative safety of
cast iron and wrought iron for a particular part of a
machine. Professor Zimmerschied of Michigan
State College, an expert in metallurgy and qualita-
tive analysis, was called as a witness in the case of
Potvin vs West Bay City Shipbuilding Company,
120 N. W. 613. The issue was raised over an al-
leged defective tool, and the amount of temper in
it. He was allowed to introduce photographs of
the metal, enlarged 100 and 1000 times, and to give
his opinion of the temper in the tool. Of course the
average juryman would require assistance in a tech-
nical situation like this.
The method of operating a plant presents some
particularly technical questions. Thus, in Judson
vs Giant Powder Company, 40 P. 1020, the plaintiff
was seeking recovery for property injuries due to a
terrific explosion in a powder factory. He intro-
duced the testimony of experts to show that the

Power
A converted 100 H.P. N.A.C. gasoline engine to operate
on hydrogen and air, alternatively as a normal
gasoline engine.
HYDROGEN ENGINES
The production of excess power during load fluc-
tuation and off peak periods has offered many prob-
lems in the operation of hydro plants. However,
the introduction of a new engine, known as the
Erren engine, may aid greatly in the future. As a
fuel, this engine burns hydrogen mixed with either
oxygen, air or fuel oil. The hydrogen itself may be
produced as a by-product or by two types of electro-
lyzers invented in Germany which give gases at
30,000 pounds pressure without a compressor. Both
of these methods are economical and advantageous,
in spite of the lower thermal efficiency of hydrogen
than coal. One of the many advantages of this en-
gine is the innocuous exhaust consisting entirely
of steam and nitrogen, both of which are harmless.
Regardless of the belief that Hydrogen and Oxy-
gen would combine and form a smaller volume and
so make the engine impractical, the engine is quite
practical and the theory of its operation is quite
simple in its general nature. The H., and O;, mole-
cules combine and form steam leaving the N2 free.
When ignited, the heat generated is taken up by
the Nitrogen, with a steam nucleus, and thus it acts
as an expanding medium. When Oxygen is used
alone, some expanding medium is needed and is
usually in the form of air which is let in. Such
engines can also use liquid fuels which are first
vaporized in the usual manner and mixed with the
hydrogen at some later stage. When H2 is added
to a normal gasoline engine, the power was in-
creased 30 per cent, the gas consumption decreased
50 per cent, and the idling greatly reduced. A strik-
ing fact is that the thermal efficiency of this type
of engine approaches 50 per cent.
The construction is similar to gas engines, and
differs by being provided with special Hydrogen feed
valve and gear. Almost any engine can be converted
to use either gasoline or H2. The illustration shows
Notes of the

ession
one type of conversion. The Hydrogen valves are in
a case screwed onto the cylinder head and the pro-
jecting valve stems are actuated by a cam shaft.
This camshaft is arranged on a bracket on the side
of the engine and is driven by a chain off a sprocket
attached to the extended end of the normal cam-
shaft or crank shaft. Hydrogen is fed to the engine
at atmospheric pressure or slightly over by means
of a rubber tube and a manifold. Air is fed through
normal inlet valves. According to engineers, con-
version during which the compression ratio remains
the same will reduce the output, but this may be
overcome by increasing the feed pressure which is
virtually supercharging the Hydrogen.
One important test was run in which the exhaust
pipe was connected to the air manifold in order to
re-feed the exhaust steam. The engine was first
started on air after which the exhaust was mixed
with oxygen and re-run throught the cylinders. The
engine worked satisfactorily on this closed circuit.
The experiment seems impossible, but the explana-
tion lies in the fact that some of the steam con-
densed in the manifold.
Various methods and mixtures have been tried
with continued success and the potential field of
application is encouraging. Their use in mines and
submarines may become widespread due to innocu-
ous exhaust and the fact that air is not required
for running. Furthermore, the exhaust steam will
tend to moisten the air and so be an asset. Their
use may extend to the driving of low pressure tur-
bines and steam engines, and even for heating
rooms and thereby increasing the thermal efficiency
of the Erren engine.

BLADE erosion is one of the more serious prob-
lems of turbine maintenance, and recent data
shows that outages from blade troubles in-
creased during 1932. In many cases these outages
are due to blade erosion, and attention has been
given to mitigate these disturbances.
Erosion occurs in all makes of turbines although
it is more serious in low pressure stages in which
the tip speeds exceed 950 f.p.s., and where the mois-
ture content is high. When the tip speed is below
900 f.ps. or when the steam has been reheated as
on high pressure units, this problem is less trouble-
some.
Illustration shows erosion on last blade row of
impulse-reaction turbine after one year of service.
The tip speed is 977 f.p.s. and the moisture does not
exceed 10.5 per cent at any load.
A study indicates that erosion is dependent on
hours but not necessarily on the load. Also that
the erosion is confined to the outer half of the blade
and particularly within the section 1"-1.5" from
the end. Moreover, it is most serious on the front
surface near the outer lacing wire. It is not thor-
oughly understood what is the chief cause for such
erosion, but various explanations have been offered.
The moisture content is considered as one cause and
for this reason many turbines have draining grooves
and leak holes from the low pressure stages to the
condenser because of the high content in the last
blade rows. However, the effectiveness of this is
not known. Several cases show erosion at the dew-
point, suggesting the possibility of Oxygen in the
feedwater. To insure against such a possibility,
complete de-aeration is needed. It is also found
that increased superheat due to changes in boiler
plant seem to materially reduce erosion. Another
method of reducing the erosion is by moving the
outer lacing wire near to the shaft.
In the earlier stages it has been customary to
build up blades with silversolder and so produce
longer wear. Experience shows that the ends of
unshrouded blades corrode badly and therefore in-
crease clearance and decrease efficiency usually be-
tween 1-1.5 per cent. In the effort to increase the
life of turbine blades, various new bladings of Asco-
loy, stainless and chrome steel have been tried but
as yet their lives have not been determined. Also,
coatings and sheaths for wearing edges have been
tried but the subject deserves the further study of
designers.

Blade erosion in low pressure stage of a steam turbi
there has been very little known concerning this
field until recently. Reports from Professor Nagel
and Dr. Holfelder showed much progress in this
field using sensitive and inertia free instruments.
The Piezo electric method was used to indicate
the pressure cycle, while thermo-couples indicated
the temperature. The characteristics of the Piezo
method are the capacity of substances to charge
themselves when subject to either compressive or
tensile forces; in this case quartz crystals were used.
Various tests were run, and it was found that
some fuels ignited slowly and caused jerky running
but the addition of tetraline greatly improved it.
This was especially true of tar oil.
However, the greatest effect was found to be the
conditions surrounding the injection itself. To ob-
serve the effects, nozzles were set in chambers with
glass slits and the jet shadows were photographed
with a spark exposure of one one-millionth of a
second. It was found that a fine distribution of fuel
which is necessary for complete combustion, oc-
curred with a high back pressure in the chamber
rather than a high injection pressure. Also the
best angle of jet occurs with open nozzles (not
closed by needle) having round noses, but the great-
est depth is reached with conical nozzles tapered at
the front end. Illustration shows influence of en-
largement of inlet pipe which increases the dura-
tion of injection. The fuel delivery occurs during
the 18° pump shaft rotation.

The Engineering Arch in May
A Reform
The University of Michigan has long exemplified
the old saying that "great bodies move slowly";
it has been particularly reluctant to adopt student
suggestions. It is therefore with especial pride and
gratitude that we note that certain measures advo-
cate by The Technic have been adopted.
It will be recalled that last semester this publi-
cation through its editorial page, under the titles of
Open Book Exams and Memory vs. Brains, called
the attention of its readers to certain methods and
courses in the Engineering College which had ac-
quired the reputation of being "gripes", due to the
fact that exams were given on almost a pure mem-
ory basis. Conspicuous among them was Ch. E. 1,
particularly distressing because all engineers are
required to take it. Its existence as a memory
course caused the feeling that not only were mat-
ters being made unpleasant for the students, but
that the benefits attainable were greatly reduced.
We are happy to point out the fact that, largely
through the efforts of The Technic, this matter has
been corrected. The course is now on an open book
basis throughout, including daily recitations and all
examinations. The present system approximates
the conditions under which the engineer must work
in his profession far more closely than did the old
one. We extend our thanks and our congratula-
tions to Professor J. C. Brier and his associates
for the change. —A. W.
Science and Engineering
In the past decade, more than fifty varieties of
engineering have been developed, including such
remote branches as commercial engineering and so-
called human engineering. This is a far 'cry from
the engineering profession of a generation ago,
when the engineer was regarded principally as a
Edit
ona is
scientist or mathematician with only an indirect
relation to economics.
However, while engineering has been broadening
and growing away from science, important changes
in the scientific world have also occurred. In con-
sequence of the borrowing of the term "science"
to designate many unrelated types of human en-
deavor, a confusion as to its meaning exists. We
even hear of the science of pugilism, or the science
of contract bridge, to mention but two of many
examples.
With the advent of all this branching out and
overlapping of the two fields, the necessity of dis-
tinguishing between them arises. Although science
and engineering maintain the closest of relation-
ships, there is a fundamental difference between
them which cannot be regarded as irrelevant. Sci-
ence is "an ordered knowledge of natural phenomena
and the relation between them". Scientists disre-
gard all sentimentality, all human prejudice, all
personal opinion, and seek to discern the truth as
evidenced by the paradoxes of nature. In the appli-
cation of this principle by Galileo, Faraday. Pasteur,
and innumerable others, the evolution of modern
science has proceeded rapidly. This evolution rep-
resents the ever-increasing power of man over
nature, the domination of the natural forces of the
world by human will.
But here the function of the engineer makes itself
evident. Engineering is the art of the economic
application of science to the purposes of man.
Whereas the scientists may conceive a principle, he
who applies this principle to the economic benefit
of man is an engineer.
In other words, the standard by which the engi-
neer is measured is utility—economic utility. All
his material accomplishments are measured in
dollars and cents, and he is successful only when
he can do with one dollar what the untrained man
can do with two.
Thus the engineer is inextricably woven into the
economic structure of society. He is intrusted with
the expenditure of other people's money and must
be thoroughly familiar with the appliance of eco-
nomic principles. And therein lies the difference be-
tween science and engineering. The former is ab-
stract, and involves the evolution of scientific prin-
ciples, while the latter is the practical application of
these principles to the economic benefit of man.

and
Seeking Forward
Exactly two years ago. in the May, 1931 issue of
this magazine, the Managing Editor, then a lowly
tryout, wrote an editorial entitled, "Ol' Man De-
pression". Intended to cheer the graduates of that
year, the article was full of flowery phrases such
as, "greater things always rise from their ashes"
and "better conditions than we have ever known
are coming". Two years later we find that these
prophecies have not come true. The depression and
its attendant evils, like the poor seem to be always
with us. Conditions, if changed at all, are worse
than they were at that time. The country and the
world, still suffering, wonder when it will end and
ask, "Why have such things come to be?" •
Even the lowest laborer, watching his very sus-
tenance being taken from him, has asked this ques-
tion. But he has received no answer from a world
steeped in economic dogma, worn out policies and
stilted individualism. World leaders and industrial
lords, asking the same question, grope about for
their "lost causes" and "lost markets" and either see
nothing, or, on seeing a glimmering of a way to-
ward advancement, will not accept it because it is
contrary to their principles. And the unbiased ob-
server watches and wonders whether Spengler's
prophecy of the ruin of Western civilization will
not come to pass even before he himself expected it.
"We are passing through the darkest days the
world has ever known". Hearing these words re-
peated by men of authority, by men in totally dif-
ferent spheres, by men who have carefully weighed
the present order of life and not only found it want-
ing but full of great, gapping incongruities, one is
sure to ask, Why Iiavc snch things comc to be? In
the country produce is fed to livestock or left to
rot because the farmer can not market it, while in
the cities thousands slowly starve because they can
not procure the same produce. Taxation has be-
come so burdensome, that it becomes an ever in-
creasing problem, threatening our very existence.
Charity is asked of persons who are in need of char-
ity themselves. By a wave of his hand an indus-
trial magnate throws thousands out of work. Thou-
sands whose meager wages are the sole dependence
of other thousands. Other individuals, by a slight
manipulation, paralyze the financial systems of a
state or country. Numberless people are sucked
into the vortex, their entire life changed, their means
of livelihood removed and the zest of living com-
pletely annihilated. Bewildered by it all, they ask,
"When shall it end? What is wrong with our pres-
ent day order that it allows such things to be?"
The present day depression is not the main point
of discussion here but merely a gigantic emphasis
on a much larger question. For if the present con-
dition passes, another of similar nature is sure to
succeed it. Where is the answer? Does it lie in
those words which fill the press of the nation and
the world? Socialism! Communism! THE MA-
CHINE! Inflation! Capitalism! Dictatorship!
It is this problem the present generation must
face without swerving. Men must learn to forget
the ever foremost "I". Initiative, free private enter-
prise and individualism are glorious words but when
their cost becomes as tremendous as it is today, is
it not time to discard them? Where one man reaches
the top, winning world wealth and fame for himself,
thousands of others are kept in subjection and when
conditions appear, such as those through which we
are now passing, they are subjected to the crudest
torture possible, that of denying their children food.
Those now in power must be the leaders in such
a movement, for the masses lack ability in organi-
zation of this kind. The masses can only organize
to destroy! World leaders must consider society
as a whole and forget themselves, for after all, they
are not eternally important. They must view life
with the broadness of a Schopenhauer when he
says, "A man finds himself, to his great astonish-
ment suddenly existing, after thousands of years of
non-existence; he lives a little while and then, again,
comes an equally long time when he must exist no
more". Shall an individual's tiny contribution to
the march of time be wealth and fame, or, shall it be
aid in the commencement and carrying on of a
plan which shall insure the security and happiness
of future generations?
Spengler cites the spiritual transformation which
has grown with man through the ages—collective
doing by plan. However, we would point out that
this planning has not been for the benefit of the
group but on the large, for the benefit of individuals.
From entirely disconnected tribes, men have moved
closer and closer together, until today millions re-
side in the cramped limits of a city. They have
moved together bodily but not spiritually. Why
have not the Christian nations of the world taken
to heart the words of their Teacher and planned for
the good of the group?
The need for some such plan is imminent! It must
be carefully worked out and must not be some fran-
tically concocted panacea, conceived under stress
and lack of time. It must not be a Technocracy, a

Notes
Surveying at Camp Davis
Camp Davis
Camp Davis offers much to students in the way
of instruction and experience. The journey from
Ann Arbor to the camp and return, the trips from
the camp to the Yellowstone Park and the Jackson
Hole Country, and the exploration of the nearby
mountains are interesting and inspiring.
Living conditions at the camp are almost ideal.
Centering about an excellent mess are comfortable,
well equipped residence buildings, hot and cold
showers, a modern sanitary system, electric lights,
and a library for general reading.
The country adjacent to the camp provides every
advantage for field work in surveying. The climate
and numerous scenic features attract visitors from
every state and from many foreign countries each
summer.
The average cost per student approximates $150.
This includes all necessary expenses and the cost of
travel to nearby points of interest.
The session for 1933 begins on Monday, June 26.
Students should reach the camp on Saturday the
24th. The fee of $42 -is paid at Ann Arbor. The
deposit of $60 to support the mess is made at the
camp.
Stump Speakers' Society
Sigma Rho Tau, The Stump Speaker's Society, is
again finishing a successful year. Intercollegiate
debates are now going on between the University
of Michigan chapter of the society and chapters at
Michigan State College, City College of Detroit
and Detroit Institute of Technology. The subject
for debate this year is ''Resolved that over 50 per
cent of all state and local revenues should be de-
rived from sources other than the taxes on prop-
erty".
The Fourth Annual Tung Oil Banquet of the
Society will be held at the Union on May 31. This
is one of the most important events on the Engi-
neering Calendar and should not be missed by any
of the student body. Dean Emeritus Cooley, Dean
Sadler, Assistant Dean Lovell and prominent mem-
bers of the faculty will be among those present.
The many honors of the society, won during the
school year now ending, will also be presented at
this time.
A number of neophytes recently became novices
when the engineers' Stump Speakers Society held
its annual spring initiation.
The initiation, in the traditional form, consisted
of speeches by the neophytes, who stood on the
familiar stump and delivered orations on the virtues
of tung-oil and its uses. The tung-oil is symbolic
of that smoothness and gloss in speech, common to
good speakers. A nut from a Chinese tung-oil tree
was also planted with the appropriate ceremonies.
After two years of successful speaking in the
society as a novice, a member is eligible to join
Sigma Rho Tau, the engineers' intercollegiate
speaking fraternity.
In the evening, the formal initiation for Sigma
Rho Tau was held in the Union. Professors Wm.
H. Egly and Harry S. Wilder, both of the Engi-
neering English Department, were among the
initiated.
The following engineers were taken in as novices
in the Stump Speakers Society during the open-air
ceremonies: D. B. Stewart, '36, R. A. Lowe, '36,
W. W. Dalee, '36, E. W. Bottum, '33, F. L. Otter,

172 applicants for the six fellowships, specified this
University as their choice for the school in which
to take their graduate work. The Massachusetts
Institute of Technology was the only institution
rating higher than Michigan in the number of ap-
plicants desiring to continue their work there.
The Tau Beta Pi Fellowships were first created
four years ago with a stipend of $750 for carefully
selected members of Tau Beta Pi in order to enable
them to do a year's graduate work. This year,
however, the stipend is $650. During the four
years the fellowships have been given, 23 awards
were made, amounting to $17,250.
A. I. Ch. E.
The A. I. Ch. E. at its March meeting was ad-
dressed by Henry Hess, consulting chemical engi-
neer formerly with Libby Owens and the J. B. Ford
Glass Co.
Mr. Hess spoke on the various phases of the
glass industry, its problems and emphasized the
necessity of having a knowledge of fuel and asso-
ciated matters in order to solve these problems.
He discussed the problem of manufacturing a
laminated shatterproof glass which doesn't turn
yellow when exposed to ultra-violet rays.
The meeting, held in the chapter rooms in the
East Engineering Building, was followed by re-
freshments.
A. I. E. E.
The A.I.E.E., at its regular meeting on Tuesday
evening, March 21, heard Dr. H. S. Osborn of the
American Telephone and Telegraph Company
speak on the measurement of the efficiencies of
telephone circuits. Dr. Osborn in his talk made
use of slides to illustrate some of the equipment
used and graphs to emphasize certain parts of his
subject. He also played several records showing
the effects of suppressing different frequencies in a
telephone circuit. The effect of room noises and
other extraneous sounds, known as "side talk" in
the professional jargon, were also demonstrated.
Dr. Osborn concluded his talk by citing some of
the difficulties encountered with long distance tele-
phonic communication. Of these, the so-called
transient phenomena, that is, the distortion result-
ing from the differences in the velocity of the pro-
pagation of the different frequencies, and the echoes
caused by the retransmission of energy along long
distance cables, were illustrated with phonograph
records. This meeting also constituted the Bell System
Contact Program.
Major Edwards is leaving!
The man who has been at the
head of the local Reserve Officers'
Training Corps for the last four
years, during which he has won
the respect and admiration of stu-
dents and faculty alike, is to be
transferred to Washington.
Major Basil D. Edwards, whose
full title is Professor of Military
Science and Tactics, will give up
his post here on August 31, to
take up a position in the office of
the Assistant Secretary of War,
in charge of Industrial Mobiliza-
tion, that is, the organization of industry in time
of war.
A graduate of the U. S. Military Academy in the
class of 1912, he received his L.L.B. and degree of
Master of Laws at the Harvard Law School. He
calls military work his vocation, law his avocation.
Coming to the University in July, 1929, Major
Edwards took active charge of the R.O.T.C. unit.
This had been organized in 1917, to succeed the
Student Army Training Corps, of which the Mich-
igan group was the largest maintained by any uni-
versity during the war. Under his direction, the
unit has grown year by year, until at present there
are 536 students enrolled, of which number 150 are
taking the Advanced Course, which leads to a com-
mission as Second Lieutenant in the Officers' Re-
serve Corps. The Major praises the fine support
and cooperation which he has received from the
University.
Active in the Rotary Club of Ann Arbor, and the
local service organizations, he lists among his close
friends President Alexander G. Ruthven, Assistant
Dean A. H. Lovell and Professor W. H. Hobbs.
During his time here he has acted as Faculty Ad-
viser to Scabbard and Blade, the honorary military
fraternity. He stands "ace high" with every mem-
ber of the unit, from his brother officers to the
newest "basic."
His loss will be deeply felt, for he has been the
guiding spirit responsible for the present high posi-
tion of the Corps. Though his numerous friends
are reluctant to see the Major leave, he has the wish
of every one of them for success in his new position.
Each of the R.O.T.C. officers stationed at the
University will spend the summer at one of the
numerous camps, either working with the students
who go to camp for six weeks as part of their
course, or with the C.M.T.C.
Captain R. N. Lord has already gone to Camp
Custer where he is assigned to duty with the Civil-
ian Conservation Corps. Later on he will take up

The first Chemistry Building on the Campus and the
present Chemisty Building
THIS being the last issue of the school year,
we should like to talk a bit about this section
of the Technic and how it concerns you.. As
you probably realize, the Alumni notes section is
one which depends for its interest to the reader
upon the reader himself. In other words, it is quite
impossible for us to write up a series of notes unless
we receive some sort of communication from you.
If this section is to be interesting to you and your
fellow grads, it must be alive and up to date. It
can be made and kept this way only through your
cooperation. If you follow these notes monthly
and enjoy reading about your friends, as we hope
you do, the best way of letting us know it is to
write a few lines about yourself on a penny post
card and drop it in the nearest mailbox. It will
not only give your classmates the same pleasure
you get when you see their names in print, but it
will let us know that something more than merely
casual interest is being taken in this part of the
Technic. This section is yours and can be made
only what you are wont to make of it. Sometime
between now and our first fall issue, we hope you
will make an effort to contribute your share toward
making this section more interesting and alive than
it has been in the past. Anything in the way of
news about yourself will be heartily welcomed by
us and appreciated by other readers.
But we've commented enough on that so we will
present a few bits of news abount members of the

Fred M. Zeder, '09, M.E.
Again this month we feature a member of the
class of 1909. Since his graduation from the Me-
chanical Engineering Department, Fred M. Zeder
has had a varied and interesting career, and today
he is one of the most outstanding engineers in the
automotive field. He is a director of the Detroit
Athletic Club, a past president of the Society of
Automotive Engineers, and he is an honorary mem-
ber of Tau Beta Pi. All of this in addition to his
duties as Chief Engineer of Chrysler Motors Cor-
poration.
Immediately after graduation, Fred Zeder started
his rapid advance by working in the Allis Chalmers
shops in Milwaukee. The following year he took
charge of the laboratories of the E.M.F. Corp. in
Detroit. At the early age of twenty-six, Mr. Zeder
was appointed Consulting Engineer of the Stude-
baker Corp., and the following year saw him become
Chief Engineer of that company. At the time he
was the youngest man in such a position in this
country. Mr. Zeder continued with Studebaker
until 1920, and during this time he developed the
Big Six, Special Six, Light Six, and Four, four cars
which made his company one of the leaders of the
industry.
In 1920 Mr. Zeder was offered the job of super-
vising the operations of a new fifteen million dol-
lar plant for the Willys Company in Newark, N. J.
He brought his eighty Engineering associates and
followers with him to the new work, all of whom
had previously been with him, and it was here that
he first met Mr. Walter Chrysler, whom Mr. Willys
had secured as Vice President and General Mana-
ger of the new plant. When this work was com-
pleted in 1921 Mr. Zeder independently designed a
car of his own. This was never put in production,
however, as Mr. Chrysler had by this time organ-
ized his own concern and decided to incorporate

Richard N. Cogger
Richard N. Cogger, '33E, who has just completed
what has been his fourth term as managing editor,
walked for the first time in Detroit some one score
years ago. He proceeded, unremarkably enough,
to grow up and attach himself to the little red
schoolhouse on the outskirts of Detroit—the Red-
ford Township school, to be precise. There he
started his career as a managing editor in addition
to indulging in that primeval collegiate pastime of
breaking his nose a few times—he doesn't say how
—and taking the school bell out of the steeple.
His activities in the Strathmoor Junior High were
rather tame after such a stirring beginning. At one
time or another, he was editor-in-chief of the school
paper, chairman of the student council, a member
of the basketball team, an officer of the class, and
president of the Strathmoor High-Y, not to men-
tion other equally fertile positions for an embryo
politician. He made such progress that to list his
doings in the senior high, would present a task so
Gargantuan as to be almost infeasible. For in-
stance, not being content to stick to academic func-
tions, he had to cavort on the ice hockey team, be
No. 1 man on the tennis team, and Presdient of his
Senior class. He also succeeded in getting himself
the lead in the senior play. He played the role of
a love-sick young man whom none of the girls could
resist. They've a law against that sort of thing,
back east.
His scholastic career, much as it pains us to ad-
mit this, is most enviable. He managed to lay his
hands on all the awards available, including the
second place in the Kdison scholarship competition
for the state of Michigan, and had to graduate with
a Summa Cum Laude diploma and four years of a
straight All-A record. We thank our lucky stars
to be able to get even a paper one.
In 1929, for some unknown reason, he came to
the University of Michigan, a would-be chemical
engineer. With a straight 4.0 he was amply qual-
ified to be initiated in Phi Eta Sigma, freshman
honorary society. He also began his term as a try-

Mr. Harold O. Seamans, '33E, now the latest ex-
editor of the Technic, originated, originally enough,
in Fort Collins. Colorado. That was in 1911. Ap-
parently, he must have been a nomadic character,
even in "them thar days", for his elementary edu-
cation seems to have wandered to California and
back again to Colorado. In any vent, he acquired
a dislike, or perhaps it would be more accurate to
say an indifferent attitude, when it came to the
girls, if the act of disturbing their peace in the
schoolroom with itching powder, is at all indicative.
This ruffled the principal's ire, we are told. It
would ruffle ours, too. But then, in his high school
days, he got to be editor of the Ft. Collins High
School paper, "Spilled-Ink", president of the chem-
istry club, secretary of the student council, a mem-
ber of the first debating team, and was elected to
the National High School Honorary Society. His
misdemeanors were forgiven.
1929. Seamans is now an almighty high school
graduate, and graduating with honors at that. Be-
ing a gullible soul, he came to Michigan because
somebody told him it was a good place to go to.
He wore a pot. They were still in vogue then. He
joined the Triangle fraternity. Then he got him-
self a Phi Eta Sigma key—after
meeting the necessary require-
ments. In the spring of 1930, he
came to the Technic office as a try-
out and never showed up again.
To proceed more chronologic-
ally, in his second year he became
a member of Alpha Nu, the debat-
ing society. And what is well-nigh
phenomenal, he became publica-
tions editor of the Technic. Fortu-
nately for Triangles, he was only
the class secretary.
As a junior, he exhibited a not
at all unremarkable talent for pea-
nut politics. He was a member of
two dance committees, the J-Hop
and the Slide Rule committee. It
may be appropriate at this point
to divulge some of his idiosyn-

Another aid to business
... a Telctypewriter "Central"
Working out new ways to serve the communi-
cation needs of the public is an objective always
in the minds of Bell System men. The new Tele-
typewriter Exchange Service —typing by wire—
is an example.
For some years Private Wire Teletypewriter
Service has speeded communication between sep-
arated units of many large organizations. Tele-
phone men —anxious to make this service more
widely useful —have now established Teletype-
writer central offices, through which any sub-
scriber to the service may be connected directly
with any other subscriber. Both can type back
and forth — their messages being reproduced sim-
ultaneously at each point.
This new service provides fast, dependable com-
munication and does for the written word what
telephone service does for the spoken word. It
is one more Bell System contribution to busi-
ness efficiency.

Life
SPRING FEVER
It is a wild-eyed Engineer,
And a sorry sight is he
As he standeth in the Engine Arch
And make to stoppeth me.
"The classroom's doors are open wide
And I should he within.
The class is met. The bluebook set
Before them. They begin."
He holds me with his tearful eye—
He will not let me go,
And in a choking, croaking voice
Pours forth this tale of woe:
"Full many a moon," quoth he, "have I
My studies well pursued.
But with the spring I find myself
No more in studious mood.
"The prof endeavors mightily
His theories to explain.
I spend the hour in pleasant dreams
Of castles built in Spain.
"I think of naught save wond'rous hours
'Xeath star bespangled sky
We spent last night, we two, alone,
My light of love and I.
"I own my duty bade me keep
My rendezvous with books,
But sparkling eyes bade otherwise—
To seek secluded nooks.
"My friend," he plead, "as man to man,
How can one think to toil
When he can find such pleasant ways
To burn that midnight oil?"
My heart—it broke of sympathy
As his story he did tell.
For I know exactly how he felt
And brother—it is HELL.
That Little Gal From the South
Miss Culpepper was a dainty little sketch from
the sunny South. For some reason which will per-
haps forever remain a mystery she was in our
Chemistry 5E class, and we all liked her immensely.
Old Beetlebrow was teaching the course at the
time and there never was a more thoroughly dis-
liked prof. We each secretly cherished hopes of
"hanging the bird on him." One day, in search of
an unknown, Miss Culpepper was patiently boiling
a vile-smelling mess. Old Beetlebrow suddenly
appeared out of nowhere. Glaring down at her
and pointing an accusing finger at the offensive
concoction he demanded in a voice that made the
windows rattle, "What the devil is that?" Slowly,
deliberately she turned, met his fierce gaze with
her beautiful big brown eyes. "What." she queried
in that soft Southern drawl that would melt a heart
of stone, "What in the hell do you think it is?"
—and Not a Single "Class A" Job Has Gone By Yet
The "Board of Estimates" is again holding its
Spring meetings under the Engine Arch. Experi-
enced "Estimators" are again astonishing neo-
phyte's with lightning-like calculations of the prop-
erties of feminine models that pass through on in-
spection. Specimens are immediately classified as
to tonnage, maneuverability, and amount and posi-
tion of ballast by the representatives of the Uept.
of Marine Engineering. Mechanical Engineering
delegates estimate the compression ratio, speed
under full load, and braking power. Aero students
decide on the efficiency of streamlining and height
of ceiling when equipped with supercharger. Elec-
trical Engineers concern themselves with the re-
sistance, insulation, and susceptibility to shock.
Metallurgists calculate the depth of chill, hardness,
and deformation. These meetings are held at the
stroke of the hour (any hour) under the Arch and
are open to all those who care to attend—or can't
think of anything else to do.
Josh Billings, who never went to college, says,
"About the hardest thing a fellow kan do iz to spark

endangered. Not even the lordly senior can main-
tain proper decorum on such an uncertain founda-
tion as a pair of well-oiled roller skates. As for a
well-oiled senior on well-oiled roller skates—well,
we leave the rest to your imagination.
If At First You Don't Succeed—
A smashing, rending, tearing, crash assailed his
ears—but he would not turn back. The agonized
screech of dry metal rubbed against dry metal bade
him retreat—but he went ahead. Nothing could
swerve him from his purpose. There were obsta-
cles in his way, yes—but rather than deviate one
inch from his course he would crush them. Slowly
he crept ahead. Time after time his progress was
checked and each time there came to him the
thought that he should go back, begin anew, and
choose another course—but al-
ways his manhood beckoned him
onward. He was stopped. It
seemed that this last great ob-
stacle was insurmountable, would
cheat him of the goal just beyond.
He tensed himself, every nerve
and fiber of his body was stressed
to its elastic limit. With that last
supreme effort came a surge of
ecstasy as he felt himself being
carried forward. Victory was his.
His face wreathed in a self-sati-
fied smile, the worthy member of
the faculty stepped jauntily from
the car he had just succeeded in
parking.
And it speaks of integrations and industrial rela-
tions.
Not to speak of profits, capital, and wages.
Forty pages in a lump is enough to make you hump.

If your good grades are your pride, you will wish
that you had died
Ere you took that awful economics course.
When they're handing out the grades, they have
three distinctive shades
And they label them as rotten, bad and worse.
I'd go on like this forever, if I thought that my
endeavor
Would serve to stop your going on a spree.
If you haven't got the guts to take chances going
nuts,
Stay away from Economics 53.

position. This type of composition board is used
quite extensively on the exterior walls of the Ad-
ministration Building. Other exterior wall mate-
rial, such as the composition used in the construc-
tion of the Hall of Science is five-eights inch thick
five-ply sheet fir plywood, coated at the factory with
water-proofing chemicals and painted to provide
protection against the weather. Gypsum board with
a special paper covering making it usable as an
exterior covering is used in the outside walls of the
Electrical Building.
Because the buildings are not to be used perma-
nently and most of them will be salvaged after the
Fair is over, every economical precaution in con-
struction was necessary. Cost of materials was low,
as \vell as labor costs, and the cost per cubic foot
for most of the buildings has been fifteen cents or
less. The Administration Building, a more expen-
sive structure, ran somewhat higher in cubic foot
costs.
In conclusion, after considering the main purpose
of the 1933 World's Exposition—to portray an
epical story of the achievements in science, and its
relationship to the progress of industry—one may
not stop to realize that this exhibit presents an-
other important purpose. The Exposition signifies
the rapid advancement of architecture. From the
standpoint of civic achievements, World's Fairs are
important current events, and their buildings are
often permanent additions to n country's architec-
ture, their type and design exerting definite influ-
ence upon the public taste and appeals.
The Exposition des Arts Decoratifs, held in Paris
a few years ago, was responsible for widespread
use and interest in modern design and decoration.
Chicago's first World's Fair went in strong for
classical design. The recent San Diego Exposition
popularized Moorish-Spanish architecture.

out on the Technic staff as well as serving on the
Honor Council during that first hectic year.
In his sophomore year he was elected to Tri-
angles, junior engineering honorary society. His
appointment as Alumni News Editor was an-
nounced in the spring of 1931.
During his junior year, his social instinct, or per-
haps more precisely, his society appeal, again be-
came prominent after a more or less lengthy hiber-
nation when he led the grand march at the Tri-
angles formal. His choice as Managing Editor of
the Technic occurred a little over a year ago, and
almost simultaneously with this, he was elected to
Tau Beta Pi. In keeping with his reputation, he
was executive chairman and treasurer of Triangles.
His senior year suffered a denouement when he
was elected to only three societies, Phi Kappa Phi,
all campus honorary, Sigma Xi, for those students
showing promise in the line of research, and Phi
Lambda Upsilon, honorary chemical engineering
society. All he did besides this, was to be chair-
man of the Slide Rule Dance Committee, and a
member of the Engineering Council. His crown-
ing glory, however, was when he was influential
enough to write and cause the adoption of a consti-
tution to govern the policies of the Technic. This
may seem, at first glance, to be a feather in his cap.
But in all due seriousness, even we must admit that
effects of this constitution will be more far-reaching
than a superficial consideration may lead one to
think.
As a final move, we might add that we are very
thankful that as chairman of the Slide Rule Dance com-
mittee, he didn't embarrass us by advertising the dance,
like some engineers of an eastern institution did on a
similar occasion, as one where: "Dress—Optional."
Maybe theirs was a stag affair.

coffer-dam and its rock blankets, and downstream
coffer-dam and its rock barrier and the rock pro-
tection on the two excavation slopes to bedrock
have all been completed. The four diversion tun-
nels completed and the river satisfactorily diverted
through them, then the government will accept in
writing the coffer-dams and rock barriers. After
which date the government will assume liabilities
for any damage to the work due to flood or other
causes not the fault of the contractor, but not for
damage to equipment. A bidding bond of $2,000,000
was required and a surety bond of $5,000,000.
The Government will furnish all materials enter-
ing permanently into the construction, with the
exception of sand and gravel, and these are to be
obtained from government pits. Thus the govern-
ment furnishes all cement, reinforcing, rails, wire
fabric, rods, bolts, pipe fittings, all hydraulic ma-
chinery and operating machinery.

THE EXPERT WITNESS
(Continued from page 9)
company was negligent in its manner of operation.
Highly skilled chemical engineers testified as to
plant operation and offered opinion evidence on the
issue. It is clear the subject-matter was beyond
the common knowledge of the ordinary jury.
Opinion evidence must be a plausible conclusion
from the facts as introduced. Winterringer vs War-
den Company, 95 X. W. 619, deals with this phase.
The issue was raised concerning a defective ma-
chine. The owner of the machine gave his opinion
that the machine was of no value whatsoever, but
he testified that the reaper in question cut grain
satisfactorily and that he had used it for three years.
His only specific complaint was the tying of the
bundles. The court held that his opinion was not
a logical conclusion of the facts he had testified to.
The matter of damages is somewhat troublesome.
Even an expert should not be allowed to give his
opinion as to the value of the injury sustained by
the plaintiff. That would be a clear cut invasion of
the function of the jury. On the other hand, there
may be cases where it is essential to secure the
technical assistance of an engineer. In Mathews vs
New York Central Railroad, 120 X. E. 185, the issue
was raised as to the cost of cleaning soot from a
building. Expert opinion was correctly received as
to the cost of doing this work. While the cost was
really the amount of the damages involved, still the
evidence was accepted merely as an engineering
estimate. This policy may appear odd, but it cer-
tainly has the background of years of legal deci-
sions. It is unquestionably logical. Similar cases
arise in the construction of railroad tracks, in log-
ging operations, or in the erection of buildings,
where the contractor has not done the work accord-
ing to specifications. The value of the damages
will amount to the cost of completing the work
according to the contract. The court reserves to
the jury the right to place whatever credulence it
pleases on the testimony and the numerical appli-
cation of the estimate to the circumstances of the
case.
Qualification
Opinion testimony is justified on the basis that
it will aid the jury in analyzing the testimony. It is

Accuracy counts for as much in manufacturing
and the making of Jenkins Valves is a good ex-
ample. Accuracy enters into every operation from
the choice of metals by competent metallurgists
to the rigid testing of the finished valves.
Castings for Jenkins Valves are sound and flaw-

evident, therefore, that the witness must have a
better knowledge of the facts than the jury has. In
short, he must be an exeprt. The court procedure
is so set up that the judge passes on the qualifica-
tions of the witness before he is allowed to testify.
The attorney calls the witness to the stand and asks
those questions which he believes will establish
that the witness is an expert. The opinion of the
judge is practically final, appeal being allowed only
where there is gross error.
The actual qualifications of an expert are some-
what elastic, and are governed by whether the jury
will actually be aided by the opinion testimony. For
this reason the expert must be able carefully to
observe all of the facts, and to arrive at a logical
conclusion. He must be trained in his profession
out and beyond the normal accomplishment of the
jury. For instance, in Vohs vs Shorthill and Co.,
100 N. W. 495, a practical machinist was qualified
to testify that chips are liable to fly from a certain
type of shop work, because his opinion dealt with a
subject generally not within the knowledge of men.
Scott vs Astoria Railroad, 72 Pac. 594, is another
case where the court holds strictly to the purpose
of expert testimony. Professor W. J. Roberts of
Washington State College was allowed to give
opinion testimony on the proper slope of banks in
a railroad cut, although he had no experience in the
railroad field. He was an expert in excavation work
and had extensive training in the construction of
canals, ditches, and highways.
The legal profession is relying more and more
upon the expert witness to present the facts in cases.
Sometimes this testimony is brought out by charts
and diagrams, sometimes by hypothetical questions
or by field investigations. Where experts are
brought in by both sides there are bound to be dif-
ferences of professional opinion, with the conse-
quent undermining of public confidence in expert
testimony. While there may be members of the
engineering profession whose testimony can be
bought for a price, it is clear that this group is in
the minority. This is one place in which the engi-
neer should ever hold to the high standards of his
profession.

use and exhibition in Radio City theaters. Known
as the harmonium, it looks from the outside like a
grand piano, but its inwards show a very different
sort of construction. Although it has strings which
are struck by hammers manipulated by the keys, as
is the case with the piano, the sounding board is
replaced by eighteen miniature microphones placed
throughout the interior assembly. These micro-
phones do the work of the sounding board by pick-
ing up the sounds generated by the vibrating strings
and amplifying them so that they can be heard at

of electrical equipment such as we are familiar with
in the ordinary radio, and the final result is emitted
from a loud speaker in the side of the harmonium.
But this new method is far superior to the old
sounding hoard method in that it allows an ex-
tremely great variation in the quality of the tone
emitted from the instrument. It is said that it is
possible by means of the harmonium to produce the
effect of any given instrument in a symphony or-
chestra, and, we may suppose, a few instruments
that aren't in a symphony orchestra. A remarkable
feature is that the player has control of the notes
for fifty-six seconds after the keys are struck; this
allows the introduction of a great many new effects.
PLATINUM
Some interesting facts concerning the metal plat-
inum were recentlv disclosed at the annual meeting
of the American Institute of Mining and Metallur-
gical Engineers by E. M. Wise, assistant director
of the International Nickel Company Research
Laboratory. As compared with a total world pro-
duction of gold to date of more than one billion
ounces, less than 12,000,000 ounces of platinum
have been produced. There are sufficient deposits
of the metal, however, to assure an adequate supply
of it for future generations.
One obvious and important use of platinum is in
the making of jewelry. In normal times, about
$^0,000,000 worth of platinum jewelry is sold in the
United States annually. A new process also makes
it possible to use platinum for decorating dinner
sets and for building ornamentation.
But platinum has many uses purely in the field
of engineering because of its qualities of resistance
to high temperature and to corrosion and because
of its properties as catalvst. It has, through its
catalytic properties, made possible the economical
production of nitric acid, and hence of synthetic
nitrates for fertilizer. Because of the high melting
point of metals in the platinum group and their
freedom from oxidation, it is possible to construct
electric furnaces operating at temperatures up to
3600 degrees F.

The conclusion is that for the bar to remain stable
the end load must be less than Euler's critical load
for the bar. A model beam with this loading
proved the theory to be correct.
The case of the beam on two supports with an
overhang is a very common problem in aircraft de-
sign. The wing spar of an externally braced mono-
plane is an excellent example. The air loads pro-
duce a uniformly distributed load and due to the
sloping strut bracing of the wing an end load is
also introduced. The load on the overhang pro-
duces a bending moment in the spar so that there
is a point of deflection in the bay which one might
suppose would reduce the length to be considered
in computing the critical load, but tests on a model
prove rather conclusively that this end moment has
no helpful effect and that the critical load is Euler's
critical load for the full length between supports.
In this case the crtical load is independent of the
lateral loading. The end moment and the lateral
loading simply influence whether the spar will
buckle down or up. If the moment due to the over-
hang equals -^ ii' 1- the deflection will be indetermi-
7T"
nate; if it is greater than—K'l., the beam will
buckle up; if it is less it will buckle down. The
value ~ w I- is the end moment of a l&gt;eam fixed at
IT'
one end and hinged at the other and loaded with
lateral and axial loads.
If a wing beam is continuous over three supports
as is the case of a monoplane with a continuous
spar along the whole span or the case of a two bay
biplane, we have another factor entering into con-
sideration. That is the effect of one bay on the
other. If the one bay is much more rigid than the
other because either it is of shorter length or greater
moment of inertia, it is reasonable to expect that
the one bay will lend support to the other. This

possible to exceed Euler's critical load in the less
rigid bay if the end load in the other bay is suffi-
ciently small. However, if Euler's critical load for
each respective bay is reached simultaneously, the
beam will fail.
The models used in this test bore out the theory
that the critical load is independent of the lateral
loading. The tests all indicate that it is dangerous
to design a beam to take more than Euler's critical
load for the full span length under any conditions.

Engineering Smoker
Enjoying its enviable and traditional position in
the realm of engineering social functions, the Engi-
neering Smoker, held April 25 in the Union Ball-
room, presented Samuel S. Wyer, field and con-
sulting engineer from Columbus, Ohio, in a talk.
"The Way Out of the Depression". Mr. Wyer was
introduced by Dean Sadler as a man who exempli-
fied the engineer of the future, the socially-minded
engineer. Mr. Wyer outlined the causes of the
present depression, showing on the numerous
graphs at his disposal, the extent of our fancied
wealth, our approximate actual wealth, and our in-
come for the last thirty years. The area under the
curve representing the fancied wealth was nothing
short of astounding. At the peak of the Coolidge
prosperity it was about equal to our actual wealth.
He included mass production, the selfishness of
some of our capitalists, and credit in the causes of
our present dilemma.
He warned his audience that people must stop
thinking that this is an ordinary cyclic depression.
It is a period of adjustment, he asserted, and added,
that he does not see the end in five or ten years.
Among the contributing factors to a way out. he
lists the realization of the fact that human rights
must take precedence over property rights; that
capital and labor are not independent; that every
man's wages come out of the pocket of somebody
else; and that mass production needs a buying
power. Today, mass production far exceeds the
buying power available. In this respect, he said
that the reduction of wages is not a solution to the
problem. The legal rate of interest on loans must
not exceed 5 per cent, he asserted, and as a means

of enforcement he offers a sixty-day moratorium
on all interest and principal payments, and at the
end of this time, if the interest rates were not low-
ered, the moratorium would be extended to ten
years.
The people must be made to realize that there
is no "Economic Santa Claus", he told those pres-
ent. The attitude of letting the government do it,
has been in part responsible for a daily increase of
$2,000,000 in the aggregate costs of local, state, and
national government, he pointed out. He suggests
a reduction in the budgets of the less essentials.
and not a wholesale slash, irrespective of the de-
partment. He was especially emphatic when he
stated that our school system forms the most im-
portant part of our governmental expenditures, and
that these appropriations should not be curtailed.
He also suggests a combined war and navy depart-
ment. He pointed out that the American Legion,
which constitutes only 1 per cent of the taxpaying
public, is endeavoring to have the government pay
them a cash bonus which would amount to 60 per
cent of the total government expenditures. He in-
dicated that the need of this country is an engineer
who is socially minded, and trained in the human-
ities as well as in material knowledge, to deal with
our future problems. "Science may give a man
power," he said, "but it doesn't give him wisdom".
Mr. Wyer's talk was preceded by a wrestling
match with Art Mosier and Ed Wilson taking part,
and also with a tumbling exhibition by Orin Parker
and Carl Ellsworth. Al Cowan and his band fur-
nished the music. Paul Rauff, '33, officiated as

the new plans in his own car. Since that time all
Chryslers have been designed under Mr. Zeder's
supervision. It was he who designed the hydraulic
brakes first installed in automobiles by Chrysler.
These same brakes, with some improvements, are
standard equipment on Chryslers today, and are a
contributing factor in the company's large sales.
He also made an analysis of quenching processes
for steel and improved the process of heat treat-
ment of steel for automotive parts.
Mr. Zeder is not merely a designer of automo-
biles, but he is also an executive and a business
man. He knows sales psychology and he under-
stands just what the public wants. With this he
combines the financial knowledge so necessary to
a successful business, and he was one of the first
to help take the engineer out of the drafting room
and put him in the executive position.

crasies, in view of the fact that one of them has to
do with music. To begin with, soft dreamy music,
so he calls it, is fatal. However, for the benefit of
those who are not personally acquainted with the
man, it should be explained that his idea of soft
dream music deviates considerably from the usu-
ally accepted notion.
In his junior year he was elected to the position
of editor of the Technic. Scabbard and Blade hon-
ored him by making him a member. The bouquets
didn't stop there. F'i Tau Pi Sigma, Signal Corps
honorary society, also chose to have him in their
ranks.
But by far the greatest honor that was ever be-
stowed upon him was when Miss Irene Tirennals,
of Syracuse, New York, chose to accept him as a
husband. So on May 30, 1932, the happy affair
took place in Syracuse. Unfortunately, the honey-
moon had to be postponed until after the finals.
During that summer, Mr. Seamans, now a man
with a responsibility, toured New England with
his bride.
The fact that Larry, who comes from Colorado,
married a girl from Syracuse is to be explained
thus: He says that his folks used to go to New
York State now and then, and so, in the course of
events he came to know Miss Grennals and .

word", however, by the huge interest it evoked.
does show the response of the people to a plan
other than the one we now work under.) If the
plan be socialistic let it be socialistic. The word
socialism, has without good reason had a bad cono-
tation associated with it. Any scientist, any phil-
osopher, any sociologist, or any thinking person,
writing of a future civilization, pictures a socialistic
state. Why not face the facts and agree to the in-
evitable? We are not advocating the turning over
of government and industry to the Socialists as we
now know them but are asking that the entire
world become more social minded.
Neitzsche's star, which would have no joy in ex-
istence, had it no one to receive its light, has a strik-
ing parallel in our present day civilization. Are we
to glorify a few, forget the group and before much
longer find ourselves and our culture ended in catas-
trophe? Or are we to reconstruct and by carefully
planned methods, pass on to posterity not only our
culture, but the inculcation of a new "ll'ill to Be",
from which will come a bcing which transcends life
as we now know it?

HUTCHINS HALL---
Newest Addition to the Law Quadrangle—Where Engineering
Law Students Complete Their Studies


By Professor O. W. Boston
THERE is a very sensitive relation between the
design, selection of material, and the process of
manufacture of every mechanical device. When a
device or structure is developed for production, the
steps usually followed are:
1. Make sketches or tentative design.
2. Select type of material to he used for each part.
3. Select fabricated form of the material.
4. Determine heat treatment or other conditioning
of the material, and its finish.
5. Make computations for strength and rigidity.
6. Prepare finished manufacturing drawings incor-
porating all features of design, showing dimensions and
tolerances. Models are often made for demonstration
to prove the manufacturing drawing.
7. Prepare complete routing sheet for each part
showing the manufacturing processes in sequence.
The designer today must avail himself, more than
ever before, of new materials and methods of manu-
facture constantly being developed. He must employ
these facilities to meet the highly competitive conditions
existing in every industry.
A survey (Product Engineering. November 1932) of
430 manufacturing companies shows that 330 are en-
gaged in the development of new products in their
present line. Of these developments. 221 are to reduce
the cost of manufacturing. 154 are to increase the num-
ber of styles, and 189 are designed to extend the range
of operation or use of the product.
Factors of design receiving further attention are:
1. Adoption of corrosion-resisting materials
2. More easily replaceable units '--
3. Better lubrication
4. Restyling to give new form . »'.
5. Higher speeds
6. Greater precision in use
7. Closer manufacturing tolerances
8. Better surface finish
The features of design are dependent upon the num-
ber of parts to be made. If one inexpensive device is
to be made, general sketches giving important dimen-
sions may suffice for the builder, leaving the selection
of materials and the choice of tolerances to him. If
many devices are to be made, or only one unit involving
great cost, every care should be given to the selection

of proper material for each part, and all features of
design carefully set forth. These materials are selected
on the basis of physical and chemical properties and
cost. Some properties of major importance are high
strength, hardness, rigidity, lightness, resistance to
wear, resistance to corrosion, resistance to friction,
electrical resistance or conduction, resistance to heat,
machinability, appearance or sales appeal.
In many instances, the material best suited for a
given part is too expensive or too difficult to work so
a compromise may be necessary in favor of a second
or third choice. The engineer should design with the
most recent advances in shop technique in mind in order
to take the fullest advantage of new processes. The
cheapest material actually may involve greater manu-
facturing cost than a more expensive material. For
this reason, free-cutting brass rod often is used in
screw-machine work for making small parts requiring
no appreciable strength, in preference to much less ex-
pensive free-machining steel, as higher cutting speeds
can be used. Low initial cost of the metal does not
necessarily lead to low final cost of the article pro-
duced.
The initial design of a part is prepared usually by
the engineering department of the plant. This design

EDITOR'S NOTE
The Michigan Tcchnic wishes to
thank the following who assisted in
the preparation of this article;
Mr. Stuart B. Dunbar, Director of the
News Bureau of the Golden Gate
Bridge and Highway District,
Mr. George J. Presley, Executive Vice
President of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce,
The Standard Oil Company of Cal-
ifornia.
The Editor.
IN the glorious history of man's conquest of nature a
new chapter is being written.'Determined to match
one of nature's most beautiful works with a man-
made spectacle of grandeur, the architect and the en-
gineer are combining all their
knowledge and skill in a colossal
enterprise. For decades men of
vision have dreamed of a gigantic
span across the Golden Gate. On
the north and east the city of
San Francisco, the gateway of
Pacific commerce, is cut off from
the mainland by the bay waters.
To the west lies the calm Pacific
Ocean. San Francisco, situated as
it is on a peninsula, is virtually
isolated. As the horse-drawn
wagon vanished from the streets
and the motor truck became the
chief means of commercial trans-
portation, as speed and more
speed became the demand of in-
dustry, commerce and transportation, the people of
San Francisco realized that the time had come when the
slow ferryboat must be replaced by a more rapid means
of conveyance. The Golden Gate must be bridged if
the greatest seaport of the west were to fulfill the in-
creasing demands of commerce. The rich dairying re-
gions, the great vineyards, the famous timberlands of
the northern California counties must be made more
easily and more quickly accessible. There must be no
break in the ribbon of the highway stretching north- ,
ward to many important coastal
cities. And now, at last, the dream
of men is rapidly becoming an
actuality as construction of the
mammoth Golden Gate Bridge
progresses.
Architecturally a masterpiece,
the Golden Gate Bridge will be
a monument also to engineering
skill. Between two huge steel
towers, each 125 feet wide at
their bases and rearing them-
selves 740 feet above mean high
water, will swing two great ca-
bles, each 36J/2 inches in diame-
ter and 7649J/2 feet in length.
These great steel sinews, each
weighing 11,000 tons, are made
up of 27,752 separate wires two-tenths of an inch in
diameter. The total length of these wires is 80,000
miles, enough to girdle the earth at the equator more
than three times. These cables will be capable of sup-
porting a load of 430.000.000
pounds. The bridge is designed
to withstand a total possible live
load of 25,400,000 pounds. This
load would be imposed upon the
structure only if the roadway
were packed solidly with vehicles
and the sidewalks with pedestri-
ans.
The clear center span will be
4200 feet between pier centers,
three times the length of the
Brooklyn Bridge and 700 feet
longer than the famous George
Washington Memorial Bridge at
New York, the greatest span
ever built. With its two side spans
of 1125 feet each, the bridge will
have a total length of 6450 feet, as against 4660 feet
for the George Washington Bridge.
The anchorages, in the form of twin blocks, will
each weigh 64,000 tons and each will resist a cable
pull of 63,000,000 pounds.
Ample clearance is provided for the passage of the
world's greatest ships. There will be a vertical clear-
ance of 220 feet at any stage of the tide in the main
channel.
The bridge itself has a width of 90 feet. The roadway

two 10^2 foot sidewalks. The hridge will be capable of
carrying 260,000 automobiles a day.
Independent telephone, fire and police telegraph sys-
tems will be installed and for painting and inspection
there will be a motor-driven traveling platform to ex-
tend the entire span length.
The quantities of materials required are astounding.
The steel, including the cables, amounts to 100,000
tons—enough to load a freight train 20 miles long.
The concrete in the piers, fender and anchorages will
be 254,690 cubic yards—enough to build a solid shaft
25 feet square and two miles high.
It is estimated that during the four year construc-
tion period the bridge will require 9,700,000 man-hours
of work in mills and shops; ^000.000 man-hours in
mines and quarries; 6,600,000, in field work, 5,600,000,
in transportation of materials; 300,000, in cement mills,
and 800.000 in miscellaneous labor. Certainly this project
will be an important factor in the restoration of prosper-
ity not only to the west but also to the other sections of
the country which produce the needed materials.
The total cost of the bridge will be around $32,000.-
000, and it is being financed through a $35,000,000
bond issue authorized in 1930 by the voters of the
Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District. Credit for
the design of this mammoth structure belongs to Joseph
B. Strauss of the Strauss Engineering Corporation.
Rivaling the Golden Gate Bridge project in enormity
and economic importance is the construction of the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Linking the only
two county seats in California not connected with a
primary highway, this bridge will be the one great
avenue of commerce for which the two vast agricultural
valleys to the east of San Francisco have long been
waiting. With a quicker means of transporting pro-
duce from these regions to the markets of the city
will come rapid development and commercial progress.
So widespread will be the benefits of this enterprise
that it is being undertaken not by a local organization
but by the State of California. San Francisco will no

ai Visualized by Its Designer
longer be dependent upon slow ferry service for its
direct traffic with the mainland to the east. With broad
concrete highways leaping to the north and east across
the bay waters the isolation which has hindered the eco-
nomic growth of the Golden Gate metropolis will be
forever ended.
The West Bay Crossing, from San Francisco to
Yerba Buena Island, will be in the form of two sus-
pension bridges having a common anchorage located
midway in the bay. From the Island the bridge will
extend across to the East Bay shore where three feeders
will tap the cities of Berkeley. Oakland and Alameda.
The distance from the San Francisco terminal to the
Island will be 14,650 feet, the Island section will be
2,950 feet, and the section from the Island to the Oak-
land terminal, 25,900 feet for a total length of 43,500
feet, almost 8^4 miles.
The Bay Bridge will be a double deck structure. The
upper deck, 58 feet wide, will accomodate six lanes of
vehicular traffic; the lower deck will carry two inter-
urban tracks and a 31 foot roadway of three lanes for
heavy trucks. About 16,000 vehicles per hour may use
the bridge without congestion. This capacity is about
seven times the present trans-bay traffic handled by the
ferryboats.
In this bridge, as in the Golden Gate Bridge, the
quantities of construction materials are enormous. The
structural and reinforcing steel required, including
that in the 68,950 miles of cable wire and the 43 miles
of suspender ropes, will total 187,000 tons. The cement
necessary will amount to 1,300,000 barrels and 200,-
000 gallons of paint will be used. No timber will be-
come a permanent part of the structure but about
30,000,000 board feet will be utilized in the process of
construction. Certainly the cement plants of California,
the iron mines of Michigan, the steel plants of the
eastern states, and the lumber mills of California,
Washington and Oregon will welcome the demands for
their products and the $78,000,000 which will be ex-
pended on this project in the next four years will not
be a small factor in the economic recovery of the en-
tire country.
Both the Golden Gate and the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay
bridges will be completed early
in 1937 and will be operated as
toll bridges until their respective
earnings are sufficient to retire
the bonds issued to secure build-
ing funds. It is estimated that in
forty years the Golden Gate
Bridge will pay for itself and that
only about half that time will be
required for the Bay Bridge.
Tributes to the perfection of

East Engineering Building
THE Engineering English Collection is at once one
of the most interesting and useful of departments,
and is used by an increasing number of students in
the College of Engineering. Even students from the
other colleges occasionally discover it and find it a use-
ful source for the most recent books of merit. Tucked
away on the third floor of the East Engineering Build-
ing, this unique library caters to those who seek cul-
ture, relaxation or mere companionship in books.
"Great oaks from little acorns grow"—just so has
the collection sprung up from an insignificant begin-
ning, until it now plays an important role in the cul-
tural education of the engineer.
Established some ten years ago, when the staff of
the Engineering English Department saw the need of
modern materials for reading and wanted a range of
selection which textbooks could not offer, the number
of volumes has increased until it now numbers over
one thousand. In the beginning, students in English
classes conducted by the department contributed to
buy a number of books in order to secure a variety of
new and modern material. Soon it was realized that the
students could not furnish the funds for sufficient
books, and the Dean of the Engineering College was
persuaded to grant the English staff a fund for the
purchase of books for the library.
In the selection of new volumes a distinct effort is
made to collect usable things, not only for the moment,
but for the future. Books are selected for their in-
trinsic value and usefulness. When new books are to
be purchased, each meml&gt;er of the English faculty sub-
mits a list of those which in his opinion should be added
to the collection. Because the appropriation rarely cov-
ers the price of all the books asked for, it is necessary
to pare down the lists. In this way only the most use-
ful volumes are purchased.
That the selections meet with the approval of the
students is attested by the worn bindings on most of
the books. Ever since its inception the circulation has
increased month by month, as compared with the same
East Engineering
Library
month a year previous. In the last two years
the circulation has nearly doubled.
The collection grows from year to year,
and it has been much enlarged by voluntary
contributions on the part of the English staff
and the students.
A visit to the library will be quite worth
while. Open stacks invite one to browse.
Because of its favored location, the library is quiet and
conductive to study and reading. A pleasant young
man in attendance is ready to lend a helping hand in
finding any book. Once inside, drawn by the inviting
array, it is hard to leave without one of those books
which everyone is reading.
A glance over the stacks reveals such authors as
Willa Cather, Aldous Huxley, John Galsworthy, W.
Somerset Maugham, H. L. Mencken, Sherwood An-
derson, Eugene O'Neill, J. R. Priestly, Lytton Strachey,
Sigrid Undset, Gabrielle D'Annunzio, James Branch
Cabell, Theodore Dreisser and a host of others. One
feature of the collection is the fact that there are a
number of copies of most of the books, making it
possible to specify a certain book for a course and to
know that it is available. This was the primary purpose
for which the library was established.
For such courses as The Scientific and Technical
Lecture, Public Speaking for Engineers. Contempo-
rary Literature, Contemporary Drama, Contemporary
Novel, The Short Story, The Literature of Science, Literary Masterpieces and other
r- . worth-while courses offered in
the Engineering English Depart-
ment, the library is a veritable
treasure house.
Many books are found there
before they are available any-
where else on the campus. For
instance, Robinson's "The Mind
in the Making" first made its ap-
pearance in this, the "engineer's
library".
Since the primary purpose of
the department is to give the busy
engineering student a certain
amount of cultural background,
with only ten credit hours of
English required, it follows that

With the U of M Gliding Club
THERE is in this country an organization called the
Soaring Society of America, Inc. For the past
four years the society has sponsored Soaring Con-
tests in which the participants in the sport of gliding
vie with one another. This summer there were 72 con-
testants who took part in the Annual Meet held at
Elmira, New York. Four of them were representatives
of the University of Michigan Gliding Club. They were
Stanley S. Smith, now president of the club, N. H.
McDowell, last year's president, Floyd Sweet, and
Prof. R. E. Franklin, formerly of the Engineering
Mechanics Department.
When the meet was over, Stan Smith was the new
National Soaring Champion and the third person to win
the coveted $1500 Edwards S. Evans Trophy, pre-
sented each year to the outstanding pilot of the annual
soaring meet. In addition to that, Smith also won three
prizes in three events. Two altimeters, one for second
place in duration, and another for first place in alti-
tude. The third prize for first place in distance was an
$85 German variometer, an instrument which measures
the rate of climb and fall. Smith's glider was the U. of
M. Club ship, a Franklin utility, designed by Prof.
Franklin.
Floyd Sweet, the youngest member of the Michigan
group, tied for seventh place in points accumulated
during the meet. (The individual records are compiled
on a point basis.) In the special spot landing contest.
Sweet won first place and a variometer given by the
American Askania
Corporation. He also
won a pair of gog-
gles for placing third
in the duration event
for utility gliders. In
each event there
were two classes:
utility gliders, and
sailplanes.
Then to climax it,
the University of
Michigan Club came
back home with the
Sherman F. Fair-
child Trophy for
group endurance.
The local group of
soaring enthusiasts
is the largest univer-
sity gliding club in Stan Smith Taking off in the University Glider at Elmira, N.Y.
the country, and probably the biggest organized soar-
ing club of any sort in the country. Last year there
were 50 members.
Every afternoon of the week and two forenoons, the
novices in the art of gliding—five members at each ses-
sion—go to the Ann Arbor Airport and learn the art of
gliding. The instructors are members who have had
considerable experience. The method is the so-called
auto-tow method. The club glider is towed behind the
club auto which was donated to the club by Edsel Ford
three years ago. A utility glider is one primarily used
for training purposes.
The Gliding Club officers are Stan Smith, '34E,
president, Kenneth McAdam, treasurer. This year's
secretary has not been chosen yet.
Although there were no records broken at the last
meet, due to the poor weather conditions, we under-
stand that it was a success in spite of these difficulties.
The annual contest attracted a number of visitors to
Elmira. The list of the more prominent personalities in
the fields of aviation and meterorology includes Prof.
Carl G. A. Rossby, head of the meterorological de-
partment, M.I.T.; Igor I. Sigorsky, of the Sikorsky
Aviation Corporation; Dan Rochford, managing editor,
the Sportsman magazine; Dr. H. K. Smith, head of the
aerodynamic research division of M.I.T.
Both the Edward S. Evans, and Sherman F. Fair-
child Trophies are to be on exhibit in the lobby of the
East Engineering Building in the near future.

Igniting Pulverized Coal Safely
Igniting Pulverized Coal Safely
Among the many advantages in the use of pulverized
fuel which has-become so widespread, are the high
temperatures which may be attained along with easy
combustion. As a result of these however, igniting pul-
verized coal has in some installations proved some-
what a hazardous job due to the occasional flare-back
through the burner. In one of the New York hotels
such was the case where illuminating gas was used for
igniting the fuel. To light the burners it was necessary
for the operator to stand on an auxiliary platform in
front of the burner and thrust a lighted gas burner into
the furnace through a peep-hole. Because of the re-
stricted space it was difficult for the operator to get
out of the way in case of flare-back, which was usually
the case when relighting a burner during light load
operation.
I. G. Carlsen, boiler room operator, developed the
idea of installing a gas torch permanently in the gas
burner and igniting the gas with an electric spark. The
device consists of a special casing in which are installed
two high tension spark plugs and a butterfly air-inlet
check valve to prevent backfiring of the gas.
As installed, the igniter is operated by lever (A)
which as turned closes the electrical contacts on the
high tension coil and opens a quarter turn in the gas
line. Turning the lever to the full extent turns off the
electric igpition. The inlet check valve is so arranged
that the air supply necessary for burning the gas is
cut off when the draft in the furnace falls below .1
inches. This protects the lighter from back-fire in the
Notes of the
Profession
gas burner and the furnace from explosion due to the
accumulation of combustible fuel. The illustration
shows a typical installation of such a burner.
Besides having the advantage of safety it also saves
an appreciable amount of gas than the original man-
ner of lighting. Moreover, this device can be used
equally well with oil- or gas-fired furnaces. o
Cotton Pads for Curing Concrete
A new use of cotton and a better method of curing
newly laid concrete roads may result from tests com-
pleted recently by the Bureau of Public Roads, U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
Soon after fresh concrete is placed it is necessary
to protect it from the sun which causes rapid drying
of the surface with injury to the concrete. It is cus-
tomary to cover the concrete with a fabric until it has
hardened sufficiently to permit a covering such as wet
earth or one of the various proprietary materials. Bur-
lap, made fronr foreign material, has been widely used
for the early covering.
The tests of the Bureau of Public Roads consisted
of preparing concrete slabs and covering them with
cotton mats, and burlap. One slab was left uncovered.
The mats, which were submitted by the Texas State
Highway Department, consisted of plies of raw cotton
separated by loosely woven cotton cloth. Mats of from
1 ply to 9 plies and from one-third inch to three inches
in thickness were used.
All of the cotton mats appeared to be effective cur-
ing agents and gave better results than burlap. With a
one-ply cotton mat the rise in temperature from early
morning to the hottest part of the day was only 60 per-
cent of that under burlap and about one-third of that
of unprotected concrete.
The bureau has suggested to the State highway de-
partments that they give consideration to the use of
cotton mats for curing at least in an experimental way;
and that, if the cost can be kept within reasonable lim-
its, this method may provide: (1) An improved method
of curing; (2) Protection against damage due to freez-
ing; and, (3) A market for a moderate quantity of
very low grade cotton.
The Bureau of Public Roads in cooperation with the
Bureau of Agricultural Economics and interested State
highway departments is planning to conduct large scale

Diesel-Electric Locomotive Economizes Fuel
A new 800 h.p. diesel-electric locomotive, recently
purchased by the Northampton and Bath, enables trans-
portation to be carried on in the most efficient and eco-
nomical way possible, and in recent tests of three
months endurance, has proven itself much superior to
the older engines.
The locomotive burns a very low cost fuel—-Diesel
fuel—which is practically the same as furnace oil used
in the home. The total cost of the fuel is only $4.00
for an average day's work which is a remarkable figure
considering that it is not unusual for a steam locomo-
tive to burn $15.00 to $20.00 worth in doing the same
work. The diesel electric locomotive is cleaner, can be
worked longer hours, requires no water, and does not
have the familiar tender on the rear for coal and water.
It is not commonly known but the steam locomotive
uses about 7 times as much water as it does fuel.
There is nothing unusually new about this engine
eexcept that it combines the highly efficient diesel with
electrical equipment. The Diesel engine does the same
as the gasoline engine only it is many times larger and
the electrical equipment takes the place of the gear box,
clutch, driveshaft, and differential which are not of
adequate capacity to be used with the great power
required. Two 400 h.p. internal combustion engines de-
velop the power, a dynamo driven directly by the en-
gines changes the power to electricity, cables carry the
electricity to the trucks, and a motor on the truck con-
verts the electricity back to mechanical power to drive
the wheels. As is common in Diesel engines no spark
plugs or ignition device is used since the cylinder is
heated sufficiently while compressing the air to cause
the oil to burn automatically.
The appearance of this new locomotive is much dif-
ferent from those operated by steam. It now appears
as a low coach or car with a raised center compartment.
The center cab gives unobstructed visibility and being
equipped with dual controls provides simple, efficient,
and continuous operation in either direction and from
either side of the cab.
New Circuit Breakers Handle Large Power
The electric lighting plant of 30 or 40 years ago was
protected by open jaw switches and open link fuses.
However with the increase in size of power plants
difficulties were experienced and other devices were
necessary. The development of circuit breakers with
carbon breaks came first and this was followed by the
oil circuit breaker in which the arc caused by opening
the circuit was extinguished in a bath of oil. To cope
with the still increasing voltages, a new principle—the
de-ion principle—was evolved.
It is based on the fact that below a certain voltage
an alternating current will not re-establish, particularly
if the metal contacts from which the arc is drawn are
kept cool, or if the arc is rapidly moved over fresh
cooled metal surface. The new circuit breaker divides
the arc into a number of smaller arcs and by magnetic
means draws these arcs over cold metal surfaces.
Equipment of this nature has been designed from
the smallest household device to the size required for
the greatest power stations in the country. The larger
devices are of more interest to those operating power
stations and transmission lines, but of more importance
to the individual are the household devices. The appli-
cation of these principles has made it possible to design
small units which eliminates the need for fuses and per-
mits the home owner to have positive control of his
circuits at all times, and at the same time gives a degree
of safety hitherto not possible with the older type of
equipment.
Flyers Aided by Powerful Light
Flyers will soon be aided by a new lightweight "eye"
developed in the lighting laboratories of the Westing-
house Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company at Cleve-
land, Ohio.
These new signalling spotlights, of approximately
150,000 candlepower, are now receiving service tests.
These powerful narrow-beam lights rated at 12 volts
will be used as dual-purpose units—the lights may be
used for signalling purposes with the ground at dis-
tances ranging up to five miles and, as a searchlight to
pick up buoys and shore lines from two to three hun-
dred yards distant.
Two bases for the light are installed in each seaplane
so that the observer may mount the unit on either side
of the cockpit. The unit may be kept stored in a com-
partment except when needed. Kept connected to the
current supply, the observer needs only to slip it out
of its compartment and place it on its base, to have it
ready for service.
The signalling shutter mounts directly on the front
of the unit and is operated by a small hand trigger cap-
able of blinking the light at extremely high speed, for
code signalling to the ground, where no radio communi-
cation is available.

0. W. Boston in Detroit
Prof. O. W. Boston, Director of the Engineering
Shops, and W. W. Gilbert, research fellow in metal-
lurgy, presented a paper on "The Life of Turning
Tools as Influenced by Shape" on October 3 to the
National Metal Congress which convened in Detroit.
The paper, according to Prof. Boston, shows that the
different results obtained by different investigators
on the relation between cutting speed and tool life can-
not be compared because the experiments have been
carried out under different conditions. The authors of
the paper introduced certain variables of the tool for
a given set of conditions of cutting and show definitely
that these variables do account for the differences ob-
tained by other investigators.
The paper proper was read by Prof. Boston and Mr.
Gilbert gave the closure after discussion and questions
from the floor had been presented. W. W. Gilbert is
a graduate of the University of Colorado, received his
Master's degree here, and is now working for his Doc-
tor's degree.
The National Metal Congress held at the same time
as the National Metal Exposition is sponsored by the
American Society for Steel Treating. The exposition
is the largest exposition of its kind held annually in
this country. Among the exhibits were three dyno-
mometers which were developed in the shops here. One
of the dynomometers measures the three components
of the cutting force. Another for the measurement of
one component of the cutting force in shapers, planers,
etc. The last machine was a brand new one used to
measure torque and thrust for testing drills, cutting
fluids, bearings, and lubricants.

Notes
A I. Ch. E.
The Student Branch of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers got a running start over the other
student branches of professional societies (here on the
campus) by being the first to meet this fall. The chemi-
cal engineers met September 28 in the Chapter rooms
in the East Engineering building to hear an address
by Prof. A. H. White, head of the Chemical Engineer-
ing Department.
Prof. White began his talk on "Opportunities for
Chemical Engineers" by a short history of engineering.
He related how the American Chemical Engineer had
to struggle with German competition before the World
War. After the War, however, the American Chemical
Engineering Association having increased almost nine
times its original size, and German patents being Con-
fiscated, the American chemical industry was firmly
established.
Prof. White then spoke of the various opportunities
for chemical engineers today, and added that of the
graduates in chemical engineering from this university,
never have more than five per cent been out of employ-
ment.

Triangles
Triangles, junior engineering honorary society, at
its first meeting on October 1, elected Phil Singleton,
president, Joseph Wagner, secretary, and Martin Mor-
tenson, treasurer.
The meeting was called by Phil Singleton who had
been elected temporary chairman over the summer
recess.
The retiring president, supervised the election of the
new president and made a few recommendations to
the members.
It was decided to meet every two weeks. Plans were
also discussed for a project to be undertaken by the
society during the coming year. It will be remembered
that Triangles was influential in the adoption of the
present system of classification in the Engineering
College.

THANK YOU
It seems to be human nature for a person to complain
when things do not suit him but when things are to
his liking, instead of complimenting those responsible
for this grand state of affairs, he maintains an un-
broken silence. We should like to be a bit different
and offer a hearty "Thank you" to the Legislators, Re-
gents, President Ruthven and whoever else is responsi-
ble for the tuition rate being kept at its old level.
We are attending one of the greatest universities in
the country and comparatively our tuition rates are
very small, which only makes the accomplishment the
greater. The method of paying tuition by semesters
was also a happy thought, one of great importance to
many students.
So again. Thank You.
of the Engineering Students, the Regents turned the
plan down when it was brought before them for ap-
proval. And that, fellow engineers, is that!
YOUR MAGAZINE
By way of starting the year off right, we are remind-
ing the student body of the Engineering College that
The Technic is their magazine. We hope that you will
all show an interest in the material making up the
magazine and of the make-up of the magazine itself.
Do you have a preference as to the type of articles
printed? Do you like the various departments in their
present form? Is the magazine illustrated to suit your
taste? Do you favor a highly technical article to a
general engineering article? And a host of other ques-
tions could be asked.
We are also interested in obtaining student articles
or notes. If you feel that you have a subject that would
be of interest to the student body, drop in on the Edi-
tors and they will be glad to consult with you as to the
advisability of printing an article on it. If you have
any suggestions or criticisms to offer, stop by at the
office and talk them over.
Make The Technic your magazine.
THE PETITION
The Editors have been questioned so many times
as to the status of the petition which was circulated last
semester, proposing the incorporation of the subscrip-
tion price of The Technic in the Engineering Student's
tuition, that we thought it advisable to print the result
of our efforts. Although the Staff of the magazine suc-
ceeded in getting the signatures of over ninety percent
THE STUDENT AND THE NRA
Many eventful things have taken place during the
past few months of which the most notable is the NRA.
This great program in addition to aiding business re-
covery is emancipating the human being from the
drudgery of long hours of work. Does the college stu-
dent get a break in this new deal?
The general opinion among people is that the student
always did have a break. Even some professors believe
that the students have plenty of time to do their work
with lots of time to spare. Any student, especially one
in a professional school, is well aware of the contrary.
Let us look into the working week of an engineering
student. First, the student must carry eighteen hours
of work a semester to graduate in four years. According
to the formula, one hour in class should be accompanied
by two hours of preparation. This means that, three
times eighteen or fifty-four hours of concentration on
studies is suggested. Every engineering student knows
of two hour courses and certain laboratory and drawing
courses that do not follow this rule. However, to avert
argument let us say that fifty-four hours is all that
is necessary for the average student to remain in the
upper half of his class. The student to round out his
education is urged to participate in outside activities
which consume at least six hours a week. That makes
a total of sixty hours or a twelve hour five day week.
It must be remembered that all this work is mental
work which is just as tiring if not more so than physical
labor. In addition to this the student must find time for
lectures, concerts, athletic recreation and events, bull
sessions and social life all of which is necessary for a
well balanced education. Where is the NRA code for
the student?
Let us assume that the student does have a great
deal of leisure time how much time would he have for
himself if he did every day all that the manicures say
he ought to do to his hands, all that the barbers say he
ought to do to his hair, all that the tailors say he ought
to do to his clothes, all that the doctors say he ought
to do for his health, all that the physical instructors
say he ought to do to his muscles, and all that the
preachers say he ought to do to his soul.

RESOLUTIONS
I've made a resolution firm
To quit my lazy ways.
I'm going to work like hell this term
I'm going to get some A's.
I'm going to do my best to rate
A flock of honoraries.
I'm determined to accumulate
A watch chain full of keys.
Nothing can my purpose sway.
Tomorrow work will be my fate.
"Why not tonight?" my friend you say?
Er—well you see I've got a date.

The visitor was being shown through the insane
asylum. In one ward he came upon a man who walked
incessantly back and forth, asking everyone whom he
met for a piece of toast.
"My good man," inquired the visitor, "why do you
keep walking around, and what do you want with a
piece of toast?"
"Why, can't you see?" replied the inmate in a sur-
prised tone, "I'm a poached egg and I'm looking for a
place to sit down."
The engineer, modest and diffident, approached Saint
Peter. "1 am looking for a job," he said.
"What on earth do you do?" asked Saint Peter.
The engineer replied calmly, "I apply mathematical
principles to the control of natural forces."
"You can go to hell with your mathematical princi-
ples," said Saint Peter.
Whereupon the engineer departed for the Nether
Regions.
But pretty soon strange reports began to reach Saint
Peter and many of his guests asked for transfers. So
Saint Peter sent one of his private operators to investi-
gate and he came back with the following report:
"That engineer you sent down there," he said "has
completely transformed the place so that you would
not know it now. He has harnessed the Fiery Furnaces
for light and power. He has cooled the entire place with
artificial refrigeration. He has drained the Lakes of
Brimstone and has filled the air with cool perfumed
breezes. He has swung bridges across the Bottomless
Abyss and has bored tunnels through the Obsidian
Cliff. He has created paved streets, gardens, parks and
playgrounds, lakes, rivers and beautiful waterfalls.
That engineer has simply gone through hell but he has
made of it a realm of happiness, peace and industry."

It was in a freshman rhetoric class. The professor
was engaged in a rather lengthy and a rather involved
explanation of a grammatical construction and as he
proceeded he noticed a hand waving impatiently from
one of the rear rows. He pretended not to see it and
continued his lecture. The hand continued to wave
with a persistence that would not be denied until at
last, his patience exhausted, the professor angrily de-
manded, "Well, what is it?"
"Please sir," asked a timid voice, "may I leave the
room?"
"Yes," snapped the professor, and then added, "And
you'd better hurry."

jected to meet physical or chemical requirements, vari-
ous features of design which influence the use of
machine tools available or to l&gt;e purchased, features
of design which influence the design of jigs, fixtures,
and cutting tools in production, and practical manu-
facturing tolerances on dimensions.
Detail and assembly drawings are finally prepared
in which all features of design, including necessary
mathematical calculations or practical considerations
for convenience of manufacture are incorporated. The
detail drawings of each part are made to show all
dimensions, allowances, tolerances, and other instruc-
tions necessary for its careful manufacture.
There are a great many materials from which selec-
tion can be made for a given design. Several may be
equally suitable. Most of these materials are fabricated
for use into convenient forms. Sheets, strips, bars, and
extruded shapes are made of most metals in many con-
venient sizes and to accurate dimensions.
When the quantity of parts to be produced is small,
they may be machined from solid stock or built up from
sheet, tube, and bar stock, joined together by various
methods, such as riveting, welding, brazing, and solder-
ing. Above a certain quantity, these methods of con-
struction become prohibitive due to expense, and
production processes of casting, forging, and stamping
are employed. To illustrate, one part may be machined
from solid stock or built up at a cost of $10. If ten of
these parts are required, it may be worth while first to
make a wood pattern at a cost of $30, from which ten
green-sand castings can be made at a cost of $5. Sub-
sequent light machining operations may cost an added
$25, making the final cost per piece $6. However, if
one hundred pieces are required, a good metal pattern
can be made, costing more than the wood pattern, but
when pro rated over 100 pieces costing less per piece.
Refinement in the machine tool set-up would reduce
the unit cost of machining, while the material cost per
piece would remain the same. The result is that each
of the 100 pieces costs less than one of the ten. If
greater quantities are required, other fabricating proc-
esses, such as forging, stamping, or die casting, may be
found to reduce the material cost -and reduce some of
the machining formerly required.
Forgings from dies are limited to more or less simple
shapes of comparatively small sizes not exceeding two
or three hundred pounds, while castings of any metal
can be made in almost any size and in simple or com-
plicated shapes. Casting must be resorted to when ex-
tremely complicated shapes are to be produced. Metal
can be poured into green-sand molds, dry-sand cores,
or permanent metal molds to suit the size and shape of
the work and as indicated by the quantity required. Die
castings are limited to low-melting-point metals, such
as lead, tin, zinc, aluminum, and their alloys, and brass,
but are made in limited sizes of about 20 inches in
length up to about 20 pounds limiting weight. The
liquid metal is forced under pressure in metal molds.
Dimensions of die castings can be held to within 0.001
inch per inch of length. Holes can be cored, threads
cast, and smooth surfaces provided so that little, if any,
machining is required to prepare the casting for use.
Light polishing only is necessary l&gt;efore plating.
When the final engineering or manufacturing draw-
ing of a device is finished, a bill of material is prepared.
It is usually summarized on an assembly drawing, al-
though the detailed drawing of each part gives the
information on the material for that part. This bill
lists the number and name of all parts as numbered
on the assembly drawing, the number of each unit
needed in the assembly, as well as the type and fabri-
cated form of the material of which that part is to be
made.
It is seen from the above that, before the design and
bill of material is satisfactorily completed, great care
must be given to the selection of the material of which
each part is to be made, and its fabricated form. The
fabricated form of the material indicates, in most in-
stances, the type of machining process to be carried out
in manufacture.
An illustration of the selection of proper material for
making a simple screw in a hand or automatic screw
machine from bar stock in which the free-machining
properties are balanced against high physical proper-
ties, follows:
1. Free-cutting brass rod, very free machining, very
low strength.
2. S.A.E. 1112 steel rod, free machining, low
. strength.
3. S.A.E. 1120 steel rod. slightly less free machining,
medium strength.
4. S.A.E. 1020 steel rood, good machining, medium
strength.
5. S.A.E. 1360 steel rod, fairly good machining, high
strength.
6. S.A.E. 6150 steel rod. poor machining, very high
strength.

which the machine he is designing is to be made, but
rather copies a previously built machine similar in gen-
eral desgn and purpose, in which, by the cut and try
method, unsuitable and expensive materials have been
eliminated. If parts of brittle cast iron are found to
break repeatedly, they are replaced by ductile malleable
cast iron or high-strength steel forgings or castings.
Weight imposes limitations, and rigidity is of great
importance. The designer of heavy machine tools, roll-
ing mills, etc., is more interested in rigidity than he is
in saving weight. Therefore, cast iron, cast steel, and
plain carbon forgings are commonly used. Where the
machine involves high speeds and high power, alloy
steels are introduced for gears, shafts, etc. The beds of
machine tools, the frames of electric motors, and many
like devices are made of heavy cast iron pieces or they
may be built up from structural shapes and sheets by
the process of riveting or welding. Welding is gaining
in favor as a substitute for riveting. High-pressure
tanks, ships, bridges and buildings, machine tools, and
jigs and fixtures are being constructed of welded
sheets, plates, and structural shapes of steel.
Low cost, ease of producing complicated shapes, low
shrinkage, machinability, and good wearing qualities
recommend cast iron. It is usually selected for cylinders
for engines and compressors, because of its good wear-
ing qualities. Cast iron is produced in many ways and
in many grades. The International Nickel Company
recommends a total of fifty alloys of nickel or nickel
and chromium for specific uses. Molybdenum, vanadi-
um, titanium, and other alloying elements also are used
advantageously. Where greater ductility is required,
malleable cast iron is used. Cast steel is substituted
where a greater strength material is required or where
lower weight is essential. Steel forgings for parts of
comparatively simple shapes and limited weight are used
to replace steel castings. These forgings, containing
various alloying elements when properly heat treated,
furnish desirable physical properties.
The designer of automobiles and airplanes is inter-
ested in high strength-weight ratio and, therefore, uses
high-strength alloy steel heat treated, high-strength
light alloys of aluminum and magnesium, and, where
possible, sheet steel formed to the desired shape. Large
parts are built up of sheet steel by riveting or welding.
Forgings of steel are used where practicable instead of
castings. Cast iron is replaced by the stronger and more
ductile steel castings, except for use as cylinder blocks
or pistons.
Additional materials used in aircraft construction are
canvas, linen, silk, leather, wood, plywood, glues, and
sound-deadening and heat insulating compositions. Air-
plane ribs and wings may be made up of nailed and
glued wood structures, riveted aluminum alloy shapes,
or more recently of shot-welded stainless steel shapes.
The fuselage and landing gear are usually made up of
welded steel tubing, with the highly-stressed members

of chromium-molybdenum steel, while the lower-
stressed tubes are of plain medium carbon. Sometimes
riveted duralumin is used, as in the Ford plane. Gaso-
line tanks are made of welded pure aluminum sheet.
A 1-inch plug will not, under ordinary conditions,
fit into a 1-inch diameter hole. This condition is called
a snug fit with zero allowance. For this reason, a cer-
tain allowance is specified which permits this assembly.
It is large or small, depending upon the closeness of
the fit involved. Such allowances are classified by the
American Standards Association into eight classes,
from a loose fit, class 1, to a heavy force and a shrink
fit, class 8. That is, the 1-inch hole would be dimen-
sioned 1 inch in diameter, while the 1-inch plug would
be dimensioned 0.998 inch in diameter, if the allowance
is to be 0.002 inch. Inasmuch as it is absolutely im-
possible to manufacture the hole to a diameter of
1-inch, tolerances or leeways in dimensions are pro-
vided. Thus, the hole would be dimensioned on the
detail drawing as 1.000 inch +0.002 and —0.000
inch for a plus tolerance of 0.002 inch. The plug, on
the other hand, would be dimensioned 0.998 inch
+0.000 and —0.001 inch for a negative tolerance of
0.001 inch.
Therefore, the minimum difference in size (allow-
ance) is 0.002 inch, while the maximum variation in
size is 0.005 inch. These variations must be decided
upon before a proper method of manufacture can be

cases should be as large as possible, because the ex-
pense of manufacture mounts rapidly as tolerances are
decreased. Many drawings call for producing a part
accurate to 0.0001 inch. Such accuracy involves very
expensive shop equipment, considerable additional pro-
ductive labor, and also great care in inspection as con-
trasted with more lenient specifications.
The bill of material for the complete device shows
the type and amount of material required for all parts.
This is used in estimating cost and purchasing. The
next step in manufacture is to prepare routings for each
part. Each routing shows all operations on a piece,
arranged in sequence. The specific types of machines
and tools are listed for each operation, together with
all operating conditions required for rate setting. Spe-
cial measuring devices for inspection and manufactur-
ing accessories are also listed.
The various operations are governed by the type of
equipment already available or to be purchased and by
the fabricated form of the material for the part. There
are often several ways in which a part may be made.
The most efficient manufacturing method should be
selected.
The factor leading to the method finally selected is
usually one of cost and convenience as to the plant and
equipment available. The list of operations and equip-
ment, based on the final manufacturing drawings, as
summarized on the routing sheet, serves as a guide in
laying out the equipment in order that the flow of
material through the plant may be accomplished eco-
nomically. This design and routing should be as final
as humanly possible before material is ordered and
production started.
This final form, however, cannot remain final for
long. Conditions are ever changing and must be met
by the engineer. Great sums of money are constantly
being expended in large plants to introduce new mate-
rials, new fabricated forms, or new manufacturing
equipment to effect economies. Particularly, do small
savings on each part manufactured in quantities yield
profitable results. As one example, the transmitter
face plate of the desk telephone, previously prepared
for machining from sheet brass by eight die operations
in a press, was made by a new process of hot forging
brass at a saving of a couple ce'nts each. The produc-
tion of thousands of these pieces each day throughout
the year resulted in a saving of many thousands of
dollars which justified the cost of the change.

A.S.M. E.
The student branch of the American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers held its first regular bi-monthly
meeting with an informal smoker, on October 4th at
the Michigan Union.
The meeting proper was taken up purely with affairs
of business, plans for showing of motion pictures deal-
ing with different phases of industry and for trips to
different industrial plants being discussed. The meeting
was presided over by Frederick S. Kohl, '34E, president
of the student branch.
An informal get-together followed the meeting dur-
ing which Henry C. Anderson pictured mechanical en-
gineering and the life of the mechanical engineer a
decade ago.
A unique feature of the student branch of the
A.S.M.E. is that membership is not limited to en-
gineers alone, so that everyone professing interest in
the various phasefls of mechanical engineering may
become a member. The subjects that are discussed at
the meetings are of a non-technical as well as of a
technical nature, therefore being of interest to all.
The student branch through its regular bi-monthly
meetings hopes to become more closely knit with the
professional A.S.M.E.

Major Chester L. Fordney, '17E, has been preparing
for some weeks to accompany Lt.-Commander T. G.
Settle on his second attempt for a flight to the stratos-
phere. It will he remembered that the first attempt,
from the grounds of the World's Fair at Chicago, met
with ill fortune when one of the hydrogen valves mis-
behaved.
This flight is of interest to Michigan men in more
ways than one. The all metal gondola in which will be
the two men and the numerous delicate scientific instru-
ments was designed from specifications of Prof. Aug-
ust Picard, the Frenchman wha has made two previous
flights, and it was executed at the plant of the Dow
Chemical Company at Midland, Michigan. Mr. Willard
Dow, the president is also an ahimnus of the University.
Since the previous record set by Prof. Picard has so
recently been broken by the Soviet flyers, Major Ford-
ney and Commander Settle will be forced to the limit
to bring a new record to this country.
We wish them Godspeed!
Such is the service of the Red Cross, in which the
youth of the college world are invited to participate, for
in announcing its annual Roll Call to the colleges of
the country, the American Red Cross is assured of a
cooperation not limited to the contribution of funds for
the continuance of its activities, but inclusive of a self-
dedication as well.
The Challenge of the Red Cross Roll Call
Today, as never before, the nation needs the en-
lightenment and direction that the college-trained man
and woman can give. Leadership is the legitimate heri-
tage of education; the power of knowledge is incal-
culable. But knowledge, unillumined by idealism, may
be only the means of filling the dreary vacuum of self
with materialistic and trivial absorptions. Hope of solu-
tion of world-wide problems must come through
spiritual awareness and ardor. And in the bright realms
of youth these qualities are spontaneous and abundant.
In the months that lie ahead responsibilities of vary-
ing kind and degree await the continued ministrations
of the Red Cross. Due to drastic changes in legislation
affecting Federal benefits to veterans, it is inevitable
that the organization which by the terms of its charter
is charged with the duty of serving those who wear or
have worn the uniform of Uncle Sam should find its
tasks greatly augmented. Disaster relief is the foremost
obligation of the American Red Cross. Last year, it
took the helm in 96 disasters ranging the breadth of
the country.
The Volunteer Service of the Red Cross offers a
wide scope of opportunities for helpfulness in its pro-
duction, surgical dressings, canteen and motor corps
divisions. Those who have served apprenticeship in
any of these fields of usefulness find a ready place in
time of major disasters when every resource in the
stricken area is channeled through the Red Cross. For
those who desire to qualify by special preparation for
work rich in human appeal, there is Braille transcribing
for the blind, hospital service, staff assistance and duty
as health aides.
Alumnus Publishes Book
Dean W. Taylor, '16E, Power Sales Supervisor.
Utility Management Corporation, New York City, is
the author of a new and unusual book entitled "Power
Sales" which was written in July and has just been
released by the McGraw-Hill Book Co. of New York.
The book is unusual in that it is the first book ever
published which has been devoted entirely to the sub-
ject of fundamentals and practical methods of selling
power to industry. Largely to clarify his own ideas,
the author first set down and later published in Elec-
trical H'orld several articles suggestive of methods
which had proved effective under the new conditions
due to the increasing importance of utility service and
selling competition.
When the articles were well received, the author
collected and amplified them, with the result that
"Power Sales" is now available as a valuable handbook
for the power salesman, containing a wealth of prac-
tical suggestion and guidance. The book is modern and
up-to-the-minute, and takes up in detail the various
phases of competition and sales resistance met with in
this field.
Aeros—Notice
During recent months we have been fortunate in
securing some unusual illustrations of airplanes for
publication in the Technic. Among them are the frontis-
piece "Homing" in the January issue, and the "Gee-
Bee" Model in the May issue.
These illustrations have been loaned through the
courtesy of The Sportsman Pilot, a magazine published
in the interests of the airminded sportsman. Through-
out the magazine one finds such unusual and interest-
ing pictures as those we have used. If it were not for
the fact that we cannot be partial to any one field of
engineering many more of them would appear.
Some of the photographs are very suitable for
framing. P,ecause of this, we are passing along a bit
of information. It has come to our attention that it is
possible to obtain fine reproductions of any of these
illustrations, on order, for the nominal fee of one
dollar each. They may be secured by writing to the
Editor, The Sportsman Pilot, 515 Madison Avenue.

Temperature Control
By C. C. Monrad, Grad.
MANY attempts have been made during the past
few years to find a suitable method of pro-
ducing and controlling temperatures in the
range between that possible with steam and with hot
furnace gases, i.e.. 400 F. to
800°F.
The critical temperature of
steam (temperature above which
no pressure will condense the
vapor) is around 690°F., and the
corresponding pressure is 2860
Ibs. per sq. in. Boilers are in
operation at present up to 1400
lb. per sq. in. in large central
stations, but these must be very
carefully designed and the cost
is very great. For this reason
most commercial plants do not
desire to use much over 150 lb.
per sq. in. in their steam lines,
as the installation cost increases
rapidly above this pressure.
It might be thought possible to use superheated steam
at low pressures to obtain the desired temperatures, but
a careful study of the problem shows that this is not
feasible. It has been recognized for over fifty years
that the main resistance to heat flow from a metal wall
to a moving fluid (generally turbulent) is that of a
very thin film of fluid at the wall which is in viscous
motion and through which the heat must pass by pure
conduction. Thus if heat passes from one fluid to an-
other through a metal wall it must pass by conduction
through one film, then through the wall, and finally
through the second film, from which it is removed by
convection currents in the main stream. Although these
films are extremely thin, the thermal conductivity of
most fluids is so low that the major resistance to the
heat flow is found in these films. In most cases the
resistance of the wall is negligible since the thermal
conductivity of metals is very high. This fact has not
been recognized universally until rather recently, and
in fact even now some investigators wonder why the
use of a copper tube instead of an iron one in a con-
denser does not have an appreciable effect on the heat
transfer, since copper has a greater thermal conduc-
tivity than iron.
In general, therefore, there are three resistances to
the flow of heat from one fluid to another. These re-
EDITOR'S NOTE
The control of steam and hot furnace
gases has for some time perplexed the en-
gineer. In this article the author has given
a concise review of the problems connected
with the subject and presented an account
of the latest accomplishments in this field.
The substituting of new materiils ,:s heaN
ing mediums appears to offer a suitable
solution of the difficulties. The discussion
of the feasibility of diphenyl should prove
of great interest to engineers in all fields
of work.
—The Editor.
sistances act very similarly to those in an electric cir-
cuit and may be handled by the same general methods
in calculation. The available temperature difference is
equivalent to the voltage, the heat flowing to the am-
perage, etc. Thus, if one of the
resistances in series is very high,
all. or practically all, of the tem-
perature difference is across it.
With a given temperature differ-
ence over all the resistances, an
amount of heat will flow corre-
sponding to the total resistance,
and the temperature difference
will be divided inversely pro-
portional to the resistances. In
most cases it is customary to
evaluate the reciprocal of the re-
sistance, or the conductance,
which is called the heat transfer
coefficient. In English units this
coefficient is defined as the num-
ber of B.T.U.'s passing through a square foot of sur-
face in one hour with a temperature difference of one
degree Fahrenheit.
The heat transfer coefficient varies greatly according
to the type and properties of the fluids or other sub-
stances used, but some idea of the values to be expected
may be obtained from the following.
(1) Condensing steam to metal wall 1500 to 3000
(2) Hot gas to metal wall 2 to 50
(3) Superheated steam to metal wall 2 to 50
(4) Wall to non-boiling liquid 25 to 500
(5) Wall to boiling liquid 100to 1500
The high values found in the case of condensing
steam is due to the fact that the entire resistance is due
to the film of condensate, which drains by gravity
very quickly. All the other cases involve much thicker
films of fluid. If the coefficient is calculated for a one-
eighth inch copper wall it is found to be equal to the
thermal conductivity divided by the thickness or:
220"x 12X8 = 21120
It is apparent that if heat is being carried from
condensing steam to a gas through a copper wall the
resistances of both the steam and the wall may be ne-
glected, and the entire resistance assumed to be that
of the gas film. The same assumption may be made in
the case of a liquid being heated or boiled with steam,
although in this case the assumption is not as valid.

A view of the circulating system of the diphenyl boiler
If, however, superheated steam is used to heat a
liquid the reverse is true if the vapor does not con-
dense, and the major resistance is that of the steam
film. The amount of heat flowing is very much less
than when steam is condensing, and the amount of
surface required is correspondingly greater, resulting
in greater initial cost of equipment. In addition, only
the specific heat of the steam is available, and this is
so low that the vapor changes very greatly in tempera-
ture, and the desired control of temperature is lost.
With condensing steam the temperature control is very
good, since it condenses at constant temperature, giving
up only the latent heat of vaporization.
In the same way the use of a hot gas for heating a
liquid means usually that the surface must he much
larger than when condensing steam is used, unless the
gas is extremely hot. If too great temperature differ-
ences are used local overheating often takes place, and
in many cases the product is spoiled.
At present many plants use a rather high-boiling
oil which is heated and circulated past the desired heat-
ing surface. The only heat given up by the oil is the
specific heat and the oil changes greatly in temperature
from one end to the other of the apparatus. The co-
efficient of heat transfer from the oil is rather low.
the power costs high, and the temperature control poor.
Electric heating is used to a large extent in certain
parts of the country, when very accurate control of
temperature is desired, but this method is too expensive
for general use.
Since condensing steam gave such very high heat
transfer coefficients and accurate control temperature.
it was obvious that other vapors should be sought which
might be used for the higher temperatures. This vapor
had to give a temperature of about 750° at 100 or 200
lbs. per sq. in. pressure, and in addition had to be fluid,
stable, and cheap. These requirements were very hard
to meet for a long time and it is only recently that such
a vapor has been found.
One of the first fluids to occur to one's mind would
no doubt be mercury. This is liquid at ordinary tem-
peratures, is very fluid, boils around 671 °F at atmos-
pheric pressure, and is very stable in the absence of
air. However, experience with it in power cycles has
shown that the vapor is very poisonous, difficult to
hold in an apparatus, is limited in supply and expen-
sive. There appears to be little use in considering it as
a possibility except under very particular conditions.
Organic fluids of high molecular weight appear to
offer the most advantages at the present time. There
are innumerable substances of this class, of course, but
the choice is narrowed down to alxmt three that have
most of the properties necessary. Diphenyl. diphenyl
oxide and naphthalene seem to meet most of the re-
quirements fairly well. The boiling points of all three
are such that a temperature of about 700"F may be
obtained with a pressure of 100 lbs. per sq. in. Ap-
parently diphenyl is the most stable of the three up to
800 F. and tests made at this temperature for several
months showed practically no decomposition. Diphenyl
oxide has the doubtful advantage of a low melting
point, but is probably not as stable as diphenyl. Naph-
thalene tends to sublime rather badly, in addition to
being rather unstable.
At the present it appears that diphenyl has all the
requirements and very few, if any, disadvantages. It
is fluid, high-boiling, stable, has a fairly high latent
heat, and is relatively cheap and abundant. The only
possible disadvantage is the fact that it melts at 159°F.
and must be kept above this temperature at all times
in order to prevent solidification. This is not very
difficult to do, however, and the possible inconvenience
is offset by the fact that a centrifugal pump may be
used to pump it at high pressures. This is accomplished
by using a water cooled stuffing gland on the pump,
which freezes the diphenyl in the packing, and prevents
leaks.
A general idea of the properties of diphenyl may be
obtained from the following table:

E. C. M. A. Convention
By Stanley C.
THIRTEEN is supposed to be an unlucky num-
ber but it presented no difficulties to the fifty
to sixty delegates who attended the thirteenth an-
nual convention of the Engineering College Magazines
Associated, more familiarly known as the E.C.M.A.
Twenty-one member magazines (listed on the contents
page of this issue) make up the association and a varied
geographical lot they are. The convention took place
at Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wis. on October
16 and 17, and attracted delegates from Philadelphia
in the East to Oregon in the West. The Technic was
represented by the three members of the Publication
Board.
Organized in 1920 and dedicating itself to the ad-
vancement of engineering college journalism and the
adoption of standards of practice, the E.C.M.A. has
grown steadily and now commands a unique position
in the collegiate world. At this thirteenth convention,
two of the men who helped found the association were
among those present—namely, Professor L. F. Van
Hagen, of the University of Wisconsin and "Bill"
Merrihue, for four years Chairman and still very ac-
tive in the councils of the group. So anxious are they
both for the welfare of this organization, that they
engaged in several verbal clashes on the convention
floor, helping to enliven an already much alive gather-
ing-
Conventions are usually thought of as convenient
places to do nothing else but have a good time but this
one certainly was an exception, though good times were
not lacking. Chairman Robley Winfrey of Iowa State
College opened the convention on time to the minute
and the first morning session was turned over to Cir-
culation, a round table discussion, led by Vice-Chair-
man Richard W. Beckman. A good part of this time
was devoted to the blanket-tax, the practice of includ-
ing the subscription price of the magazine in the stu-
dent's tuition. Many schools in the E.C.M.A. use this
method but The Technic had an adverse report to make
on its attempt to institute this system.
The afternoon of the first day was devoted entirely
to the business end of the magazines with Honorary
Chairman Willard H. Merrihue leading the discussion
on advertising and Vice-Chairman Allen G. Stimson
presiding over the records and accounts debates. The
boys are still smiling over Mr. Merrihue's graphic
descriptions of how to secure advertising. His advice
Killian. '34E
was sound, even if a bit humorous and the delegates all
found something worthwhile in his talk. Mr. Stimson's
report and discussions were of a more routine nature
but he did force a concensus of opinion on his new
uniform accounting system. This system has been
adopted by practically all the "mags" and they find
it highly desirable. It should not be supposed that the
Chairman of each of these sessions does all the talking.
The boys mix in continually and sometimes the argu-
ments grow so heated that only the Chairman's gavel
restores order among several who insist on speaking
at once. Probably the greatest enjoyments and benefits
come from just such a willingness of the various dele-
gates to argue and present their own views, even
against heavy opposition.
The morning of the second day was allotted to edi-
torial criticism and discussion. This was led by Vice-
Chairman Leonard II. Church of the McGraw-Hill
Publishing Company. Lively debates took place on a
number of editorial practices, including the make-up of

By Prof. W. C. Sadler
GOVERNMENTS are conceived with the primary
purpose of advancing the public welfare. With
the passage of time a government Ixecomes
more powerful, due to its expanding activities; and
this very expansion may lead eventually to the intrusion
upon the individual rights of its citizens. As a pro-
tective measure, therefore, constitutional guaranties are
developed to limit these arbitrary powers of the gov-
ernment.
An early, although not the first, limitation of this
nature appears in the Magna Charta of June 15. 1215,
in which Chapter 39 provides a protection of the life,
liberty and property of freemen through the "lawful
judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land".
This same principle of limitation of governmental pow-
ers is carried down through the Federal and State con-
stitutions of our country. The Fifth Amendment to
the Federal Constitution protects the life, liberty and
property of the citizens against his federal government.
In the beginning, the citizen was protected against his
state government through the state constitution; after
the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment to the Fed-
eral Constitution was passed, forbidding the respective
states to intrude upon the individual rights of their
citizens. It should be noted that both the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution

Law must always be considered on construction jobs
guarantee the life, liberty and property of the citizens
as determined by the due process of law. Attorney
Daniel Webster gave the following definition of due
process of law in the famous case of Dartmouth Col-
lege vs. Woodward, 4 L.ed. 629, wherein he said "by
the law of the land is most clearly indicated the general
law; a law which hears before it condemns; which pro-
ceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after
trial". This definition clearly brings out a necessity for
a notice to the accused, an opportunity for a hearing,
and a regularly constituted preceding. It should be
noted that both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments
to the Federal Constitution provide protection against
state and federal governments, and not against the
individual, as established in the case of U.S. vs. Cruik-
shank. 92 U.S. 542, 554.
It is important to understand the term properly as
used in connection with the due process clause. It is
evident that the taking of a man's home, or his auto-
mobile, is a deprivation of his property; and the same
conclusion should be reached in the matter of intangi-
bles, as for instance, patent rights, or utility franchises.
These intangible rights might not be entirely appropri-
ated by others, but merely their use so restricted as to
become a deprivation of property. For instance, a per-
son possessing riparian rights should enjoy full pro-
tection under the guaranty of due process of law. The
enjoyment of city property is similarly protected. An
example of this latter situation is frequently found as
in the case of 46 S.W. 976, where it was held that the
state could not create a boulevard and restrict the utili-
zation of abuting property to high priced residences.
This decision was correctly reached, because it was a
restriction against the adjacent property owners and
did not apply indiscriminately to the entire community.
Kibble Telephone Company vs. Landphere, 151
Mich. 309. 115 X.W. 244, is another case in point.
The Telephone Company had a specific franchise grant-
ing it the right to the use of the streets, subject, how-
ever, to the normal use by the public. The present con-
troversy arose when Landphere received a city permit
to move his house down a street; and the Telephone
Company refused to cut its wires, thereby holding
to the strict interpretation of its franchise. It was de-
cided that this telephone franchise was a property
right, fully within the protection of the Federal Consti-
tution. Of course, this entire subject of utility fran-
chise is a vital one at the present time, because so many
cities have become dissatisfied with their present utility
arrangements.

THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION
In the past few years there has been a big tendency
among Engineers to become an exclusive group. There
has been a rapid growth of the licensing of engineers,
and now over half of the forty-eight states insist that
all of those who wish to practice engineering may do
so only after complying with legal licensing measures.
Such measures operate to raise the standards for ad-
mission to the profession, and make those already ad-
mitted realize that in order to maintain their status
they must endeavor to keep abreast of the engineering
developments. At the same time it compels allegiance
to a definite code of professional ethics.
Under the guidance of the Engineering Council for
Professional Development these movements are setting
higher standards for engineers, and because of this the
engineer must bestir himself and make himself fully
worthy of such distinction. He should strive to place
his profession on par with the other professions where
it justly belongs. 1 le should show the public that he
can do more than make and read blueprints.
LEADERSHIP
During the past twenty-five years the engineer has
been building up the vast and complicated industrial
machinery which has created the economic and social
problems that stagger the best of minds. It is about
time that he himself tried to understand what is doing
and offer remedies. The engineer when he has com-
pleted his design, building, bridge, or what have you,
turns it over to the lawyers, bankers, and politicians so
that they can reap the monetary profits. The oppor-
tunity has now come to the engineer. Can he and will
he step in and help remedy the situation? Will he as-
sume leadership and reap the profits of his work? It
is a challenge and let us make the most of it. To do
so the engineer must acquaint himself with economics
and a number of subjects which he is not familiar
with at the present time. If the engineer can correlate
these subjects with his intimate knowledge of industry
he can become a very useful public servant.
The lawyer not only practices law but is also a public
servant. The doctor not only attempts to relieve suf-
fering directly but is an important servant in matters
of public health. Has the engineer made himself promi-
nent in public life? With a few exceptions he has not.
Let's go, engineers.
THE ENGINEER'S PLACE
This period of negative prosperity has placed a new
light on the civilization of America. We are essentially
a commercial nation which depends on both agriculture
and industry to carry on this commerce. We have
found in the industrial world that the banker and the
executive have erred in the direction and management
of men and machinery. They have not only harmed
themselves but also millions of people in this and other
countries of the world . . . the engineer has also erred
in that he has been negligent in his duty to mankind.
He has designed and perfected many wonderful and
almost human, labor and time saving machines; but he
has failed to direct the use of these machines and the
consequence of their use in relation to the men whom
these machines replace.
Every civilization has progressed only in so far as its
knowledge of the use of tools has progressed. In
America we have reached a peak in mechanical culture
which no other nation has equalled. This accomplish-
ment is principally due to the efforts and science of the
engineer. He has provided the technical knowledge for
a mere pittance in remunerative return; while the so
called "business man" has assumed the right to direct
the enterprise, organized to profit from this knowledge.
by power of the capital which he represents. This latter
mentioned executive owes his loyalty to the tanking
house or controlling group of stockholders rather than
to the employee and the consumer. .
The engineer, however, is not primarily interested
in the financial aspect of industry but rather in making
this world a better place in which to live. In this atti-
tude towards his work he is merely justifying his exis-
tence in the profession. He must do more than this.
He must put himself in power to assure the working
man regular, profitable and healthful employment and
at the same time provide the consumer with economical
and serviceable products.
In order to accomplish these things he must have a
voice and a vote in the controlling group of the or-
ganization which exploits his machine or invention
and his fellow humans who operate these machines.
He will only obtain this voice and just vote on the board
or managing council by preliminary education in soci-
ology, commerce, and finance to provide the necessary
experience for such a position. In the final analysis the
engineer must do all in his power professionally, po-
litically and financially to gain and retain the place of
the real coordinator of men. science, machines and
capital. A. K. K.

Naval Tank
By L. A. BAIER,
Asst. Prof, of Naval Architecture
INCORPORATED in the plans when the West En-
gineering Building was erected, the experimental
naval tank of the Department of Naval Architec-
ture and Marine Engineering has been serving since
early in 1906. It occupies the length of the building
along East University Avenue and is the object of
curiosity for everyone but the students of Naval Archi-
tecture. At one end of the room is the workshop, where
one can see models of many types of ships: subma-
rines, sail yachts and freighters.
The tank was designed and carried to completion by
H. C. Sadler. D.Sc.. then Professor of Marine En-
gineering, now Dean of the College of Engineering.
It is the second oldest tank in the country, and one of
the three in use in the U.S. today. At present. Prof.
E. M. Bragg, head of the Department of Naval Archi-
tecture and Marine Engineering is in charge.
The tank has been used extensively since its comple-
tion for the study and development of ship forms.
Systematic research work on the variation of lines for
commercial and naval ships has contributed largely to
the present day skill of naval architects in this phase
of ship design. A wide range of experiments has cov-
ered all types of vessels, including barges, submarines,
cargo vessels, fast liners and naval craft. The effect
of shallow water on the speed of
vessels has been investigated. Roll-
ing and steering tests; stream lines.
wake and wave formations; propel-
lor and paddle wheel performances;
all have been undertaken and stud-
ied for the contribution of increased
knowledge to the art of naval archi-
tecture.
Practically all of the results of
tank research experiments have
been published in the transactions
on the Society of Naval Architects
and Marine Engineers, the Institu-
tion of Naval Architects, and other
professional societies, and many
notable papers have been presented
by both Dr. Sadler and Prof. Bragg.
Aside from the purely research
activities of the naval tank, one of
the primary functions is the deter-
mination of the power required to drive a given design.
Shipbuilders and designers submit lines of proposed ves-
sels and tests are carried out to obtain the resistance
over a range of speeds. Often many models for a pro-
posed design are tested in order to arrive at the most ef-
ficient form for the required service. These tests, before
construction of the vessel is started, protect the build-
er's guarantee of speed and fuel consumption, and also
ensure the owner an efficient and economical ship.
Other interesting tests concern the character of the
wave profile along the side of a paddle wheel steamer
in order to locate the wheel on the crest of a wave
rather than in the hollows when underway. One series
of tests was made on various types of sterns for the
high speed day boats operating on the Hudson River.
in order to reduce the excessive swells that cause
damage to shores and small boats.
The tank itself is 300 feet long, 22 feet wide and
10 feet deep, with provision made for the installation
of a false bottom simulating shallow draft conditions.
Spanning the tank is an electrically driven truck run-
ning on rails on either side of the tank. Speeds from
10 feet per minute up to 800 feet per minute can be
obtained under rheostat control. On the forward end
of the car is mounted the dynamometer thru which the
models are towed. This consists essentially of a vertical
bar mounted on Emery supports, which are thin pieces
of spring steel with about one-sixteenth inch between
supports, giving a rigid but flexible and practical fric-
tionless bearing.
The model is attached to the lower end of the dyna-
mometer bar and its' resistance taken up by a calibrated
spring fastened to the bar above the fulcrum. The re-
sistance of the model is proportional to the amount of
extension of the spring and is registered upon a re-
volving drum which is driven from the main shaft of

Football days are again filling the stadium
This is our monthly get-together wherein we pass
on bits of news about your fellow engineers. We
like to tell you where they are and what they're
doing, and we hope you like to read our offerings.
But of course we have to have the information
before we can print it, and the most satisfactory
method of obtaining it is to hear directly from you.
So we'd appreciate it if you would drop a card in
the nearest mailbox, especially if your name hasn't
been in these columns recently or if your circum-
stances have changed since it has been in. You
need only give us information such as that we print
below, either about yourself or your classmates,
but in ain- event we'll be glad to hear from you.
In response to a number of inquiries, we wish to
make an explanatory remark regarding our method
of grouping according to classes. The year follow-
ing the alumnus's name is. insofar as our records
permit, the year in which he graduated, rather than
the year in which any advanced degrees were re-
ceived. This seems the most natural method of
classification.
Now that that's over, we're ready to start on this
month's notes. Again we have a great predominance
of recent graduates, all of which you may interpret
as a sure sign of an upturn if you so desire. But at
any rate here they are, so gather around, grads,
and read the latest about your classmates.

Wheels on Air
Rail Car Utilizes "Wheels en Air"
Amid the trend for efficiency, smoothness and quiet-
ness in public vehicles, a new rail car has come to the
forefront. This particular car which was imported to
this country especially for demonstration purposes, is
a light weight, rubber tired, and gasoline driven car
designed and built by the Austro-Daimler A.G. Vienna.
Austria.
In the development of the design employed in this
rail car, the manufacturers have worked out an ex-
tremely light weight chassis of truss formation built
up of pressed sections welded throughout. Pneumatic
tires support the load of the vehicle and transmit the
propelling force to steel tires which guide the car
along the track. These tracks are not connected to the
frame and as a result all vertical and lateral shocks
are transmitted to and absorbed by the rubber tires
which have separate axles suspended on semi-elliptic
springs. The axle arrangement is particularly inter-
esting. It is what may be called a double axle ar-
rangement in which one axle supports the steel tired
rail wheel of the car on roller bearings. The carrying
axle, in which the driving shaft is housed, is suspended
on springs not of the ordinary type, but specially de-
signed and embodying a sliding surface under which
the top leaves of the springs move. As a special pre-
caution in case of flat tire, the carrying axle can drop
a distance and so be supported on the guiding axle.
It is estimated that due to the smooth inner surface
of the steel tire the life of the tire will be from 75,000
to 100,000 miles.
In the transmission of this car an extremely new
feature is involved. The system, hydraulic in nature, is
a combination of an hydraulic clutch for direct drive
Notes of the
Profession
and hydraulic torque transformer for acceleration for
up-hill haul. The direct clutch is sufficient for a grade
up to two per cent and having maximum speeds of
80-90 miles per hour. The mechanical efficiency of this
clutch is 98%. The hydraulic transformer used when
starting and for up-hill hauls consists of a centrifugal
pump and turbine, the combined efficiency of which is
85^. The change from clutch to transformer or re-
verse is accomplished by the automatic emptying of
either as the speed increases.
In addition to the ease of operation, which is con-
trolled by the manipulation of a single wheel, another
advantage which is claimed for this car is that the
system of air suspension having steel wheels on the
rails provides a metallic contact across the rails for
signal operation.
Rail cars of this design are particularly adapted to
roadbeds of extreme curvature and in European serv-
ice curves of 600 feet are regularly negotiated at speeds
of 37 m.p.h., where, by comparison, steam locomotives
must restrict their speed to 28 m.p.h.—Railway Me-
chanical Eiu)inecr.
Fabricating the World's Largest Valves
More than four million pounds of steel and special
materials are required in the production of the world's
largest valves at the East Pittsburgh Works of the
\\estinghouse Electric and .Manufacturing Company
and to ship them to the Boulder Dam will require about
ninety railroad cars. A total of eight gates, two in each
intake tower will control the flow of water to the power
plant developing 1,835,000 horsepower. With the ex-
ception of the cast steel throat liner and the small de-
flection plates, each gate is fabricated entirely by arc
welding from steel plate.
In accordance with the lxiiler code requirements for
class two welding, eighty welders were trained for this
job for which a special heavy coated welding rod was
developed. Standard steel plate was rolled, cut to size
and welded from the thirty-two foot cylindrical gates
and nose liners. Because of the size and the accuracy re-
quired, the welding and machining presented many un-
usual problems. Due to the carefulness with which the
mammoth gates were fabricated, every piece fit into
place with precision and a water tight seal was secured
in the test assembly at the shops.
In the construction of the gates, over 4.600.000

steel castings, bronze, copper, stainless steel and monel
metal. More than one mile of welding is used in the
fabrication of one gate. Kach gate assembly consists
of a throat liner, a cylindrical valve, a nose liner, valve
guides and minor fittings.
The throat liner, thirty-seven feet in diameter, is
of cast steel, in twelve sections. The partings were
machined on each section. Then the seats and faces
were finished in position. Kach nose liner is all welded
and fabricated mainly from 2" and 2^4" steel plate
hot formed on a 1500 ton press and fastened to the
throat liner with 312 bolts. There are 28.200 inches
of weld employing 252 positions of the sub and main
assemblies to complete the welding on this largest sta-
tionary part of the gate. It is made in six sections
bolted together. A total of 2.514 holes of various sizes
are drilled in the liner for bolting on the guide rails,
throat liner, seats and entrance liners.
The monel metal seats making the water tight seal
between the gate valve and the throat and nose liners
are very carefully machined. 110.000 pounds being
used for that purpose. Adjusting screws are provided
for obtaining a perfect seal and locking into position
on the upper seat only of each gate.
The cylindrical gate valves weigh 240.300 pounds
and are formed entirely from steel plates cold rolled
and welded. Kach is made in six segments. Seven
stiffening ribs, cold rolled from 2^4" x 11^4" stock
on vertical rolls exerting a pressure of 575.000 pounds.
are welded in position in each valve. To prevent water
turbulence steel plates will be bolted over these ribs on
the lower gates only. Also, specially cast steel deflection
plates will be placed atop the lower gates to prevent
turbulence and wear at the top seat.
The entire lower gate including the stationary and


Gate for Boulder Dam in process of construction
moveable parts weighs 523,858 pounds and will be
placed in the base of one of the 340 feet towers with
another gate 150 feet higher. At the base the towers
are 95 feet in diameter. When finished, the dam will
be the highest and largest ever constructed forming
a lake 30.000.000 acre-feet or about 11,000.000.-
000.000 gallons, the largest artificial lake in the world.
Compact direct-driven compressor oper-
ating at 1150 RPM
High Speed Compressors Have Advantage
Until the last few years compressors have been driven
almost entirely by means of belts and gears, at speeds
of only 100 to 500 r.p.m. Today reciprocating compres-
sors are being operated with entire success at two or
three times this speed, with appreciable advantages in
performance.
Klectric refrigeration and later air-conditioning con-
tributed largely to these changes, with the result that
these modern compressors provide a number of out-
standing features, such as, light weight, quietness, free-
dom of vibration and high efficiency.
The advantage of light weight and small overall di-
mensions are obvious, especially in refrigeration and
air-conditioning applications. Other benefits, not so
apparent but none the less real, are almost equally im-
portant. Compactness is obtained not only because of
the elimination of bulky speed-reducing mechanism but
also because the displacement per unit of time is
achieved with smaller cylinders as a result of the higher
operating speed. Consequently, bearings, crankshaft
and all other parts of the compressor become smaller
and chea1&gt;er. Compactness, therefore, means less ex-
pensive replacement of parts and lower first cost, or
higher quality at the same cost.
Quietness of operation is becoming a more rigid re-
quirement every day. In a sale of air-conditioning
equipment noise is often a deciding factor, and much
thought is being given to reducing this by flexible
mountings, sound proof cabinets and the like. The
direct connected compressor has a decided advantage at
the start over those driven by belts and gearing be-
cause of the absence of belt slap and vibration or ob-
jectionable gear hum.

November on the Huron
Colonel Rogers
We have a new man on the campus this fall in the
faculty. A man with a military record behind him
which makes him without doubt as competent as any to
fill the position he now occupies. Those in the R.O.T.C.
know him well by now for his office is open to any who
want his advice. I refer to Colonel Frederick C. Rogers.
Col. Rogers was born in Wisconsin in 1884, and
immediately had close relations with the military serv-
ice, his father being an army officer. Later on, how-
ever, he became still more closely connected with the
service since his brother-in-law was also an army officer.
But that's getting ahead of the story. He attended the
University of Minnesota for a time, and then in De-
cember, 1908, he received his first commission. At that
time, vacancies in the Army—after the West Point
graduates had been placed—were filled by civilians
through competitive examinations. As a second lieuten-
ant he spent two years in Alaska, and also another two
years in San Francisco. In 1916, he was promoted to a
first lieutenant while on the Mexican border. The fol-
lowing year in May, he was made a captain, and less
than a month later, he became a temporary major in the
Regular Army. Almost simultaneously with this ap-
pointment he was also a major in the National Army.
However, he vacated this last commission three months
later. There were two branches of the United States
Army at that time (1918): the Regular Army, which
is self-explanatory; and the National Army, which was
formed during the war period.
From the Mexican border he was detailed to Camp
Hancock in Georgia, a machine gun center, to command
a regiment. From there he went to the Assistant
Adjutant General in the Eastern Department in New
York City. His next location was at Antwerp in south-
ern Belgium. He remained there until 1919 when he
was ordered to Coblentz as personnel adjutant, but
upon his arrival there, he was given the job of pur-
chasing Quartermaster supplies for the entire Ameri-
College
Not
can forces in Germany. In November, 1920, he was
transfered to the Quartermaster Corps, having in the
meantime received his majority. He continued in the
same capacity in Coblentz until 1921. Two years later
he was transfered back to the Infantry. In 1925, he
was graduated from the Infantry School, Advanced
Course; from the Command General Staff School in
1926; and from the War College in 1933. During the
years 1930 to 1932 he was in command of a regiment,
16th Infantry, at Governor's Island. With the excep-
tion of the war period, his entire military career has
been with the 16th Infantry.
His appointment to his present position came as a
complete surprise to him. He was asked over the
phone whether he would like to go to Michigan. After
a two-minutes deliberation, he answered in the affirma-
tive. That's all there was to it. On the first of last
month he was promoted to a lieutenant-colonel.
And especially after the local unit's recent enlarge-
ment so that it is now a regiment. Col. Rogers is very
optimistic about the future of the unit.
Sigma Xi
Sigma Xi, honorary research fraternity, held its first
monthly meeting on Monday, October 16. The mem-
bers met in Room 100 in Hutchins Hall. After an in-
troductory address by Dean Bates, of the Law School,
those present were shown thru the new buildings. Of
special interest were the air-conditioning plant, the
faculty library, the offices of the "Michigan Law Re-
view", a local publication, and the practice court.
The Cook Legal Research Library was also visited.
The trip thru the Law Quadrangle ended with the
serving of refreshments in the Dining Hall.
A. S. M. E. Meeting
The reason behind the N.R.A. and the current doings
of the movement, were the topics explained by Robert
P. Briggs of the Department of Economics at the sec-
ond meeting of the A.S.M.E., students' branch, on
Wednesday evening, October 18, at the Michigan
Union.
The part played by the government, the all-important
need of whole-hearted public support, and the way the

N.R.A. was stressed by Mr. Briggs.
Frederick Kohl, president of the students' branch,
presided over the short business meeting that preceded
Mr. Briggs' address. Kohl again explained to prospec-
tive members that membership was not limited to stu-
dents of the College of Engineering, but was open to
anyone who was interested in subjects related to the
field of mechanical engineering in the engineering
world.
Students, becoming members of the A.S.M.E., re-
ceive, in addition to the many privileges that are fea-
tures of this organization, the official journal of the
Society, Mechanical Engineering, Kohl added.
o
A. I. E. E. Meeting
To give students a proper perspective of electrical
engineering by affording intimate relations with the
electrical engineer and his problems is the purpose of
the student branch of the American Institute of Elec-
trical Engineering, declared Professor S. S. Attwood
of the Department of Electrical Engineering before the
first meeting of the A.I.E.E., student branch, on Oc-
tober 18th.
Four contact programs are expected to be held this
year with the Bell Telephone, Westinghouse Electric.
General Electric, and the American Telephone and
Telegraph Companies, Prof. Attwood added. Repre-
sentatives of these companies, he explained, give talks
to the students who are afterwards privileged to inter-
view them.
With membership, Prof. Attwood noted, the student
becomes a subscriber to the Journal, magazine of the
Institute. This Journal, he indicated, contains profes-
sional news, papers presented before the Institute, and
articles of general engineering interest.
Officers for the year are:
W. H. Powers, chairman,
J. F. Crouter, vice-chairman.
A. S. Bassette, secretary,
O. C. Morris, treasurer.
The meeting voted to meet on Tuesday evening of
every third week.
A film, " In His Father's Footsteps". Westinghouse
release, illustrating the utility of electricity on the farm,
concluded the meeting.
Varsity Band
On Saturday morning, Octolier 28, the University of
Michigan Band of over 100 men left for Chicago, on
its only football trip of the season.
The band arrived in Chicago at noon and paraded
from the 53rd St. Station to the Hotel Windemere.
where headquarters were established. Blue mackinaws
were issued to the bandsmen. After luncheon, the band
marched to Stagg Field for the Chicago game.
At dinner that evening, the new men had to eat with-
out silverware as a part of their initiation, after dinner
the band boarded the elevated for the Fair and upon
their arrival there the bandsmen paraded to the Court
of the States, where a short concert was given.
Following this the men were free to do what they
pleased. The great majority of them stayed at the Fair.
Some visited friends, while others managed to attend
the various theatres, night clubs, and burlesques.
On Sunday, breakfast was served from 8 o'clock on,
so that those who felt so inclined could catch up on some
lost sleep. There was no definite program on Sunday
until 2 o'clock, when the band presented a concert of
classical and semi-classical numbers in the Court of the
Hall of Science. The program included among other
selections, von Weber's overture, Oberon. Tschaikow-
sky's Marche Slave, a portion of Wagner's opera, Tris-
tan and Isolde, and concluded with the singing of the
The Yellow and Blue.
At 6 o'clock, the majority of the boys took the special
train back to Ann Arlx&gt;r, which arrived here at mid-
night. The bandsmen had the privilege of taking a later
train if they wanted to.
The personnel of the band on the trip included Lieut.
R. F. Coursey, Drillmaster; Prof. Nicholas Falcone,
Director; Faculty Manager Herbert G. Watkins;
Donald Strouse. '35. Drum-major; Mr. Cecil Ellis, for-
mations officer; Kenneth Campbell, '34E, student man-
ager; Wellington B. Huntley. '34. librarian; W. Stod-
dard White, '35, publicity director; a baggagemaster
and an assistant student manager.
Engineering Elections
The campus politicians on this side of the campus
witnessed the innovation of a new system in connection
with the class elections this fall. Previously, the en-
gineering class elections had been conducted at a class
meeting. This fall, however, the Engineering Council,
working with the Student Council, supervised the elec-
tions.
The seniors elected to class lxisitions are as follows:
Louis W. Westover, president; John H. Skinner, vice-
president; John C. Seeley, treasurer; David Burnette,
secretary; Arthur Mosier. Honor Committee; and John
S1xulen. Engineering Council.
Among the juniors, the New Deal Party clinched all
the offices, except that of J-Hop Chairman, which went
to Phil Singleton, of the opposition. The list follows:
Tage Jacobson, president; Harold Roehrig, vice-presi-
dent; Al Marshall, secretary; Bob Sloane, treasurer;
Bill Miller and John Holden, Engineering Council;
Russell Houvener, Honor Committee; and for the J-
Hop Committee. John Garrels and Gale Sterling.
The sophomore officers were filled by the following
galaxy of embryo politicians: Robert Fox, president:
Kenneth Mosier, vice-president; Warren Underwood,
secretary; Charles Framburg, treasurer; Charles Frick.
Engineering Council; and Robert Hammon. Honor
Committee.

RICHARD H. McMANUS
iHE heart of Nature's Playground", to the un-
initiated. Traverse City, harbored the infant
Richard McManus. Reaching boyhood, Dick
McManus, accompanying the other members of the
family, moved to Detroit and settled down amidst the
noise and hustle of war-time activities.
Jefferson Intermediate saw the beginning of Dick's
career. He. the budding transportation
engineer, dimly realized the necessity
of going places, and since the track team
offered a means of transporting himself.
Dick became a track man. Then Dick
commenced going, for he became a mem-
ber of the J. Club. Dramatics, too. in-
terested this lad and it is said that
Thomas Jefferson is a person whose
chief claim to fame is that he was once
portrayed by Richard McManus.
In the natural course of events came
Central High School where Dick won
five letters, became a member of the C.
Club, and was on the student council.
Track, however, was still his chief pas-
sion.
During the summers, Dick was, until
the last year, an officer in different
scout camps in Michigan.
With the fall wind, three years ago,
blew in Freshman McManus. Working
up a deep hatred for the sophomore class,
he helped make the class games a great
success. Tradition has it that he tus-
sled with the renowned Harvey Bauss. Tradition also
has it that Dick emerged triumphant and the sophomore
flag his prize.
As a Frosh cross-countrv man, Dick won the Fresh-
man Cross-Country Cup.
Dick, deciding to dabble in politics, became the vice-
president of the sophomore class. In his junior year.
Dick was a member of the Athletic Committee. This
year saw him in the same field, that cif a member of the
Student Disciplinary Committee in the new Student
Council.
Besides indulging in his hobby of track and cross-
country, Dick is a member of the Y'ulcans, the Tri-
angles, and the A.S.M.E. He was also a Slide Rule
Ball committeeman.
Current rumor has it that Dick is engaged to one
Lucille Palmer. When asked concerning the truth of
this statement, Dick's own remark was, "I won't com-
mit myself". Gentlemen, we wonder about this state-
ment; but should the engagement exist, the Engineer-
ing Spotlight offers its congratulations.

Dick and Louie
LOUIS W. WESTOVER
BAY CITY. "Where The Summer Trails Begin",
saw the beginning of Louis Westover. As quar-
terback for the "Indians" on the Central High
School football team, he was outstanding as a passer;
and in his last year of high school the "Indians" tied
for State championship.
Then, not content with being a member of the State
championship football team, Lou went
one step further and won the Michigan
Honor Trophy—an award given for
excellence in both scholarship and in
athletics.
The University of Michigan became
Lou's Alma Mater ulxin his graduating
from Central High. As a freshman. Lou
helped contribute to the success of the
Freshman and Sophomore Games by an
able demonstration of both wit and
brawn. In the fall. Lou succeeded in
making the Freshman football squad,
and in the following spring, the fresh-
man baseball team.
Becoming a sophomore, Lou became a
quarterback on the Varsity Football
Squad, a position which he has con-
tinued to hold. Not only is he interested
in varsity athletics, but Intramural
Squash also occupies his attention.
Every campus celebrity, naturally, is
at some time during his college career,
interested in politics. The same is true
of Lou. the mechanical and industrial
engineer, for he was secretary of his Sophomore class,
and this year is president of the Senior class.
A great deal of credit can be given to Lou for his
exceptional record in scholarship. To play on Michi-
gan's varsity and remain in the luigineering college is
in itself a difficult feat. This is well demonstrated hy
the fact that there are very few Engineering students
on the varsity team. Lou has not only accomplished this
feat but has received grades which place him above
the average student. His initiation into Tau Beta Pi
this month proved him to be the ideal "athlete-student"
combination.
The Michigan Daily's staff of reporters that canvass
the Varsity Squad is composed solely of members of
the weaker sex. Never yet has Lou succumbed to their
womanly wiles, the reason -being, according to brother
Chi Psi's. an unknown attraction in Saginaw.
A tip, now, for those of Michigan Daily's staff of
female football reporters whose hearts' throb upon
hearing Bing Crosby and others of his ilk—Lou West-
over is the crooner for the Chi Psi's house parties.

"... in his eyes shineth a far-away look"
Stresses and Strains
THE 23RD PSALM OF AN ENGINEER'S
SWEETHEART
Verily, I say unto you, marry not an engineer.
For an engineer is a strange being, and is possessed
of many evils.
Yea, he speaketh eternally in parables which he call-
eth formulae,
And he wiekleth a big stick which he calleth a slide-
rule,
And he hath only one bible, a handbook.
He thinketh only of stresses and strain, and without
end of thermodynamics.
He showeth always a serious aspect, and seemeth not
to know how to smile, and he picketh his seat in a car
by the springs therein and not by the damsel.
Neither does he know a waterfall except by its horse-
power, nor a sunset except that he must turn on the
lights, nor a damsel except by her live weight.
Always he carrieth his books with him, and he en-
tertaineth his sweetheart with steam tables.
Verily, though his damsel expecteth chocolates when
he calleth.
She openeth the package but to disclose samples of
iron ore.
Yea, he holdeth his damsel's hand but to measureth
friction thereof.
And he kisseth her only to test the viscosity of her
lips.
For in his eyes there shineth a far-away look that
is neither
Love nor longing—rather a vain attempt to recall a
formula.
There is but one key to his heart, and that is Tau
Beta Pi, and
When his damsel writeth of love and signeth with
crosses, he
Taketh these symbols not for kisses, but rather
For unknown quantities.
Even as a boy he pulleth a girl's hair but to test its
elasticity.
But as a man he discovereth different devices; For
he counteth the vibrations of her heartstrings; and
He seeketh ever to pursue his scientific investigations
even his own heart flutterings he counteth as a vision
of beauty, and enscribeth his passion as a formula.
And his marriage is as a simultaneous equation in-
volving two unknowns, and yielding diverse results.
We are indebted to the Annapolis Log for permission
to reprint the foregoing selection.
SOLILOQUY
1 laving seated ourselves in the editorial sanctum with
the purpose of setting down in permanent form for the
benefit of posterity some of the gems of wit and humor
with which we are so richly endowed, it is somewhat
of a shock to find that we have propped our pedal ex-
tremities upon the desk, fixed our gaze upon a fly-speck
on the opposite wall, and have been calmly meditating
on the largeness of Life. Oblivious to the hustle and
bustle of the world about us, we recline in quiet con-
templation of the cosmos and even the harsh voice of
the managing editor reminding us that the dead-line
draweth nigh and advising us to bestir ourself fails to
rouse us from our reverie. For the moment we are pon-
dering the maxims of that ancient Chinese philosopher,
Sling Bull, in whom was the wisdom of the ages.
It was Sling Bull who, counseling the young men
that sought his words, said, "He who burns the mid-
night oil may be wiser than he who burns the candle
at both ends, but, 1 ask you, who has the most fun?"
It was Sling Bull who said, "God in His wisdom
made man before woman; man in his ignorance didn't
know enough to take advantage of his head-start."
And who was it who said, "The love of money may
be the root of all evil, but what grieves us most is that
so much of our affection is unrequited?" You're right,
it was Sling Bull.
In fact Sling Bull is credited with many wise say-
ings. It was he who said:
A hick town is the place where you can move into a
house and not smell the nationality of the last tenent.
That men marry for convenience, that woman marry
for convenience, and that the former are disappointed.
That there are two classes of pedestrians, the quick

Critical temp 980° F.
A rather complete compilation of all the properties
of diphenyl has been made by the Federal Phosphorus
Company of Aniston, Alabama, who manufacture this
product in commercial quantities by the decomposition
of hot benzene vapors. There is no limit to the avail-
ability of diphenyl. and the price is rather reasonable.
Of course, before deciding that diphenyl was a good
vapor to use in high temperature control it was neces-
sary to find out what heat transfer coefficients could
be obtained in practice, in order to know whether the
method would pay. Experiments were carried out in
the Chemical Engineering laboratories of this univer-
sity under the direction of Prof. W. L. Badger, and
sponsored by the Swenson Evaporator Company of
Harvey, 11l. The experimental apparatus and the re-
sults obtained are too complicated to permit discussion
at this time, but the results may be summarized by
stating that the coefficient varied from 200 to 500 de-
pending on the temperature of the vapor and the tem-
perature difference between vapor and wall. This
coefficient is noticeably lower than that obtainable with
steam, due largely to the difference in the thermal
conductivity of the two liquids. However, the value is
still high enough to warrant the use of the vapor in
practice, since in very few cases does the other tilm
coefficient become much greater.
Some of the possible applications of the use of di-
phenyl as a heating medium may be of interest at this
time. Some few applications are already in commercial
practice and others are still in the experimental stage.
In the field of evaporation there is a. distinct opening
for such a method of heating. In the evaporation of
such high-boiling solutions as caustic soda and potash,
present-day practice is to evalx&gt;rate with steam to about
sixty or seventy percent. The solution is then put into
large cast-iron containers called caustic pots which are
heated by direct fire. The solution is evaporated for
about a week until the desired concentration is reached,
which is about one hundred percent. These pots are
very expensive and have a rather short life, and in addi-
tion the fuel economy is low. The heat transfer co-
efficient is extremely low since there is no positive
circulation of the hot gases, and values as low as one
or two are estimated. It has been impossible to use
nickel or monel in these pots because of the large
surface required, and a large amount of impurity is
formed by corrosion of the cast iron.
Experiments were made on a semi-plant basis using
diphenyl as the heating medium and caustic soda was
evaporated to almost 99% using a diphenyl pressure
of about 150 lbs. per sq. in. The heat transfer coeffi-
cient from the metal to the boiling liquor was found to
be so great that practically the entire temperature dif-
ference was over the diphenyl vapor film. This meant
that the overall coefficient from the vapor to the liquor
was about the same as that of the vapor to the wall,
i.e., 200 to 500, as compared with the value of about
2 obtained in the caustic pots. This high coefficient
permits the use of nickel as a heating surface, very
little corrosion takes place, and the product is made
much purer. The time required for evaporation is very
much less by this new method, and the fuel economy
could be made very much better, since there is no rea-
son why a diphenyl boiler cannot be designed to be as
efficient as the ordinary water boiler.
A great deal of trouble has been experienced in dis-
tilling lubricating oils without decomposition, and at
the same time obtaining large yields. A very slight
overheating of some of the oil constituents results in
their decomposition and though these decomposition
products are not a very large fraction of the oil they are
very detrimental to its use as a lubricant, since they
tend to become sticky and adher to the part to be
lubricated. No satisfactory method has been found
to completely remove these materials after they are
once formed, and it is necessary to prevent their for-
mation as much as possible.
A large plant has been built at the Indian Refining
Company's plant at Lawrenceville, 111., using diphenyl
to actually evaporate the oil, which is at the same time
kept at a very low pressure (3 mm. absolute) in order
to lower the boiling point of the oil as much as possible.
By this method overheating is prevented, and a larger
yield of oil obtained which is at the same time more
viscous and stable.
In the polymerization of varnish oils the present
practice is to heat the oil in an ordinary container over
an open fire, mixing the materials periodically. This
results in overheating and decomposition, with the for-
mation of fatty acids which tend to slow up the reaction
and to color the product. The use of diphenyl for this
case would undoubtedly result in the production of a
purer, more uniform product in a very much shorter
time, with less expense. An exhaustive study of this
problem is under way at the present time.
There are a great many other places where the use
of diphenyl vapor would aid, either in the production
of a purer product, or in increasing the present rate of
production. Many catalytic reactions require closc
temperature control, with absence of any overheating,
and in many cases this is possible at present only with
electric heat. The distillation and evaporation of mate-
rials that are very sensitive to heat may be carried out
in ordinary apparatus, using this new but very promis-
ing method of high temperature control.

the cover, contents page, illustrations aml the text
matter itself. The E.C.M.A. does a great service in
this field for it makes for higher editorial standards
and brings advice from men more experienced in the
publishing field, a help always acceptable by the vari-
ous college editors. By E.C.M.A. monthly criticsms,
a magazine using poor methods or practices can be
warned and the difficulties remedied before they be-
come too serious. Many of the delegates had their own
opinions on correct editorial practice and some of them
differed widely from those of the Chairman and the
other member magazines.
The afternoon of the second day was given to the
reports of the various committees and uncompleted
business. The liveliest fracas of the convention oc-
curred at this time. One of the member magazines
attempted to get the Association to change their national
advertising policies and sparks flew before the issue
was settled.
Each year at the annual convention, awards are
made to the magazines standing highest in a particular
field over the past year's time. Awards are given to
the leaders in the following departments; Covers.
Alumni Department. Feature Stories. Illustrations,
Editorials, Single Story and Single Editorial. The
Technic took first prize for its series of covers and
second prize for its Alumni Section. The cover award
was given to this magazine because of the simplicity
of the cover make-up and the fact that all illustrations
dealt with an engineering subject. Next year the
E.C.M.A. will inaugurate the practice of presenting a
plaque to the best all-around magazine in the group.
Chairman Winfrey said that if such an award had been
made this year it would have been given to the Minne-
sota Techno-log.
The evening between the two convention days was
amply filled by a banquet and a smoker. An excellent
variety of speakers and entertainment featured the
banquet while the smoker went further in substanti-
ating two of Milwaukee's greatest attributes—her hos-
pitality and her brew. The Marquette Engineer is to
be congratulated on its success in arranging this con-
vention and making it possible for the delegates to
have a thoroughly enjoyable time.
DUE PROCESS OF LAW
(Continued from page 8)
The actual wording of the franchise is very import-
ant. In the case of Walla Walla vs Walla Walla Water
Co., 43 L.Ed. 341. the franchise provided that the
Water Company had a full right to furnish the people
of the city with water, and that the city of Walla Walla
should not enter this utility field as a competitor of the
Water Company. The franchise was not exclusive,
the city having full power to grant a new franchise to
a competing company. The court decided that the fran-

Constitution that the city of Walla Walla was forbidden
to serve its citizens with water. A somewhat similar
decision was reached in the case of the Seattle Electric
Company vs. Seattle Railroad Company. 185 Fed. 365.
The court therein held that the due process clause of-
fered protection of the franchise rights.
The cardinal principle of all these constitutional
guarantees is to the effect that life, liberty and property
will not I&gt;e taken without due process of law. It is
important, therefore, that we examine the phrase to
understand properly its meaning. Smith vs. State .Medi-
cal Examiners, 117 N.W. 1116, was a case wherein the
Board was trying to revoke the medical certificate of
Dr. Smith. 11 is defense was that such a delegated board
lacked jurisdiction, and that the method of trial before
a Board of Examiners did not, of itself, constitute due
process of law. The Supreme Court decided otherwise,
stating in part: "due process of law does not require
that any particular form of proceedings be observed.
but only that the same shall be regular proceedings, in
which notice is given of the claim asserted, and an op-
portunity to be afforded to defend against it. ... Every
requisite of the law is met if the party be given a fair
and reasonable opportunity to be heard". This test of
due process is, in reality, no different from that enunci-
ated by Daniel Webster, ninety years earlier.
A conflict with the "police power" of the state i.s
probably responsible for many of the unsuccessful at-
tempts to secure the protection of the due process
clause. For instance, an individual apparently has the
property right to engage in legitimate business in his
community, such as the collection of garbage. In Gard-
ner vs. Michigan, 100 N.W. 126, we find Gardner de-
nied this right under the following circumstances: The
city of Detroit let a contract to a concern for the col-
lection of all of its garbage. Gardner, being in the
business of purchasing garbage from large hotels to be
used as feed for his hogs, objected to the city destroying
his business without due process of law. The court,
however, held that the intrusion upon individual rights
was legitimate and justified, based upon the fact that
the city had full control over the use of its streets.
This is, in fact, an exercise of the police power based
upon the public health of the community, and is su-
perior to the right of the individual to engage in busi-
ness.
Polution of streams is a frequent subject of litiga-
tion, and is particularly controversial in Michigan. For
instance. Attorney General vs. Grand Rapids, 141 N.W.
890. is a case in which the village of Wyoming, a lower
riparian owner, was objecting to the city of Grand Rap-
ids dumping its sewage into the Grand River at a point
up-stream from the village. The court instructed the
city of .Grand Rapids to abate the nuisance, saying in
substance that while a city, as a riparian owner, has
the right to make a reasonable use of the waters of a
river, it cannot impair the enjoyment of the water for
other riparian proprietors, nor can it interfere with
such use by depositing extraneous substances into the
stream, thereby polluting it.
It might seem that due process of law could be raised
as a protection against high taxes, but the constitu-
tional guaranty has no application here. The levying of
taxes is a legislative function, and may be iml&gt;osed
even to the extinction of the property levied u1xin.
The only restriction is that the tax levy must rest on all
alike, and be non-discriminatory. Relief from high
taxes lies in public opinion.
The protection under the due process clause is so
broad that many different types of controversies have
been presented for relief. Judging by SOUK- of the
unsuccessful and weaker cases, it would appear that
many briefs have l&gt;een drawn up in the mere hope that
the cause might yet be saved in some mysterious man-
ner. In fact, the due process clause is occasionally re-
ferred to as the "last straw of litigation".

During recent years yacht designers have come to
take advantage of the tank facilities during the design-
ing of the modern high-speed yacht. Progressive de-
signers of sailing yachts have found that scientific data
obtainable from model tank tests are much superior
to a dependence upon the "eye sweetness" of a form
as a means of turning out an efficient hull.

Coal Mining
By W. W. SLOAN E
WHILE the existence of coal and its value as
fuel have been known for over two thousand
years, it has been mined commercially for a
little over seven hundred years. In those early days in
England the mines, if they may be called by that name,
were simply open pits. The coal was dug by the use of
iron tipped wooden bars and carried out in baskets. Only
a limited amount could be obtained by this method and
as the demand for coal increased, deeper mining became
a necessity, so a hole large enough to admit a man was
dug in the ground to the bottom of the coal seam and
as much coal was mined
from the bottom of the
hole as could be obtained
without having it cave in.
Then this hole was aban-
doned and another hole
dug.
From this humble begin-
ning coal mining has de-
veloped until the modern
mine is an elaborate in-
stitution, planned by ex-
perienced engineers, ope-
rated by a trained organi-
zation and utilizing steam
or electrical driven ma-
chinery wherever possible. Seven hundred years ago
the output of a mine was but a few tons. Today there
are many mines whose daily capacity is over 10,000
tons.
Coal lies in seams, not in pockets as do some of our
other underground resources, and there is no uniform-
ity in the various seams. Some are flat, some rolling;
some are level, others have a steep pitch; some have
solid rock directly above them, others have slate or
shale; some have rock below the coal, while others may
have clav. The thickness varies from a fraction of an
inch up to eighty or ninety feet. These are only a
few of the variations that exist. There might be added:
depth below the surface, character of the coal, amount
of impurities, presence of water or gas and many
others. All of these factors must be considered
in planning and operating a mine.

Shaker Conveyor With Duckbill
The majority of the bituminous coal mined in the
United States comes from seams having a thickness of
between thirty inches and ninety-six inches, and which
are reasonably level. Above the seam is often a layer
of slate. This must be prevented from falling by tim-
bers and posts. Alxive the slate is solid rock. Seams
of this type and size may be mined by machinery and
only where some economic condition alters the situation
is it practical to mine thinner seams. Thicker seams
are relatively rare.
It is under these conditions that mechanical mining
has been developed to its
present state and that large
production has been ob-
tained.
If such a seam lies in a
mountain, it is entered at
the outcrop; i.e.. where
coal meets the surface. If
it is at a considerable dis-
tance below the surface a
shaft is sunk to the bot-
tom of the coal. From the
bottom of the shaft tun-
nels or entries are driven
which eventuallv are ex-
tended to the ends of the
property. These are called "main entries". From the
main entries are driven other entries, designated as 1st
North, 2nd North, etc., and from these are driven what
are known as "butt entries".
Entries are always driven at least in pairs; that is.
at least two entries are driven side by side and in mines
where large quantities of explosive gas are encoun-
tered, sometimes three or four are driven. At regular
intervals, as the entries are advanced, openings called
"cross-cuts" are driven between them and as each new
cross-cut is opened the preceding one is closed. Where
two entries are driven, air is forced into one of them
or exhausted from the other and the cross-cuts so main-
tained that fresh air is carried to as near the ends as
possible—both for the benefit of the miners and to
remove any explosive gas that may otherwise collect.
Where large quantities of gas are encountered enough

Goodman Power Shovel In Operation
air must be supplied to dilute it below the igniting point.
To carry this large quantity of air, additional entries
may be necessary.
Where the seam is less than four or five feet high,
the strata above or below is removed to make the entry
height at least six feet.
According to the nature of the overlying strata en-
tries are usually from eight feet to twenty-four feet
wide. In them are carried the electrical power lines for
operating the machinery and are laid the tracks on
which the coal is hauled from the face where it is mined
to the foot of the shaft.
From the butt entries "rooms" are driven and it is
from these rooms that the bulk of the coal is obtained.
While the entrance or "neck" of the room is no wider
than the entry, the room itself is from twelve to thirty
feet wide and is mined out until it is from two hundred
to three hundred feet long. The end of the room from
which the coal is first mined is called the ''face" and the
sides of the room the "ribs".
At the first mining a wall or pillar of coal from ten
feet to thirty feet wide is left between adjoining rooms
to prevent the top caving in.
After the rooms have reached their full length, coal is
mined from the pillars until as much coal has been taken
as can be done with safety, or until the limits estab-
lished by the State Mining Laws have been reached.
At regular intervals, as the rooms are advanced, cross-
cuts are mined between adjoining rooms so that air can
be circulated at the room faces. Where the coal is to be
loaded into the cars at the face, tracks are laid in the
rooms. If the coal seam is not high enough to admit
a mine car, sufficient rock is blasted from the bottom to
make room for it.
The first operation in mining coal is the cutting. This
is done by an electrically driven machine which is avail-
able in several types, the principle of all of them being
the same. A large strong chain is driven by an electric
motor around a cutter arm. This arm is from six feet
to nine feet long and about eighteen inches wide, with
guides around the edge to support the chain. The
chain is made up of blocks and straps like a bicycle
chain, except it is much larger, the blocks weighing
several pounds. In each block is a rectangular hole in
which a pointed steel cutter bit is inserted and held by
a set screw. The holes in the blocks are so arranged
that the bits set in various positions, some pointing
straight out while others are at different angles on both
sides.
The cutter arm and moving chain are forced into
and across the face of the coal, cutting a slot or "kerf"
in the face from one rib to the other. The purpose of
the kerf is to provide space for breaking the coal loose.
When a cut has been made much less powder is used
to shoot the coal than if it was blasted without a cut
and also the quality of the coal is improved. The kerf
is from five inches to six inches high and from six feet
to nine feet deep. It may be cut at the bottom or top
of the seam, or at any height between. Usually the
cut is made at the bottom, in which case holes are drilled
near the top, charged with powder and the coal shot
down. Where the overlying strata is "tender'' and
liable to be broken by the blast, the kerf is cut at the
top and the blasting done at the bottom.
Coal seams often vary greatly in purity from top to
bottom but vary little or none in a horizontal plane.
If at some height in the seam there is a layer of coal
having a high ash content, the kerf is cut in this coal
and the cutting discarded—thus reducing the ash con-
tent of "run of mine" coal.
According to where the machine is arranged to make
the cut and the method by which the cutter bar is
moved, mining machines have been given such names
as "bottom cutter", "top cutter", "slabbing machines",
"mounted cutters", "shortwall machines", etc.
Mounted cutters are the faster and heavier types.
They remain on the track while cutting, move the cutter
arm into the coal by advancing on the track and swing
it from one side to the other by gearing. All the
motions are by power from the motor that drives the
chain or from a second motor. Mounted cutters may
be either bottom, center or top cutters according to
where they are arranged to make the cut.
Shortwall machines have separate trucks from which
they are removed for cutting. By means of ropes fas-
tened at one end to power driven drums on the machine
and at the other end to jack pipes placed between the
top and bottom of the room, these machines are dragged
from their trucks into and across the coal face and back
on the truck. All cutting machines are self-propelling
and move from one room to another, making a cut in
each.
After the cutting machine has left a room, the coal is
drilled and blasted and is then ready to be loaded.
There are several types of loaders, many of them
radically different. Some load the cars at the room
face and others at the entry. One type that loads at
the face is called a "Power Shovel". It has a large
scoop that is forced into the shattered coal and then
swung around and dumped into the car, much like the

Engineering
Curriculum
By Steinar Valcsdal, 34E
WHEN the Engineering student enters college
he is confronted with no fewer than twenty-
five distinct major divisions of curricula. With-
in each of these divisions there is a further array of
options and sub-options. Is it possible for any student
to know into which one of these many fields his career
is to fall? The answer is obvious. This seemingly im-
portant question has received entirely too little atten-
tion. It is a well established fact that the academically
trained engineer very rarely wins distinction in the
field for which he has schooled himself. A certain suc-
cessful Chemical Engineer received his degree in Elec-
trical Engineering. Any number of similar instances
could be mentioned. From such cases it becomes evi-
dent that almost any curriculum in engineering will
suffice as long as it is founded on fundamental prin-
ciples.
The student after his first two years in college is
required to select his major division of Engineering
and is then put through the mill. He is forced to
march lockstep with his fellow students through a
more or less definitely laid out curriculum. A curricu-
lum that seems to have for its objective the idea that
the student should gorge his memory with facts, fig-
ures, and rules about the largest possible number of
things. The engineering student is made to learn
chemical compositions of different metals, or some-
body's pet formula for buttoning up a riveted joint.
He merely learns and memorizes facts, formulae, and
rules which will be more than half forgotten and inert
before the ink is dry on his diploma. On top of this
the burden is increased by long and exacting tabula-
tions of data and numerous routine reports. The de-
sired object of stimulating scientific thinking is damp-
ened by this set up. \Yhat happens when the student
with his crowded curriculum stops to think and ana-
lyze some problem? That long laboratory report will
be late, that formula won't he memorized. The inde-
pendent thinking is really smothered under the great
tonnage of engineering facts and formulae. The mem-
orized hand book information is not of such great
importance when the engineer gets on the job where
new problems arise every day, problems that do not
come in neatly wrapped packages labelled and classi-

fied. Any professional work is a live thing related to
rapidly changing conditions, so why waste time learning
details and miscellaneous facts that can be learned far
more effectively on the job? The time in school should
be spent learning fundamental principles and in learn-
ing how to think. Every engineer specializes sooner or
later and will if he is a first class man, specialize more
and more intensely all his life. If during his under-
graduate years a firm foundation can be laid for this
specialization a very effective contribution will have
been made to his career.
Something however, should be said in defense of the
present curriculum. The administrations of the lead-
ing engineering schools realize, I believe, the above
situation and are doing a great deal to correct it. All
broadminded professors are requiring less and less
memory work and open 1xxik examinations are I&gt;ecom-
ing more and more popular. The rapid strides in en-
gineering has necessitated the crowding of material to
such an extent that it has become difficult to cover the
necessary subjects in a period of four years. Because
of this crowding the time provided for constructive
and independent thinking has been very limited. A so-
lution to the problem might be the establishment of a
five or six year course in which the student would be
given time for independent thinking. A course that
would not attempt to teach in detail any one branch of
engineering. Its graduates may not know so much but
they will have the grace of knowing what to do about it.
It must be remembered however, that it is not an easy
thing to change a curriculum overnight.

Students Taking Data in Conjunction With Research Project On
Infiltration of Air Around Windows
This article is the third of a series on interesting features in
the Engineering College. In it Prnj. Good describes the work
of the Department of Engineering Research. He has promised
to write other articles from time to time describing in detail
some of the projects of the Department.—THE EDITOR.
The Department of Engineering Research was estab-
lished in October, 1920, because of a growing appre-
ciation on the part of manufacturers of the value of
research as a means of supplying them with new pro-
ducts or better methods necessary to their continued
prosperity and because of the recognition by the Uni-
versity that she possessed facilities and personnel which
would enable her to render the manufacturers a real
research service. The Department has justified its ex-
istence, as may be seen from the fact that over one
million dollars have been paid to the University by
manufacturers for research work done through the De-
partment; last year, in spite of the general business
conditions, they paid the University over $100,000.
The reasons for the use of this research service by
the manufacturers are varied, but probably the major
one is that it is more economical to have the research
projects carried on at the University than in their own
plant. Research means the studying of nature's laws
from new angles and the manufacturer may lack the
proper equipment or the personnel with the proper
background, or both, for the proper attacking of the
problem. To acquire these may involve a prohibitive
expense or at least an expense greater than the cost of
utilizing the University's research service.
The University must have facilities for instructional
purposes as well as for fundamental research. These

are not used continuously for these purposes and are
therefore available for other use. Faculty men.
through their contact with manufacturing problems, are
enabled to keep abreast of the industrial advance so that
the arrangement is not only advantageous to the manu-
facturer, but to the University as well.
The student benefits through the improvement of the
faculty, but this is not the only way in which the stu-
dent is helped by the Department. Last year 75 dif-
ferent students were employed in connection with re-
search projects conducted through the Department.
Naturally, the type of work the undergraduate students
do is almost entirely routine in character because they
possess neither the research training nor the funda-
mental background necessary for carrying on research
projects. The compensation they receive, however, is a
considerable help to those who are working their way
through the University. The students' greatest benefit
probably comes from their contact with experienced
research workers and from their working on commer-
cial research.
Graduate students generally receive higher compen-
sation for their services because their training makes
them more valuable, though responsibility for research
work is not placed in their hands until they have dem-
onstrated their ability.
The Department also has aided students through fel-
lowships which it has administered in respect to finan-
cial arrangements. Last year there were four of these.
In normal times the Department would be undertaking
a considerably greater amount of research work than
is now the case, with a corresponding increase in the
number of students employed. In 1929 more than
twice as many students were employed as during the
past year.
The research work is divided among a number of
branches of service which underlie engineering so that
there is quite a diversity of problems. In general,
faculty members in the respective divisions have respon-
sible charge of projects in their division and arrange for
their assistants. This is done because they are more
familiar with their students and can pick the best assist-
ants. This arrangement is also an advantage to the
student as it assures him of the opportunity of being
associated with those projects which are in his special
direction of study.

WHITHER ENGINEERING EDUCATION?
In taking stock of the engineering curriculum of
today, one is immediately struck with the amount of
material which the engineering student must assimilate.
In hard, cold numbers, one hundred and forty credit
hours are required for graduation here at Michigan.
The number itself means little if the content of the
courses is unknown but in practically all upper class
courses the subjects are gone into in exhaustive detail
and the student is expected to give back to his instructor
this mass of detail on examinations.
For the student carrying a heavy school program and
at the same time engaging in some extra-curricular
activity with possibly a little recreation on the side,
the load is a heavy one. One frequently hears of a
student being "lost'' in a course. That is, after a cer-
tain point the material offered becomes a confused
jumble and defies his comprehension. From then on
he learns "mechanically" not knowing the true con-
cepts of the subject studied. Why should a student
giving the proper amount of time to his studies become
''lost" in any particular course?
The most probably answer is that the material is
given so rapidly that it does not get a chance to "sink
in" and after a certain time, more and more material
being piled upon that which was not any too well assim-
ilated, the student loses his way, gropes about and
finally accepts information not because he has reasoned
it out for himself but because his instructor says it is
so. On completing the course, this mechanical knowl-
edge seeps away very quickly and he has but little to
show for his study. Is there any way in which this
matter can be corrected? Courses in their entirety can
not be deleted from the curriculum, for almost without
exception all are important. The only other alternative
seems to be a cutting down of the material presented
in each of the courses and here the most logical thing
to do would be to omit all the detail possible and give
the student a thorough grounding in fundamentals.
Basic facts should be presented from several different
view points and the end of the semester should bring
a comprehensive review. With a good fundamental
knowledge, the student should be able to branch out
into the details of his chosen profession either in indus-
try or by graduate work.
Several times in the past year these columns have
dealt with the question of fundamental knowledge
against mechanical memory work and detail. The Open
Book Exam was advocated in preference to the memo-
rised exam. We were pleased to receive a letter last
month from Mr. R. E. Bowman. Chairman of the
Committee of Chemical Education of the American
Chemical Society, commenting on our Open Book
Exams editorials. Mr. Bowman concurs with our opin-
ions whole-heartedly and says in part, "High school
exams may later become only the contests that H. G.
Wells prophesys in 'The Shape of Things to Come',
but now they are an all important, over serious exalta-
tion of memory over reasoning power. Your editorials
should have a wider circulation down where they will
help students preparing for engineering courses and
schools." We also wonder whether the engineering
education of today does not make "an all important,
over serious exaltation'' of the necessity of presenting
a specified amount of material over a clear, concise pre-
sentation of fundamentals.
The trend seems to be more and more toward Open
Book Exams. Let us hope that the courses themselves
will tend to become Open Books through the use of
well grounded fundamentals and less detail.
ARE ENGINEERS UNCULTURED?
One must never speak of a BUNCH of students but
rather of a GROUP of students. It is considered by
the students of culture as a grievous sin. These stu-
dents become thoroughly disgusted at any infraction of
any detail in current social or literary code or any dis-
play of ignorance of the works of Beethoven or the
writings of Dumas. Is it not unfair to limit the bounds
of culture to literature, art and music when culture is
defined as the training and refining of the moral and
intellectual nature? Applied science and engineering
must surely be considered in this definition. If this is
the case have we any reason to call uncultured the man
who knows the history and theory of the heat engine,
while we hail as cultured the musician who knows the
field of harmony but knows nothing of the science that
made possible the modern pipe organ? A narrow spe-
cialist who has no knowledge of other things than his
own work cannot be considered as truly culture:l. The
artist who paints a picture before which men and
women dream is more notable than the chemist that de-
veloped for him the pigments which he used and the
textile expert who has made possible the canvas on
which he paints. The artist falls short of culture if he
holds these chemists and textile experts in contempt.
So when engineers recognize the cultural value of the
artists, philosophers and authors they should also re-
member that they give a positive contribution to culture.

City planning is each day becoming a more impor-
tant branch of city government and field for the civil
engineer. The many problems that arise in this field
are the type for a civil engineer to handle as they are
within his scope of training.
Many of the large cities in the United States and
abroad now have City Planning Boards or committees.
The future beauty, usefulness, and expense of the city's
many projects are thoughtfully and systematically
worked out.
These Planning Boards are composed of a capable
and experienced civil engineer whose capacity is City
Planning Engineer, an architect, a lawyer, a realtor,
a financial adviser, and a consulting engineer. Gener-
ally the board members are appointed and may serve
with or without salary, although the City Planning En-
gineer is a salary man. By choosing a board so com-
posed a city has a highly selective and experienced
group of citizens in many fields; men capable of carry-
ing out the large number and complexity of problems
confronted by such a board.
The duties of this committee or board are to thor-
oughly investigate, plan, design, survey, estimate costs
and finally submit a complete report of the future
growth, needs and means of improving the citys' use-
fulness and beauty. The board acts as a special and
experienced committee to present its findings to the
Board of Aldermen or other legislative body of the
city which must approve and authorize such work to
be carried on.
The city planning board must present, in its report,
data including maps, charts, photographs, perspectives,
population growth charts, traffic flow charts, statistics
of value, transit routing maps, official city plan, traffic
counts, rules governing platting of land, financial assets
and liabilities, trial capital budget, and an improvement
program.
The board must decide on the official city map and
plats in conjunction with the city surveyor. It must
formulate rules for platting and subdivision. The board
must study carefully the housing and population trends
and plan accordingly for the future growth of the city.
It must survey the traffic conditions and study the
transit problems in view of present and future condi-
City Planning

tions. It must forecast when and where new con-
struction should take place and when and where repair
or remodeling should be undertaken.
The City Planning Board plans the playgrounds and
parks and the schools and play yards. It decides when
and where to build them but leave the plans to archi-
tects. It recommends transit policies and traffic routing.
It recommends locations of new streets and boulevards
and traffice routing. The board recommends desirous
sites for parking spaces.
It decides on location of airplane landing fields and
waterfront projects and improvements. The need for
and preliminary plans of new municipal buildings, civic
center and other public buildings are decided on by the
members.
The board makes recommendations for beautifying
the city such as removal of signs, unsightly objects,
and obstructions; placing of shrubbery and trees; zon-
ing problems; types of architecture; types of streets
and harbor landscaping.
The board studies and advises on the future need of
improved or new sanitation system for sewage and
refuse disposal. It likewise investigates the water sup-
ply problems, and other municipal works.
The City Planning Board prepares a trial long term
capital budget and a statement of the financial liabilities
and assets of the city. It then works out a complete
report with recommendations as to the improvement
program on a basis of twenty to forty years and pre-
pares a trial capital budget for this program.
The board does not do all the work necessary for

TAYLOR DRYSDALE
Indianapolis, that spot in Indiana where automobile
speed records are made each year, saw the advent of
Taylor Drysdale in 1914, the future backstroke speed-
ster. Subconsciously fearing that the American Auto-
mobile Association's annual races would cramp his
style in years to come, Taylor listened to the voice of
Destiny and moved, at the age of ten, with his family
to Cleveland. There he attended grade school, skipping
grades right and left.
Following this brief
in grade school, Tay-
lor enrolled in Lake-
wood High School.
Six years ago, Tay-
lor came to Highland
Park. Michigan. High-
land Park High be-
coming his prepara-
tory school. Nothing
was heard of the boy
until his senior year
when he suddenly
burst forth as a prom-
ising backstroke swim-
mer, winning the De-
troit City High School
Championship in the
100-yard backstroke
class.
Taylor's present Alma Mater saw the arrival of
freshman Drysdale, age sixteen, three years ago.
Taylor, thinking to further evade Davy Jones .and
Minnie The Mermaid, Taylor always feared gals, went
out for the freshman swimming team, winning the 50-
yard backstroke in the frosh tryout. Then, as a mem-
ber of the swimming team, he won the following races:
He helped win the State Senior A. A. U. 300-yard
Medley Swim and broke the state record in his part of
the race, the same night winning the National Junior
A. A. U. 220-yard breaststroke, also breaking the rec-
ord. The State Senior A. A. U. 150-yard backstroke
followed the Junior State A. A. U. 220-yard free-style
and another record was smashed.
Taylor holds the Big Ten Championship in the 150-
yard backstroke and the Intercollegiate Championship,
plus many others, too numerous to give in the space
allotted this column.
Taylor Drysdale, the swimming mechanical engineer,
is a member of Triangles, and the Vulcans. This year
he has pledged the Alpha Kappa Lambda fraternity.

DRYSDALE
DE FOREST EVELAND
Missouri, the state of flaxon-topped wheat and straw-
colored corn silk, back in 1910, first welcomed Eve-
land, the blond haired, future basketball player of the
University of Michigan. Evie enjoys competition, but
it was going a bit too far to have both the wheat and
the corn rival him in the matter of color schemes; so
at an early age, Evie, accompanied by his family, moved
to Detroit.
Hutchin's Interme-
diate occupied Evie's
attention for a few
short years, and then
came the time to
attend Northwestern
High School. He
played basketball there
in his senior year, the
team winning both the
city and state cham-
pionships. Evie was,
furthermore, picked
the all-state center.
He, the treasurer of
his senior class, grad-
uated with a Cum
Lmtda diploma.
Evie came to Mich-
EVELAND igan with the original
intention of becoming
an engineer. Just before classifying, however, he
changed his mind and enrolled in the Literary College.
After a year of treading the walks on the west side of
the campus, Evie was saved for posterity when he
changed his mind and became for once and for all, a
student in our honored Engineering College.
Evie has been playing basketball for three years, and
last year was captain of the basketball team. He also
plays an excellent game of tennis. In fact, all sports
greatly interest Evie, from organized varsity contests
to hiking and camping.
Last year, Evie was president of the Trigons. This
year he is president of Tan Beta Pi, and is a member of
Michigamua. He is also on the Undergraduate Council.
Evie's interest in the members of the weaker sex in-
creases proportionately with the time he spends here.
It is said that he casts his eyes around and investigates
all likely possibilities; but it is not our duty to investi-
gate his private life. A closing word, interested readers,
'.'damsel chasing" has always been an honored pursuit;
so why should we make merry with Evie?

Detecting Noise With Meters
The public is becoming increasingly noise conscious
as is evidenced by the almost universal use of helical
gears and better insulated bodies in automobile con-
struction; of silent gears and rubber insulated wheels
in street cars; and of many examples of silent equip-
ment. With such a trend it is natural that meters
should be devised to detect noise and sound.
Sound in the physical sense is a form of energy
which stimulates our auditory sense, whereas noise im-
plies annoyance and may be defined as undesirable
sound. These are both transmitted to our ears by the
air. in which it occurs as a succession of waves each
containing a region of compression and one of rare-
faction. 1 lowever. all speech and most sounds are
complex and require a delicate mechanism for detection.
The human ear consisting of an elatorate mechanism
serves this purpose. Three major parts comprise this
ear: (1) the outer ear which collects the sound. (2)
the middle which acts as a transformer, and (3) the
inner ear where the sound is analyzed by a system of
nerves.
Obviously a meter which is set to act in this capacity
must be of a delicate nature. Such meters having un-
told value have been developed. They consist of high
quality vacuum tube amplifiers which amplify the vol-
tages generated by sensitive microphones. A Calibrated
meter measures the output and gives the intensity of
the sound in the microphone. For complex sounds an
analyzer is used, as in the ear, which divides the sound
into its various components and the frequency thereof.
Such an analysis of a machine is often valuable in giv-
ing clues as to the source of the noise.
It is impossible to design a meter which will dupli-
cate all the functions of the ear and so much care must
be given in designing the meter for its particular pur-
pose. Precautions must also be taken to eliminate the
effects of standing waves, reflections, and extraneoi^
noises.
The Relation of Windows to Air Conditioning
It is generally becoming recognized that the econom-
ical side of a problem is quite as important as the prac-
ticability and so it is with this in view that we ap-
proach the problem of home air conditioning.
The savings made in fuel by the use of storm win-
dows is well known but with the advent of refrigera-
tion in air conditioning, the economies possible by the
use of windows which will screen out the infra-red
energy in sunlight is not so generally known. In a
recent paper prepared by W. \V. Shaver, of the Corn-
ing Glass Works, it was shown that the heat energy
entering through windows is due not only to the light
transmitted but also to the absorbed heat, a great por-
tion of which is dissipated into the room. Further-
more, a great portion of this is due to the invisible part
of the spectrum which comprises 56 per cent of the
energy in sunlight. Evidently then, a glass which will
transmit a great portion of the visible light and exclude
the greater portion of the invisible radiant energy in
sunlight will be the most efficient.
Heat absorbing glasses have now been developed
which aid greatly in this problem. Due to the fact that
these glasses absorb considerable heat they can not be
used as single windows but when used in a double win-
dow with the heat absorbing glass on the outside and
ordinary window glass on the inside their full benefit
is gained. L'sed in this manner the glass acts as a filter
in removing the greater portion of the heat. From
figures computed for the operating conditions, it is
found that with combinations as above from 31 to 59
per cent of the energy in sunlight can be excluded and
at the same time a satisfactory amount of visible light
transmitted.

it would seem unprofitable in keeping out the heat en-
ergy and yet it is contended that the saving in summer
will more than compensate for such, by necessitating a
smaller and more economical refrigeration unit.
Thermostatic Bimetal Design
In many types of temperature indicating and control-
ling devices, thermostatic bimetal has proved to be a
reliable material for the temperature sensitive element.
To meet the wide variety of movements required, many
shapes of elements are used. For dial instruments re-
quiring equally spaced calibration marks, the coil form
of element is used, in which the rotation of the coil is
proportional to the length of the strip used.
Coils may be used to open or close with rise in tem-
perature, although those that open with temperature
increases are preferable due to the increased circulation
between the turns. Among the first considerations in
the design of such is the limit for maximum stress,
which can be determined by the simple beam formulas.
Particular care must be exercised to avoid a permanent
set. In selecting the component metals that go into
bimetal fabrication, it is desirable to select materials
that have as great a difference as possible in their
thermal expansion. This makes it possible to have
maximum movement of the element for any given tem-
perature change or reduce to a minimum the size of
element needed. Finally, this element is heat treated
to eliminate the stresses set up during the rolling and
forming processes.
In the growing demand for automatic devices the
use of bimetal as a temperature responsive device finds
a ready use because of the simple way of handling. A
few years ago this metal was considered a novelty, but
today it is found in dozens of devices.
The illustration shows one of the most recent uses
of bimetal elements. The helical coil, composed of two
metals, rotates as the temperature varies and in doing
so it rotates the mercury switch to which it is mechani-
cally coupled. Inside the switch the mercury globule
either makes or breaks electrical contact as it moves.
New Insulators Eliminate Radio Interference
Modern radio broadcasting has brought about a new
engineering requirement for electric power transmission
lines, namely, radio interference design. Present trans-
mission lines are known to radiate through the terri-
tory they pass a radio noise known as "transmission
fry". Field tests and observations have revealed that
this interference is particularly annoying at remote
distances from the broadcasting where sets must be
operated at full volume. Moreover, it has been found
that with different design of insulators, the voltage be-
tween line and earth must be much higher in order to
give these disturbances, or in other words, the voltage
of the line may be below that which gives interference.
Various types are now in use, the majority of which
are using insulators partially coated with a thin con-
ductor, and using specially designed metal caps. Onc
large manufacturing concern is embodying a principle
which evenly distributes the electric stresses so that no
breakdown or corona develops at the line conductor or
the tie wire. Theoretically this design approximates
equipotential surfaces between line conductor and the
pin. Later developments have slightly changed this
design for mechanical reasons.
Large sized insulators necessitated designs as shown
in the figure. The upper portion is metal and the pin
hole is lined with zinc. The metal head is not only
designed to eliminate corona formations, hut also to
keep the cantilever pull at a minimum. This design
is effective in eliminating "frying" and makes possible
satisfactory reception for receivers near transmission
lines.
In order to take care of insulators in service, adap-
ters have been developed which can be added to exist-
ing pins with favorable results. These appear in the
form of rings and shields designed to fit over the ex-
isting insulator.

Abstract by J. SineI for A. S. M. E.
Buying habits and buying favor have undergone radi-
cal changes in the last few years. Buyers and users of
products have acquired a sense of discrimination ; they
have suddenly become conscious of line. form, and
color; they have been educated, largely through the
mediums of the motion picture and advertising, to a
finer appreciation of better things—at least better look-
ing products. 1 .uying appetite is no longer satisfied
with the commonplace. This has resulted in a subcon-
scious association, in the mind of the consumer, of supe-
rior quality.
()ne of the functions of an industrial designer is to
bridge the gap between manufacturer and ultimate buyer

A Familiar Scene
TRIANGLES
Twice a year the Engineering Arch receives a thor-
ough scrubbing by the initiates of Triangles, junior
engineering honorary fraternity. Unfortunately, due
to the inclement weather at the time of this fall's initia-
tion, the job had to be limited to a dry cleaning. So on
November 15, the seven initiates spent the afternoon
at work in the snow. As a supplement to this more or
less curtailed scrubbing, some of the initiates spent
part of their time making valuable measurements on
the diagonal, the location of the Triangle plaque in the
archway, and other notable landmarks.
Henry Felker, '35, officiated as toastmaster at the
banquet that evening in honor of the initiates. Prof.
H. C. Anderson, of the mechanical engineering depart-
ment and recently appointed Director of Student Rela-
tions, was the principal speaker.
He outlined the work of his newly created position
and especially emphasized the fact that his new capacity
is purely an advisory one and not administrative or
disciplinary. Its main function is to help coordinate
the various extra-curricular campus organizations and
the alumni, he stated.
Phil Singleton, '35, president of Triangles and this
year's J-Hop Chairman, extended a welcome to the
new members. John Bellamy, '35, gave the response
in behalf of the initiates.
Those who were initiated are John Bellamy, '35. Bob
Sloane. '35, Oliver Sparks. '35, Gale Sterling, '35, Al
Knuusi, '35, John Dersch, '35. and Sam Tramontana,
'35.
College
Notes
A. S. M. E.
On Monday, November 6, the student branch of the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers presented
a German moving picture of the Leipzig Trade Fair,
an annual event which attracts many buyers of machin-
ery from all over the world. The film showed thj
progress of the machine since the beginning of civili-
zation. The methods of forging and weaving as they
are still practiced among some primitive peoples, were
:-'liown. After a graphical i.lustration of the increase
of people working in German factories, there were pic-
tures of a number of articles made by machine. The
almost human behavior of the machinery used in var-
ious industries as shown in some close-ups was aston-
ishing. Among the industries represented were th.
coal. iron, clothing, woodwork, soap, laundry, food,
building construction, transportation, baking, and candy
industries. The film ended with some general views
of the Fair.
Introductory and closing remarks were made by Fred
Kohl, '34, president of the organization.
SCABBARD AND BLADE
There were ten engineers among those initiated re-
cently into Scabbard and Blade, national honorary mili-
tary society.
They are Louis Antol, Jr., '35, Francis W. DuLyn,
'35, Alton E. Farr, '35, Don M. Ferguson. '35, Chris-
tian B. Haas, '34, Paul E. Halberstadt, '37. Sam H.
Hazelton, '35, Rufus D. Keiser, '35. Sidney Shelley.
'35. and Chase R. Teaboldt, '35.
Maj. W. E. Lay, Professor of Mechanical Engineer-
ing, Capt. Carleton B. Pierce, Professor of Roentgen-
ology, and Capt. K. L. Hallenbeck, county engineer,
were made associate members at this time.
A welcome was extended to Lieut.-Col. F. C. Rogers,
who was recently initiated into .the society, by Fred
Kohl, '34E, at the initiation banquet that evening. The
other initiates were welcomed by James R. Doty, '34E.
Donald Xorton, '35, responded for the new members. o
A. P. KARPOV
On Tuesday, November 21, the juniors and seniors
were excused by Dean Lovell to attend two lectures by
A. P. Karpov, hydro engineer with the Aluminum Corn-
Page Fourteen
December, 1933
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


9 o'clock in room 348, West Engineering Building, was
on H vdro-Electric Deltlopments. Mr. Karpov began
with a short history of water power and showed graphs
illustrating the amount of power available per person
for centuries in different countries and today. He ex-
plained the modern trend in hydro machinery design,
that is, smaller units with greater speeds and higher
efficiency. He also showed how it was commercially
worthwhile in some cases to overdevelop a water site.
For instance, if there is not enough water to furnish
a peak load continuously, it is sometimes economical
to store water and have auxiliary machinery to handle
the peak load for short periods. In these cases, it is
almost always necessary to have a steam standby sta-
tion except for such industries as the aluminum and
paper pulp, which can regulate their production to the
water supply. Slides were shown of French, German,
and Swiss pump, turbine, and generator units.
The second illustrated lecture, at 11 o'clock was on
the Design of Dams from Models. Mr. Karpov ex-
plained that a prototype model is not one in the engi-
neering sense of the word. The engineering model to
be of any value must satisfy certain "similarity condi-
tions.'' A prototype model may be an exact miniature
and not satisfy the similarity conditions. For this reason
it is not useful for engineering purposes. The engi-
neering model satisfies certain set conditions which spe-
cify the relations it must bear to the prototype. The
conditions embrace such characteristics as dimensions,
construction, material, and forces. The problem of
finding a material which will be in accord with the con-
ditions is more difficult than it might at first appear.
The Aluminum Company of America spent a year and
three months searching for a satisfactory material for
one of their models.
There were numerous slides of various models of
dams such as the Boulder Dam, now in the process of
construction, and views of the testing and measuring
apparatus used on these models.
TAU BETA PI
Robert R. McMath. '13E. of the McMath-Hulbert
Observatory of the University of Michigan, was the
principal speaker at the Tau Beta Pi dinner held on
November 14 in honor of the fall initiates. For the
past eight years, Mr. McMath has been interested in
astronomy and especially in the development of a pro-
cess for taking moving pictures showing the celestial
bodies in motion. He spoke about this process and as
an adjunct to his verbal presentation, he showed two
reels of the camera mechanisms, the observatory, some
views of the moon rotating, and of last year's eclipse
of the sun, taken by the University of Michigan Expe-
dition at Fryeburg, Maine. These two reels, which
were displayed at the Century of Progress Exposition
during the summer, vividly showed the sun's corona
and the rotation of the moon about its axis. This is

Robert R. McMath
the only motion picture ever taken of an eclipse.
Mr. McMath was introduced by Prof. A. D. Moore
of the electrical engineering department, who officiated
as toastmaster. A giant Tau Beta Pi key, some two
feet long, just completed by Peter Van Wingen, '33,
was shown for the first time. This replica is to "hang
in the lobby of the East Engineering Building as a
companion to the plaque which is now in the West
Engineering Building.
Fred Kohl, '34, welcomed the new members, and
William Elmer, '34, responded in their behalf.
There were 25 seniors and three juniors initiated.
The seniors were chosen from the upper quarter of
their class, while the junior selection was restricted to
the upper eighth.
The seniors are Kenneth Rowland, Kenneth Roe.
Walter Mikelson, Robert Merritt, Richard Wilcox.
William Elmer, Auguste Hershey, Joseph Bennett.
Ronald Culver, Richard Liskow, Robert Harrison.
Frank Highley, Wesley McMullen, Jack Salmon, Har-
old Legatski, Tso Fong Poon, Martin Holben, William
Kugler, John Spoden, Louis Westover, Julio Yglesias,
John Ainslee, Adrian Broggini, John Brown, and
Parker Cox.
The juniors were Maurice Demers, Joe Wagner, and
Henry Merker.
November must be the choice month for initiations,
if this column is a fair indication. This list, however,
is not a complete chronicle of the engineering initia-
tions. In next month's issue the list will be completed,
and in addition, all the extra-curricula activities open
to second-semester engineering freshmen will be de-
scribed, including such information as we think will
prove of interest to those who intend to participate
in them.

tleman rose to his feet, coughed and cleared his throat.
He beamed over his spectacles. He looked kindly at
the group of a thousand men. How eager and ex-
pectant they looked. The elderly gentleman felt a lump

He wiped a tear from his eye and the road gang de-
parted from Sing Sing to work on the new state high-

JUNIORS PLEASE NOTE
Do hot attend more than a third of your recitations.
Show your instructors you are real grown up upper-

Ting-a-ling! The phone rings in Professor Moore's
study. Miss Fox, the ambidextrous young secretary,
answers it. "You are wanted on the phone, Professor
Moore." "Right!" says Professor Moore, picking up
the portable typewriter and putting it to his ear. "Hey,
Miss Jones, I'm not connected," shouts the professor.
"Try using the phone," answers back Miss Fox.
"Hello, hello, this is the Y. W. C. A. What? No, I'm
wrong, the college. Oh yes, you're right. Why, hello,
Professor Mullins, how are you? Haven't seen you in
years? What? I left my coat at your house last night
after the dinner party? Why, Mullins, I have my coat
here in the office! What ? Your coat ? Oh! Surely. Well,
fine, I'll meet you in half an hour at the Co-op and
we'll exchange. Sure sorry I made the
error, Mullins. Goodbye."
Professor Moore throws the phone
receiver into the waste-basket and puts
the burning end of his pipe into his
mouth. "Miss White, will you please
make a notation that I am to meet
Professor Mullins in about thirty min-
utes at the stock exchange?"
"Surely," answers Miss Fox. "But
Professor, you have a psychology class
due in ten minutes."
"Thanks, Miss Lane," answers the
professor, pulling off his tie and start-
ing for the gymnasium.
Three years later Prof. Moore meets
Prof. Mullins at the post office and re-
turns to him the pair of rubbers.

If you take somebody's life,
It's a sin.
If you love somebody's wife,
It's a sin.
If you drink or smoke or chew,
Or take what's not your due,
With heaven you are through,
For it's a sin.
If you play around with dice,
It's a sin.
If you don't treat others nice,
It's a sin.
If this sort of life seems dry,
And you feel you'd rather die,
Suicide you cannot try,
For it's a sin.
The Man Who Got Away With It
Once there was a Student Engineer who went on a
Glorious Toot and when Monday Morning rolled
around and the Hang-over had passed away he found
he had Received a Little Note from the Dean who
wanted to See him Right Away. So Fearing the Worst
and Putting on a Long Face, which wasn't hard to do,
he presented himself at the Dean's Office and after an
Hour or Two he was Ushered into the Presence.
The Dean was very Stern and he gave the Engineer
the Once-Over through his big Thick-Rimmed Glasses
as if he were Something that had just Crawled Out
from under a Stone and he Proceeded to say that there
had been Certain Complaints and he made it Very
Emphatic that Such Conduct would not be Tolerated
and that the Engineer might Consider himself Kicked
Out.
But the Engineer had been in the Fog all Week-end
and he wanted to Know what he had done that was
So Terrible so the Dean told him that he had Been
Chasing an Old Maid around the Park and that at the
Time he was wearing Not Much of Anything except
a Necktie and a Very Evil Look.
Then it All came back to the Engi-
neer and he Smiled and Said Hell Yes
and that he'd have Caught her too if he
hadn't stopped to Watch the Dean try
to Convince a Cigar Store Indian that
he ought to take a Shower Bath in the
Fountain. And then the Dean suddenly
Remembered where it was he had Seen
the Engineer before and he got all
Embarrassed and Red in the Face and
finally he Grinned Sheepishly and Said
that there must be a Mistake Some-
where and that After All What-The-
Hell. So they Shook hands and the
Engineer went his Way.

familiar steam shovel. However, the mine shovel is
less than five feet high but can reach fifteen feet in any
direction. Other loaders make use of conveyors, with
a gathering device to pull the coal onto the front con-
veyor while the rear conveyor discharges it into the
car. The conveyors may be swung both vertically and
horizontally so that coal may he picked up anywhere
along the room face and discharged into a car on the
track.
Like cutting machines, loaders are also self-propelled.
Some have wheels and move about on the track, while
others have chain treads and can travel either on or off
the track.
To save the expense of taking up bottom rock in the
rooms where the coal is too low to admit a car, con-
veyors are used to carry the coal from the face of the
room to the car in the entry. These conveyors are of
the belt, chain or shaker type and are loaded at the face
by hand shovelers except that the shaker conveyor may
be fitted with a shovel known as a "Duckbill" by means
of which it is mechanically loaded.
As the cars are loaded they are hauled by small elec-
tric locomotives to a switch track or "parting" where
a train or "trip'' is made up to be hauled to the shaft
bottom. Either no trolley wire at all is hung in a room
or it is only run in for a short distance and the loco-
motive, when going beyond the end of the trolley wire,
receives its power from a storage battery carried on its
deck or receives it through a cable reel mounted on the
locomotive.
When the locomotive reaches the end of the trolley
wire, the end of the cable is attached to the wire and if
it is a double conductor cable the second conductor is
attached to a rail. As the locomotive advances the
cable is unwound automatically and laid along the track.
When the locomotive returns, the reel—driven by a
small motor—winds up the cable. Krom the end of the
trolley wire to the parting a trolley pole is use, These
"gathering" locomotives both haul the loaded cars from
the loading point to the parting and return the empty
cars to the loading point.
Several gathering locomotives may bring loaded cars
to the same parting. l lere the cars are coupled together
in long trips and hauled to the shaft bottom by much
faster and larger locomotives. These main line hauls
are often several miles long and while a gathering loco-
motive may weigh from four tons to eight tons, a main
line locomotive may weigh as much as thirty tons and
have 360 horsepower.
Track gauges are less than the standard railroad
gauge of 56}/2 inches. The most common coal mine
track gauge is 42 inches, although many mines have 36-.
44- or 48-inch gauge tracks.
At the shaft bottom the cars in some mines are placed
on a cage, one at a time, and hoisted up the shaft. The
shafts are double and one cage is descending while the
other is ascending. In other mines the cars are run
through a "rotary dump", which turns them upside
down from one to three at a time. From the dump the
coal is carried to a large rectangular bucket or "skip'',
which is large enough to hold the coal from several
mine cars. The loaded skip is hoisted up one side of
the shaft while at the same time an empty skip is de-
scending in the other side.
At the top of the shaft the coal is dumped and han-
dled as may be necessary for the market for which it
is intended.
This description of a coal mine does not apply to
every mine. Many variations will be found but it does
represent the methods most commonly used in a mod-
ern mechanized shaft mine.

of his products. In achieving this end, he must of
necessity consider such factors of preference as conve-
nience, utility, beauty, appeal, economy in manufacture
and sale, competition, resistance, and price. Many of
these points of influence originate with the manufac-
turer. Appearance, however, originates with the de-
signer.
The industrial designer, while he does not profess to
know engineering, often senses the appropriate mechan-
ical application for the job. Admittedly he is an artist,
a designer, yet his efforts reflect the sum total of the
practical commercial phases of the problem as well as an
aesthetic approach. His conception and expression of
line, form, and color are natural evolutions of the re-
quirements of the job.
It is a matter of common interest to achieve a result
that reflects credit alike to engineer and designer. 1 f
it were a matter solely of surface-design treatment, the
designer is then supreme. When we are dealing with
functional devices and the limitations they impose upon
the designer's efforts, then the utmost collaboration be-
tween engineer and designer is not only desirable but
absolutely essential. In any such problem there are
numerous factors to be reconciled, angles of approach
to be satisfactorily treated, practical considerations rec-
ognized. In other words, a working basis should be
established between the plant engineers and the de-
signer.
When we look at the products of industry, we see
ample evidence of excellent designing talent on the
part of the engineer. Indeed, the outstanding contri-
butions in the way of significant form in products must
be credited to the engineer and not to the artist. Then
why the need for the artist in industry if the outstand-
ing developments in exterior appearance are the work
of the engineers? Simply because the division of labor
has been extended. It is too much to expect the engi-
neer not only to design the functional units and pro-
cesses of a machine, but to give it adequate external
form as well, because the engineer is not always an

artist. Frequently the engineer is an artist, and then
we can rely on him to provide his product with an ex-
terior expression of good grace and proportion. The
purpose of the artist in industry is not to usurp any of
the engineer's functions, but rather to supplement them.
The engineer thinks primarily of interior functioning
forms, while the artist thinks in terms of externals.
Consequently, if the engineer-designer and the artist-
designer can coordinate their talents, we are likely to
get hetter products in the future than we have done in
the past.
We are just at the inception of this association of
engineer and artist in American industry, and it is per-
haps too soon to make any claims for the success of the
experiment. It is to be presumed, however, that when
the artist brings an understanding of fundamental struc-
tural requirement and an appreciation of engineer's diffi-
culties to his new task, we can look for excellent results
from the union of the engineer's and the artist's talents.

These four boosters exhaust into a surface condenser

CITY PLANNING
(Continued from Page 10)
worked out in book form with sufficient copies to sup-
ply various civic organizations and the citizens. The
program should be arranged so that it covers a time
of from twenty to forty years and the various improve-
ments for each period of two to five years are set down
in schedule and the expense itemized for that time.
Just a list of recommendations is not satisfactory, but
some schedule of completion of improvements is neces-
sary.
The board must not deal in generalities but must have
everything coordinated, completed, and thoroughly re-
viewed with opinions from various sides. There should
be facts and specific recommendations as far as prog-
nostication and estimating will permit.
Many cities have regretted the lack of proper city
planning and now are correcting the many mistakes of
haphazard judgment of years back by great expendi-
ture of public funds. A well planned and modern city
with gradual tax expenditures and steady tax rate leads
to more civic pride and harmony than a poorly planned,
congested and unattractive city wit ban erratic tax
burden.
It can now be readily seen that the civil engineer is of
vital importance to city planning and later in the super-
vising and completion of these plans, and that city plan-
ning is today an important part of a municipal govern-
ment program.

of the electorate must he capable of understanding
many of the major engineering problems which the
government undertakes. He cited the Hoover Dam
the Tennessee Valley project as examples of some of
the complex modern problems which the majority of
the people understand very little. The engineer on the
other hand is especially fitted to cope with such prob-
lems, he added.
The gradual development of natural resources and
the growing inter-dependence of economic factors he
offered as reasons to account for the present position
of the partially socialized government. This modern
system of government he contrasted with the old
laissez fairc type of government, which exerted little
or no control over the individuals' actions.
Sigma Rho Tau was praised by Prof. Menefee for
enabling the engineer to speak as well as think.
A. S. M. E. ANNUAL MEETING
The University of Michigan was well represented at
. the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers held in New York City, December
4-8. The Michigan delegation included Prof. O. W.
Buston, director of the Engineering Shops, Prof. L.
Thomassen of the Chemical Engineering department.
E. E. Weibel of the department of engineering me-
chanics, C. E. Kraus, Guy Verse. Stewart Way, and
D. M. McCutcheon. The program of the meeting other
than purely business and administrative matters, in-
cluded the presentation of papers in the different divi-
sions of the Society.
The three individual papers of the Michigan group
were Studies in Photoelastic Stress Determination by
E. E. Weibel. Elastic Properties of Steel at High Tem-
peratures, by Guy Verse, and the Rending of Circular
Plates ii'ilh large Deflection, by Stewart Way.
On December 7, the Machine Shop Division of the
Society held a celebration at the Stevens Institute of
Technology, in Hoboken, in honor of Frederick W.
Taylor, who first introduced the principle of scientific
management and who is author of the classical work
On the Art of Cutting Metals. On the program that
day, under the auspices of the Special Research Com-
mittee on the Cutting of Metals, there were joint papers
by some of the Michigan delegates. The first was the
Performance of Cutting 1'luids in Saicing, by Prof.
O. W. Boston and C. E. Kraus. The second, X-Ray

The group, after an afternoon spent in inspecting
the two plants, were the dinner guests of the Detroit
section of the A. I. Ch. E. Mr. Bull, a prominent
Detroit chemical engineer, spoke on "Rubber and Its
Applications in Detroit." ()ur own chemical profes-
sors, not to be outdone, added to the fun and interest
by giving short talks. Needless to say, the interest
shown by the student branch was manifest in the large
group that took advantage of this opportunity to in-
spect two modern industrial plants.
A. I. Ch. E.
Dr. Benjamin T. Brooks, a consulting chemical en-
gineer from New York, spoke before the student branch
of American Institute of Chemical Engineers Wednes-
day evening, November 15. "The refining of petrol-
eum and the extracting of its various constituents for
industrial purposes is still in a comparatively infant
stage." said Dr. Brooks. Only yesterday, petroleum
was refined and "cracked" by wasteful and dangerous
methods; but the purification of petroleum and the
processes by which it is "cracked" today are but slightly
superior, he went on to say.
The talk was of especial interest to members of the
student branch of the A. I. Ch. E., not only because of
the lantern slides that Dr. Brooks projected, illustrating
the growth of petroleum refining in the past ten years;
but because the memlrers were able to listen to and later
converse with a prominent and active member of the
chemical engineering profession.
W. H. Bradley, the president of the student branch,
introduced Dr. Brooks.
OUR ATHLETES
Xow that the past football season is rapidly becom-
ing a fond memory, and the attention of the student
sport fans is turning to other games, we have just
noticed an interesting item in connection with the engi-
neering representatives in the field of athletics. We
note first that there are two engineers listed among this
year's football letter-men. This in itself is not par-
ticularly awe-inspiring. The interesting thing is that
both of these two men were outstanding on this end
of the campus in other activities, notably politics.
Whether participation in football is instrumental in
being elected to class offices, or whether it is a coninci-
dence that Louis W. Westover, '34, and Tage (). Jacob-
son, '35, are the only two engineers among the letter-
men and at the same time presidents of two classes,
we do not know. I.ouis Westover. is also a Tau Beta,

"Cellophane" Slitting Machine


at Elevated
Temperatures

Testing for "Creep" of Metals
By Claude L Clark, Research Engineer
Department of Engineering Research
DURING the past ten years rapid progress has
been made in the commercial use of metals at
higher operating temperatures and pressures.
While this is true in many industries, it is particularly
so in the central station and petroleum fields. The
Operating temperatures and pressures in the liquid phase
cracking units have increased from 800 F. and 400 to
700 pounds in 1920 to 900°F. and 750 to 1000 pounds
at the present time. In the vapor phase units, temper-
atures of 1050 to 1150°F. and pressures up to 400
lxmnds are now in use. Likewise in the central sta-
tions, steam temperatures of 850°F. are now common
and one experimental unit has been operating with n
steam temperature of 1000°F.
When it is considered that an appreciable difference
always exists between the metal temperature and the
oil or steam temperature, it is evident that metal tem-
peratures of 1000 to 1200 or 1300°F. are not at all
uncommon even under ideal conditions. Under unfav-
orable conditions produced through the formation of
either scale or coke within the tube, metal temperatures
higher than these are often obtained, and may in cer-
tain cases even approach the temperature of the flame
with which the metal is in contact.
These severe operating conditions have necessitated
the development of heat-resisting alloy steels which
have a good resistance to a phenomenon known as creep.
This term can best be defined by comparing the be-
havior of steel at room temperature with that at elevated
temperatures. At room temperature all grades of steel,
as well as most non-ferrous metals and alloys, may be
considered for all practical purposes as being nearly
perfect elastic bodies. Generally, if they be subjected
to any stress below the elastic or proportional limit, the
resulting strain or deformation will be proportional to
the applied stress and will be independent of time. If,
for example, a piece of steel one inch in length be sub-
jected to a tensile stress of 10,000 pounds, it will un-
dergo an increase in length of approximately 0.000333
inches and regardless of the length of time this stress,
is maintained, the deformation will remain constant at
this amount, showing no tendency to increase with time.
At elevated temperatures metals and alloys lose their
elastic behavior and become plastic. At these tempera-
tures an apparent elastic deformation occurs upon the
application of a load below the elastic or proportional
limit, but unlike the conditions at room temperature,
this deformation is not independent of time, but in-
creases as the time of application of load is increased.
This increase in elongation with time under a constant
stress is what is now commonly known as "creep".
In order to design apparatus for high temperature
service it is necessary to first determine what creep rate
is permissible and then to select the proper material to
give a creep rate equal to or below the allowable one.
The determination of the creep characteristics of a ma-
terial is a long and tedious task which requires the use
of special equipment. The Department of Engineering
Research has a well-equipped laboratory for this pur-
pose, which is one of the largest of its kind in this coun-
try, if not in the world. A view of one battery of six-
teen creep testing units is shown in Figure 1.
Each unit consists of three essential parts: a mech-
anism for maintaining a constant load, a furnace for
holding the specimen at the desired temperature, and an
extensometer system for measuring the deformation or
creep. The stress is applied through a single lever sys-
tem with a 24:1 ratio. In order to eliminate vibration,
each lever is equipped with a dash pot. An electric
furnace is used for heating the specimen and each fur-
nace is equipped with an individual automatic tempera-
ture controller for maintaining the temperature con-
stant to within ±2°F.
Since the amount of creep to be considered is very
small, being of the order of one millionth of an inch
per hour, it is necessary to have a very sensitive exten-
someter system. In our laboratories, an optical system
is used which is sensitive to 2.8 millionths of an
inch.
As a result of the work which has been done at the
University, several steels with superior creep resistance
have been developed.

The Profilograph
An Instrument for Measuring Surface
Roughness
The Profilograph
By E. J. Abbott:;
ONE by one the elements of engineering are taken
from the realm of human judgment and placed
in the list of measurable quantities. The old
fashioned heat treater has been replaced by pyrometers
reading in degrees, the noise inspector is being replaced
by sound measuring instruments reading in decibels,
and now the question "How smooth is smooth?" is being
answered by a new instrument called a Profilograph
(profile-o-graph) which measures surface irregularities
in millionths of an inch. This instrument was devel-
oped in the Physics Laboratory of the University in
connection with projects undertaken through the De-
partment of Engineering Research for industrial con-
cerns.
Principle of Profilogruph
As shown in Figure 1 the principle of the instru-
ment is very simple. A specimen of the surface to be
measured is mounted on a small carriage. Resting very
lightly on the surface is a very sharp diamond l»int
which moves up and down over the profile as the speci-
men is moved horizontally. The movements of the
tracer point are magnified and recorded on a strip of
sensitized paper. In this way enlarged record of
a section of profile of the surface is obtained. A
sketch of the actual set-up is shown in Figure 2.
Characteristics of Machined Surfaces and Their
Relation to Profile Records
The height of the irregularities which constitute the
roughness of a well finished surface is surprisingly
small. For example, a finely ground surface such as a
wrist pin shows irregularities of the order of 25 mil-
lionths of an inch in height, and these irregularities are
clearly visible to the naked eye. Apparently this is due
to the fact that the spacing of the peaks and valleys is
much greater than their height. Few of the peaks or
valleys are closer together than half a thousandth (500
millionths) and all of the larger valleys are several
thousandths of an inch in width. Consequently, when
the profiles are recorded in their true proportions, the
peaks and valleys appear very blunt indeed, and the
curvatures of the surface are gentle. This does not
seem unreasonable when one thinks of the problem of
trying to obtain and maintain the edge of a cutting tool
so that it would appear sharp in terms of millionths of
an inch.
This bluntness of the profile curves is of great ad-
vantage to our instrument in two ways: first, the re-
quirements of sharpness of the tracer point are not so
extreme; and second, the record can be compressed
horizontally in order to obtain a longer specimen of
profile without losing too much detail. The first of
these advantages is obvious. In tracing these profiles,
the important dimension is not the angle of the point,
but rather the radius of curvature of the tip. By using
a point of 60° included angle, we were able to obtain
a radius of tip of approximately .00005". Tests show
that this is amply sharp to fully bottom the vallevs of
finely ground and honed surfaces, as well as the coarser
irregularities of roughing machining operations such as
planing and boring. We anticipated that there would
be overhanging sections of profile, and narrow crevices
which would not be faithfully recorded, but these should
show as steep lines and sharp cusps on the record, and
none of these have been observed, from which we con-
clude that such distortion in the record is negligible.

zontal magnification is determined by the ratio of
drum speed to carriage travel. These can be adjusted
independently, and while we have made records with the
vertical magnification equal to the horizontal so that the
profiles were shown in true proportion, it is usually
more practical to use smaller horizontal magnification.
The advantage of using a combination of high ver-
tical magnification with low horizontal magnification
can best be appreciated by those who have worked with
high magnification microscopes (above 1000X). In
such microscopic work the depth of focus and the field
of view are so small that it is hard to get much of an
idea of the general character of the surface. If the
1 orizontal magnification of the records accompany-
ing this article were the same as the vertical, the
profile now occupying a tenth of an inch horizontally
would extend across the whole page, and you can
imagine the difficulty of trying to rate the rougher sur-
faces on the basis of such short specimens.
The records shown here were all taken with the same
combination of magnifications, namely vertical 2000,
horizontal 30. This scale gives a reasonable height of
record on smooth surfaces, and allows the height of
irregularities to be estimated to the nearest millionth of
an inch. At the same time it covers a distance on the
sample of approximately j4 inch, which seems to be a
reasonable size of specimen. While the horizontal
crowding is a factor of 67, most of the individual irreg-
ularities can be clearly distinguished. To show the pro-
files in their true proportions it would be necessary to
draw out these records horizontally to about 40 feet.
Figure 4 shows a pair of traces made over the same
section of profile of a sample of honed cylinder bore.
The records are slightly displaced, but careful inspec-
tion shows that each of the individual irregularities is
repeated with the utmost fidelity. Test runs using an
optical flat as specimen, show lines which appear per-
fectly straight within the accuracy of measurement cor-
responding to one millionth of an inch.
Examples of Profilograph Records
The records of Figure 3 were chosen to illustrate
some of the practical aspects of this type of measure-
ment. These records are not intended to prove the

Engineering Education
A Student's Viewpoint
By A. Francis Klute, '35 E
MUCH has been said concerning the place of cul-
tural subjects in engineering curriculums by
educators and practicing engineers. In a paper
of this nature no definite conclusion can l&gt;e drawn; but
some idea of the importance of culture from a concen-
sus of opinion which is presented here. A definite rela-
tionship, however, can be traced between the abilities
attained in the study of the liberal arts and sciences,
and the actual practice of engineering in later life. For
the sake of comparison we shall consider all our mental
abilities and talents as tools which we need to produce
our life's work.
We have chosen an institution of higher learning to
provide us with the necessary tools and a knowledge of
the use of these tools. And since it is humanly impos-
sible in the course of a few short years to acquire very
many tools, we have narrowed ourselves down to the
profession of engineering. At the outset we are plunged
into a rigorous study of the sciences which deal mostly
with the theory of engineering practice. l,ut after we
think a bit about ourselves and our surroundings we
find it is necessary to learn more than the things taught
in the classroom in order to acquire our tools for life.
We find sooner or later that we have to learn to deal
with that variable quantity, human nature. Mr. Veal,
the manager of research for the Society of Automotive
Engineers, stated in a recent journal published by the
society that, "To live completely we must understand
not only the laws of nature, but also the laws of human
nature". We learn after a short time away from the
protection of home and our close circle of friends that
this world is not all made up of people who think rea-
sonably and logically, and who have the courage of their
convictions; but that it is a conglomerate mass of indi-
viduals who differ very greatly from each other in their
thoughts and their consequent acts. Our Alma Mater
should teach us this understanding of the human ele-
ment which enters into our professional life as well as
our personal life.
( hir profession deals more closely with humanity than
one is led to believe in his classroom and laboratory
work. Engineering is defined as "that art of organizing
and directing men and controlling the forces and mate-
rials of nature for the benefit of the human race". If
we are to be the benefactors of our fellow human be-
ings we must try to understand their likes, dislikes, their
many idiosyncrasies and especially their needs, mate-
rially and socially.
The ability to solve engineering problems is only u
tool which we need as members of the profession. We
also need some tools to enable us to obtain a good sub-
stantial living for ourselves and our future families. In
this modern world it is believed that it is the right of
every man to hold a position which will make possible
some luxuries and means of education besides the neces-
sities of life for himself and his dependents. We must
be trained to take our places in business and industry
as individuals and compete with other men of the pro-
fession on an equitable basis.
As members of future adult society we must l&gt;e able
to mix with people in other walks of life and to con-
verse and be sociable with them and always be at our
ease. We must also learn how to spend our leisure i&gt;.i
a profitable manner as is befitting educated gentlemen.
This would require some training in culture and the
appreciation of the Arts and Sciences. We should at-
tain a taste for good literature as one attains a taste
for certain palatable delicacies.
In summarizing what we should expect from a for-
mal education in engineering we may say that it should
furnish us with the tools and a knowledge of their use
which we need first, as meml&gt;ers of the profession, sec-
ond, as members of society and third, as individuals.
There are certain qualities which a student must pos-
sess in order to be successful in the study and practice
of engineering science. It is believed that some apti-
tude must be shown for mathematics and the labora-
tory sciences, a capability of expressing himself clearly
by the written and spoken language, a certain eagerness
concerning mechanical things and an intense intellectual
curiosity which promotes mental health. Besides these
of course he must have good health to endure the long
hours of concentrated study. The prospective student
engineer is also expected to have gained some proficiency
in the classical studies of history, rhetoric and the lan-
guages to provide a foundation for his pursuit of cul-
ture in the University as well as to fortify his technical
courses.
A constructive and humanizing hobby which diverts
us for a portion of our time each week will do much to
promote this mental stability which is needed by every

DON W. LYON
Though Don Lyon, the architect, is not a student in
the engineering college, he has been as interested in th.
various activities of our school as the best of the engi-
neers. Naturally, since it is the Engineering Spotlight's
duty to cast praise where praise is due, we deemed it
necessary to include Don on our list.
Don was born in Vermillion, South Dakota, the home
of the University of South Dakota. His activities in
high school ranged
from a fiddler in the
high school orchestra
to the salutatorian of
his graduating class.
He was on the debat-
ing team, and he won
the district oratorical
contest and the dis-
trict extemporaneous
contest—his father is
a speech professor at
the University of
South Dakota. Don
was the business man-
ager of his school
paper. a member of
the glee club, an offi-
cer in the Hi-Y, and
was interested in dra-
matics.
Don entered the University of South Dakota as a
mechanical engineer. There he become a charter member
and the first president of Phi Eta Sigma, the honorary
freshman scholastic fraternity. Speech again inter-
ested Don, as he stepped out and became an extempo-
raneous champion.
Don, however, still had dreams about becoming an
architect. The architectural college of the .University
of Michigan caught his eye; so Don packed up and
enrolled here. Bingo!—right away Don was elected
president of the freshman class, which all goes to show
what a smooth tongue can do, brother engineers. Wish-
ing to further extend his scope of activities, Don be-
came a member of Sigma Rho Tau.
Don is a member of the Architectural Society, is the
art editor and was the national advertising manager for
the MICHIGAN TECHNIC. He was a committeemnn
for both the Slide Rule Dance and the Architects' May
Party last year. This year Don is a Senior Ball com-
mitteeman. Second Lieutenant Lyon, Infantry Reserve,
is the present treasurer of Scabbard and Blade. He is
also a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

ARTHUR H. MOSIER
Here is the story of a wrestling electrical engineer.
There is many a jumpy and jittery engineer in our en-
gineering college, especially when the old fmals start
leering in the near future, but a wrestling engineer Is
new to us. I lowever, let's get going with the story:
Art was born in Levering, Michigan. His school
life, though, began in Petoskey, the summer resort of
thousands. There Art attended two years of high
school, and in the re-
gretable words of his
younger brother, "He
didn't do a d
thing, and don't let
him make you believe
he did.'' Certainly,
gentlemen, that is a
sad state of affairs
for one so talented as
to later become a
wrestling electrical en-
gineer.
Came the Mosiers
to Ann Arbor where
Art enrolled in Ann
Arbor High. When
we questioned him
concerning his avtivi-
ties there. Art calmly
and in an offhand
manner mentioned that he "was mostly studious."
His brother, an interested onlooker to Art's interview,
gave a sickening groan, then loudly proclaimed about
the decided absurdity of such a remark.
We find, however, getting back to cold facts, that
Art was on the football squad, a member of the cross-
country team, and entered intramural wrestling in Ann
Arbor High.
As a natural result of his graduating from high
school, Art entered the engineering college as a civil
engineer, changing to an electrical engineer in his soph-
omore year.
Art has wrestled his way throughout his four years,
and this year is the captain of the team. In his fresh-
man year, he won the State A.A.U. wrestling contest
in the 145-pound class; as a sophomore, he won the
State A.A.I', wrestling match in the 155-pound class.
Last year, Art was the runner-up in the individual
contest in the Big Ten.
Art is a member of Triangles, the Vulcans, Sigma
Rho Tau, and the A.I.E.E. This year, he is on the
honor council.

The clock as it appears today
Students hurrying to and from classes give scarcely
a glance, and never a thought to the clock in the tower
of the West Engineering Annex. If they happen to
be on campus around 7:30 in the morning (rare occa-
sion) or at 5:30 in the evening, the peal of the chimes
causes no great amount of wonderment. The clock and
chimes are taken for granted, as things which have
always been.
That this is not the case is readily disclosed. A trip
to the Library files, a personal inspection of the clock
and bells and a talk with one who formerly cared for
the clock bring out the story.
When the University first opened its doors in Ann
Arbor, in September, 1841, there were seven students.
who lived in the dormitory rooms in what is now
Mason Hall. They were awakened and called to classes
by a bell in the hands of Patrick Kelly, among whose
other duties were those of janitor and assistant libra-
rian. The room rent was $2.50 per man for a term of
three months.
By 1845 there were fifty students and a larger bell
was borrowed from the Michigan Central Railroad.
This hung from an upstairs window, within reach of
the students, who often misplaced it. During President
Tappan's administration ( 1857-) the students lived in
private homes and a chapel was installed in what is now
the Registrar's office. The bell then hung from a pole
in the yard.
One night in December, some students turned it bot-
tom upwards, filled it with water and held it there until
Mow Old is the
Clock?

the water had frozen. That their hands were badly
frostbitten was of no consequence. By morning the
expansion of the ice had cracked the bell and it gave
forth discordant sounds. In '61, the boys removed the
bell from its post to a woods about a mile away. At
chapel the next morning, Dr. Tappan thanked the boys,
remarking' that the bell had been placed there for their
convenience, that the faculty had watches, and that
from now on classes would start at two minutes past
the hour instead of five minutes as had been the rule.
The next night the bell was returned and never dis-
turbed thereafter.
Steps were taken to procure a new bell, and on Octo-
ber 10, 1870, the Chronicle, the student fortnightly, an-
nounced: "The new bell has at last arrived and is a
decided improvement upon the dinner bell which has
been wickedly deceiving us several times a day for the
last two weeks.''
This bell continued in use until 1883, when the West-
minster Peal, a set of five bells so named because of
the tune they played, was placed in the west tower of
the newly erected Library. The bells were the gift of
Messrs. Hagerman, Hageler, and White, all men of
prominence, whose names can be seen on the large beil
today, together with the inscription, "Call together those
who are students of all good things both human and
divine". They were pro-
cured through the efforts
of Prof. C. K. Adams,
head of the History De-
partment and later presi-
dent of Cornell and Wis-
consin Universities.
It was not until two
years later that some
mechanical means was
acquired for ringing the
bells. In 1885 the clock
was purchased and in-
stalled in the Library
tower. It was then and
is now run by a system
of weights, requiring the
services of two janitors
two hours a week to
wind it. The Chronicle

ENGINEERS AND HUMAN RELATIONS
The Engineers have effected the destiny of the human
race more than any other profession. From the Pyri-
mids of Egypt to the present day achievements they
have played the dominant part in the lives of men.
They have made child labor unnecessary; they have
made it possible to shorten the sixteen hour day to
eight hours. The profession is dependent ulxm mass
production machine processes, technical skill. At the
present time economics and human relations are be-
coming prominent and they have proved very difficult
problems. As a result severe criticisms have been
hastily directed at the engineer. It should be remem-
bered, however, that industry has welded into single
organizations hundreds and sometimes thousands of
human beings with widely different habits of life and
thought. With this point in view it seems that the
engineering profession has been more abused for its
success in the accomplishment of its goal than any
other profession. We should not, however, feel too
exalted for the problems of Human Relations requires
a great deal of improvement.
The student of engineering should recognize this
fact and should take advantage of every possible op-
portunity to work together with his classmates and
learn some of the tricks of human nature. Extra-cur-
ricula activities provide an excellent chance for such
training and is in a certain sense almost as important
as the scholastic curriculum. Xo one can ever reach
a perfect understanding of human nature, but the more
one deals with his fellowmen the closer he will ap-
proach it. It has been said that the successful indus-
trial management of the future is going to depend
more and more upon the management of men rather
than the organization of machines. Therefore, the en-
gineer should understand men as well as they do mate-
rials and machines. We should look forward to the
day when employees and employers will strive hand in
hand to bring success to the undertaking in which thev
are engaged.
The engineer not only contrives the machine but up-
roots the lives of men and he will therefore encounter
human relations whether he wants to or not.
FINALS
Once more that semi-annual horror is almost upon
us. Those four hour, blood sweating tortures, com-
pared to which the Spanish Inquisition was child'&gt;
play, are again around the corner. They are at the
end of each semester just as surely as the twilight is at
the end of each day, so why not stop complaining about
them? See if they have any value I&gt;eside being neces-
sary to pass a course and then set out to get all the
knowledge possible from them instead of gleaning just
enough to get a passing grade.
Your first premise should be that final examina-
tions were conceived with some end in view other than
helping the professor give you a semester grade.
Maybe they weren't—but we feel particularly charitable
at the present moment. The chief argument usually
presented for a final is that it serves to correlate the
semester's work in a course. This is undoubtedly true.
Material in any course must be presented in sections
and it is often impossible for these sections to follow
one another in a logical sequence. ()ne line of thought
must be dropped temporarily, in order to present other
principles which are necessary for future work. When
the original thought is again taken up, the early work
is often hazy. At the semester's end, with the whole
course fairly well in mind, a comprehensive review
should serve to tie the various phases of the subject
together in a comprehensive whole.
Then there is the fact that relearning almost any-
thing makes it stick in the mind to a much greater
degree. Figures have been compiled showing that only
a small percentage of people retain an idea after having
studied it only once. A greater portion retain it after
having studied it twice, a still greater portion after
having studied it a third time and so on. Your original
study of a course is one attempt to grasp the subject,
your review for blue books is another and your finals
still another. Therefore, if you give your final an
honest trial, it should serve to impress the course on
your mind.
Finally there is the clearing up of obscure points
which had little meaning when originally studied. When
these points are re-studied in the light of the full course,
a great light often bursts upon a student and he sees
a reason for the inclusion of that particular point in
the course. Material presented early in a course, at
the time seemingly non-essential, is proved necessary.
Approach your finals with the idea that they are a
necessity to rounding out your courses, that your un-
derstanding of the course will be greater after having
studied for a final and that this comprehensive review
will help you to really learn the subject. If you do.
tiinals will not be merely a drudgery or duty, but a help
to a fuller knowledge—and that is, we hope, what all
students' are here for.

River Vehicle Tunnel Nears Completion
One of the latest designs of submarine tunnels is
now nearing completion between Liverlx&gt;ol and Birken-
head, Kngland. The entire tunnel extends for 2.13
miles with one mile being under water, and has an in-
ternal diameter of 44 feet.. Four approaches lead ti:
the tunnel proper which is of circular section. The
roadway consists of four traffic lanes totaling 36 feet
in width and two four feet sidewalks. One of the novel
features of the tunnel is the construction underneath
the roadway, which is comprised of three compartments
divided by two partition walls also supporting the road-
way. The two outside compartments are used for pipe-
lines and air ducts, while the center one is to be used
for some special form of transportation that may be
devised in the future.
In construction, pilot headings, 15 x 12 feet, were
completed over a distance of one mile before any other
work was begun. So accurate was the work that the
headings started from either end, met within J/2 inch.
A shield advanced by hydraulic jacks was used for the
first 1100 feet in length. To insure safety, as the upper
half was completed it was lined with cast iron segments
before the lower half was begun. Special care was
taken to make the tunnel water tight in order to avoid
a high cost of maintenance, and for this purpose ex-
ternal grouting was applied at pressures up to 120 Ibs.
per square inch through holes in the cast iron lining.
In its completed state, the roadway will be paved
with cast iron blocks embedded in a bituminous compo-
sition with the traffic lanes outlined with amber colored
rubber. The walls are faced with black glass up to a
height of seven feet.
Another novel feature of the tunnel is the lighting
system. Alternate lights are fed from alternate sources
and every tenth light from the end is fed from a plant
at the other end. Near the exits the spacing of the
lights is decreased in order to accustom the driver to
outside lighting conditions.
Apparatus for Welding Thermocouples
The ordinary thermocouples of nickel and constantin.
etc., cannot be used for determining temperatures in
engine pistons because they break due to their low elas-
ticity. As a result experiments have shown that couples
of annealed steel and constantin are most favorable for
tests at high speeds, but such a couple cannot be welded
in the voltaic arc due to the oxidizing and spitting of
the steel. The following method of welding was de-
vised by a Russian engineer for use on pvrometers to
be used on engine pistons.
The method is essentially electric welding with the
exclusion of air. One pole of the power source (pre-
ferably direct current but alternating may be used) is
connected through a fuse, knife switch, and resistance
to a terminal. The other pole is connected to a wire
dipped in a vessel of mercury and oil. The end of the
wires to be welded is twisted in a knot and rapidly
dipped in and withdrawn from the mercury. The other
end of these wires is connected to the terminal men-
tioned above. When the wire is withdrawn for an
instant an arc is formed between the wire and the mer-
cury while it is being moved through the upper layer
of oil. This arc is sufficient to weld the wires and does
so in the absence of air thus giving excellent results.
Welded Bridge Sets New Records
One of the latest achievements in construction is the
recent use of welding for bridge structures. Up to
recent times rivets were used alone but present practice
now marks welding as a capable and very efficient sub-
stitute.
The latest bridge to use such fabrication is the re-
cently completed Schlacthoff bridge in Dresden. Ger-
many, which spans the Ostra tidal channel, a flood-
water tributary of the Klbe. The structure, not unlike
many others, is composed of thirteen spans of 72J4-86
feet. Its outstanding achievement however is the
almost total use of welding and it is credited with being

fornia has a structure of 1380 feet, but a relatively
small amount of weld is used since the girders and
floor beams are of rolled sections. However, the
novelty of the Dresden bridge is the building up of the
girders and floor beams from plates in the shop by the
use of welding.
The main girders are 80 inches deep and are spaced
29J/2 feet apart, supporting a roadway of 33^ feet and
two 6]/2 ft. sidewalks. The flanges of the main girders
are welded to the web with a fillet of 7/32 inch. The
sole use of rivets in the structure is in the attaching of
stiffener plates. In view of this use of welding, some
provision must be made for expansion. This is ac-
complished by the use of rocker arms placed at the
center line of the web of the main girder. Four of these
are used, one at each of the quarter points of the bridge.
The illustration shows the type of rocker arms used.
The floor beams which are placed at 13 foot centers
are reinforced by flat iron and T-iron sections fillet
welded by hand.
One of the major difficulties encountered was in the
building up of the sections to be used. Each of these
had to be assembled before taking to the structure
proper. Due to the immensity of this job Gantry
cranes had to be used as shown in the accompanying
figure.
Worlds Largest Generators
When the Boulder Dam is completed not only will it
be the largest of its kind in this country but it will also
embody the largest generators in the world.
The contract for these generators has been given to
General Electric, Westinghouse, and Allis Chalmers.
The first two named will supply two each and tho
latter, one. The generators will be three phase, rated
at 82500 K.V.A. and designed for 50 cycle generation
at 13800 volts and 60 cycle at 16500 volts. Eventually
fifteen generators of the same rating will be installed.
Each of these machines will be 40 feet in diameter and
will weigh approximately 2,000,000 pounds, and will
require forty freight cars for transportation.
In the operation of these machines, two generators
will be used in parallel and connected to a bank of step
up transformers consisting of three 55000 K.V.A. single
phase transformers connected delta on the low voltage
side and star on the high voltage side. The power gen-
erated will be transmitted by means of two transmission
circuits operating at 275000 volts at the receiving end
from 280000 at the sending end.
Seadromes Merit Consideration
At a recent symposium on the subject of trans-
Atlantic air service it was accepted as an engineering
possibility that such service may exist within a year's
time. Among the speakers was Mr. Armstrong who
proposed the much discussed seadrome system. It was
thought improbable that a plane could land on such
floating platforms in mid-ocean except in the best of
weather. However, investigations point that it would
be entirely possible with blind flying in its now highly
developed state. Furthermore, sites for the proposed
seadromes have been chosen with due consideration of
the average weather conditions in their vicinity. It is
also believed that the most economical form of trans-
portation will be offered by operators using floating
seadromes as refueling bases.
o
Improving Airship Performance
Within the past few years airships have gained much
prominence until now they demand recognition as long
distance carriers, principally on overwater routes. As
such any improvement in their performance as to speed
and useful load will be reflected in increased econoiru.
For rigid airships of conventional design the dead
weight will amount to 55-60 per cent of the gross load,
thus leaving 45-40 per cent as useful load. With this
in view any minor change in load, or materials will not
greatly effect the ratio of the dead weight to the gross
weight. Furthermore it is this ratio which determines
the ceiling of the ship, since the maximum altitude is
that point where the ratio of the air density to the air
density at sea level equals the ratio of the dead weight
to the gross weight.
In flight an airship should be able to maintain a rea-
sonable balance between weight and buoyancy. In
American airships air-cooled condensors recover the
moisture in the fuel exhaust. However, the apparatus
is heavy and its durability is not satisfactory. An im-
provement in this method of maintaining balance would
aid considerably. One of the most promising ideas
is to place a quantity of cheap, readily available hydro-
gen inside a mantle and let it out as the airship burns
fuel. This undoubtedly would eliminate the weight of a
great deal of
equipment. The ^1^^*-^^^—^,^^^^^*.^^^.

A. S. M. E. REFUELING
The A. S. M. E. ended the year 1933 with its 8th
Annual Student-Faculty Refueling on December 7. The
event took place in the Union in the form of a dinner,
followed by a group of short talks on various phases
of engineering in other countries.
The list of speakers was headed by Dean Sadler
whose prelude, as it were, was of extreme interest to
the oncoming graduates. 1 le compared the graduate
of a few years ago whose problem was, ''Which of
these so-many companies shall I work for?" to the one
of today and tomorrow who is confronted with the task
of locating a job—selling himself. The former chose
a job in his particular line of specialization. The latter
must take what he can get. "An engineer should be
able to tackle any kind of a job," Dean Sadler said.
He ended by lauding the program which the local
branch of the A. S. M. E. had arranged.
Prof. Alexander P. Gwiazdowski, of the Shop De-
partment, continued the program with a resume of
engineering developments in Russia, Poland, and
Czechoslovakia, in a concise oration, taking up exactly
his allotted time, 15 minutes. Any report on his speech
can only hit the high spots: A picture of Russian engi-
neering in the days of the Czarist regime with its tech-
nical schools, of fine caliber but limited to a few. Soviet
Russia, after the importation of American engineers
and methods, plowing forward with its adroit faculty
for borrowing American designs and enlarging their
dimensions. Poland, a country rich in resources. The
story of its cutting tool industry being more detailed
since Prof. Gwiazdowski went there in 1921 to help
organize it. Czechoslovakia, renowned for fine steel,
exportation of shoes by the millions into this country,
superior drawing pencils known to all engineers, and
Pilsener beer, its reputed fine quality yet to be verified
by we embryo engineers.
Prof. D. M. Phelps, of the School of Business Ad-
ministration, is an economist of such modesty as to
admit that if "all the economists were laid end to end
around this globe—it might be a good thing." Fortu-
nately, they are not, so the A. S. M. E. was privileged
to hear Prof. Phelps speak on South America. He
traced briefly the economic history of South America
since the World War. The policy of the United States
of not allowing other nations to pay their debts with
what they can in the line of exchange goods, he blamed
for the South American collapse. Not only that, but
North American banks loaned money to South America
without due analysis of the possibility of repaying, he
added. South America needs capital investment, engi-
neering ability, and technical products, and these needs
cannot be fulfilled unless the United States is willing
to take goods in exchange, he concluded. Incidentally,
Prof. Phelps has just returned from South America.
Prof. E. L. Eriksen, of the Engineering Mechanics
Department, the fourth speaker, related the engineer-
ing possibilities and practice in the Scandinavian coun-
tries, principally Denmark. The life and industry of
Denmark, so he said, centers about the soil. For that
reason, almost all the engineering positions are in the
government civil service, and municipal departments.
The engineers for these positions are appointed with
the recommendation of the Engineering Society which
embraces all branches of engineering. There is only
one engineering college in Denmark, and because of
the small demand for engineers in that country, the
enrollment is limited so that there are only enough
graduates to fill the demand.
The last speaker, Prof. H. V. Rhorer, of the Politi-
cal Science Department, and former Trade Commis-
sioner of the Department of Commerce in the Philip-
pines. The Philippines he characterized as "a monu-
ment to engineering ability." It was an opportunity
for engineering pioneer work, he said. He then con-
tinued with short descriptions of some of the out-
standing engineering features of the islands. He cited
Manila Pier 7 as one of the largest in the world, and
praised the fine road system which is truly an engi-
neering feat. The equatorial rains and the swampy
nature of the lowlands make it quite a problem to con-
struct and maintain satisfactory highways. Of special
interest was his description of the rice terraces in the
Island of Luzon which extend for miles and were built
by the early inhabitants of the island without any tools
or mortars. It is estimated that the primitive men spent
1500 years in the process of building these rice terraces
which cover the mountain sides, he said. The terraces.
12,000 miles of them, were built out of stone and then
the soil was carried up there by baskets. Nbt only that,
but a system of irrigation was provided for.
"The Philippines, our most populous dependency i-
truly the result of American engineering skill," he con-
cluded.
Fred Kohl, '34, president of the local student branch,
officiated as toastmaster.
TRANSPORTATION CLUB
The Transportation Club, organized for those who
have an interest in any phase of transportation, re-
cently went to Detroit to visit the Produce Terminal
and the Central Railroad Station there. The trip, ar-
ranged by Prof. Walter Sadler, faculty adviser of the
club, was made in private cars and took up most of the
day. On Wednesday, December 13. the members of
the club were addressed by Felix W. Pawlowski, dug-

about the new 100 mile-an-hour trains.
The officers of the organization at present are Joseph
A. Bennett. 34, president, Richard McManus, 34, vice-
president, Kenneth Campbell. '34, secretary, and
Witold Malecki, '34, treasurer.
The prospective programs include trips to Jackson
and Toledo, similar to the one made in Detroit, and
a symposium. The local group is affiliated with the
Associated Traffic Clubs of America. As a member
of this nation-wide organization it enjoys all the facili-
ties of the society.
The only criterion for membership is an interest in
transportation.
PHI KAPPA PHI
Phi Kappa Phi, all campus scholastic honorary fr;i-
ternity, initiated six senior engineers among its initiates
taken from all the schools on the campus. The cere-
mony took place December 7, and the group initiated
was addressed by Prof W. H. Hobbs, Head of the
Department of Geology, at the banquet that evening.
Prof. Robert H. Sherlock, of the Civil Engineering
Department, was the only member of the Engineering
College among the faculty initiates.
The senior engineers were Maurice E. Bates, Ernest
F. P.rater, Robert E. Woodhams, Robert E. Blackwell,
Rolxrt W. Merritt, and George A. Spangenberg.
QUARTERDECK
Quarterdeck, marine engineering honorary society,
initiated six active and two honorary members on No-
vember 23. The initiation took place in the Marine
Tank of the West Engineering Building, and was fol-
lowed by a banquet at the Union.
The active members initiated were G. C. Snyder, '34,
T. D. Beery, '34. R. C. Janson. '34. H. J. Sutton, '31,
G. A. Dankers, '35, and W. R. Laurenson, '34.
The honorary members were Dr. John H. Lamble
and Mr. Arthur A. Limpert.
The commodore of the society is William Elmer,
Jr., '34.
VULCANS
The Senior Engineering socitey filled its quota of
members -with the selection of John Seeley, 34E, and
James Doty, 34E. The regular traditional initiation
consisting mostly of anvil pounding by lamp-blackened
initiates is not conducted in the fall.
The Vulcans have inaugurated a series of supper
meetings consisting of round table "Bull Session" with
some interesting personality of the campus. The first
man to conduct the discussion was Joseph Russell of
the Geography Department. He gave a very interest-
ing account of his travels in Japan.

Attention Grads
Who's Where among
Michigan Engineers
Nickel's Arcade
In our frequent wanderings about the campus and
surrounding territory in quest of material for this de-
partment we have stumbled across numerous things—
three curbstones, in an off-hand enumeration, two steps,
broken sidewalks galore (all good engineers know what
Ann Arbor weather does to concrete), a stray dog or
two, and a few equally stray facts. For example, we
have discovered that ever so many nice old ladies are
in the habit of humming softly to themselves that little
ditty entitled: "Annie Doesn't Live Here Any More";
that although practically all people get to driving that
way after being in Ann Arbor a few months the local
water supply apparently has nothing to do with it; and
that only the larger and hardier breeds of the canine
species, such as mastiffs and Saint Bernards, are able
to sleep through campus lectures, the smaller varieties
having to content themselves with nervously chasing
back and forth through the lecture halls. But we have
also discovered, much to our sorrow, that although
Michigan engineers like to hear of the doings and suc-
cesses of their fellows they are reluctant to give others
a chance to hear about their own. All of which is by
way of making our monthly plea to write us and tell
us where you are, what you're doing, and anything else
you may consider our business. And let's hear from
you old timers, too—you will note that this month's
news goes 'way back to a member of the class of 1924.
But anyhow, here it is. »
1924
Mr. Ernest G. Brick has left the .Cadillac Motor
Car Company and is now connected with the Alloy
Steel Division of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube
Company at their Detroit office.
1925
Mr. Howard McClelland is in Vassar, Michigan,
with the Eaton Erbe Foundry Company
1926
Mr. Frederick Green is now in Detroit with Con-
tinental Motors. He is in the Experimental Divi-
sion.
1927
Mr. Albert O. Flindt informed us on a recent visit
that he is with General Electric in the Construction
Department. He is now in Detroit in connection
with an air cooler project.
1928
From Hartford, Connecticut, we hear that Mr.
Nellis M. Harrison is helping the Chance Vought
Company build its airplanes.
If you see any nice shiny new Kresge stores out
this way they will probably be the work of Mr. L. T.
Bishop, who is a Traveling Construction Engineer
for the S. S. Kresge Company.
1929
Dr. Charles W. Selheimer has moved on to the
Gold Dust Corporation's plant at Baltimore, Mary-
land, where he is the new Chemical Supervisor.
Messrs. Wilmer R. Wright and Henry O. Engel-
fried have established an Industrial Engineering
consulting agency at Baltimore, Maryland.

Another member of the colony of Michigan Aero-
nautical engineers at Wayne, Michigan, is Mr. Mat-
thew Haddon. He is with the Stinson Aircraft Cor-
poration.
Mr. Dale I. Watkins is now in the big city. He
is working with the Standard Oil Company of New
York, at New York City.
Mr. Richard W. Berkeley just couldn't get away
from Ann Arbor. He has accepted a position with
the King-Seeley Corporation.

Stresses and
Strains
IF
If you can take the vilest stings invented
And work in them from morn till late at night,
Or with your lot be perfectly contented
When you are asked to fool with dynamite;
If you can still remain quite calm and placid
When plant officials effervesce and fret,
Or being told to test a fuming acid
Can suck it through a 1-cc. pipet;
If you don't get just what the boss expected
Yet have the pluck the true results to state,
And from the truth refuse to be deflected
And never stoop to adding in the date;
If you can read a bunch of sample numbers
When all the labels have been soaked in crude,
And can, when wakened from your slumbers
At 2 A.M., respond in cheerful mood;
If you can drop the fruit of your exertion
Before you've weighed it, on the concrete floor,
And feeling not a symptom of aversion
Can start again as blithely as before;
If you can take a broken desiccator
And from it improvise a Liebig still,
Or gauge the rainfall by the dehydrator
And give three hours a week to first-aid drill;
If you can subjugate all thoughts of pleasure
And still retain a meed of self-esteem;
If you can give your few short hours of leisure
To keeping up with every modern theme;
If you donate your every waking minute
And seek your sole reward in duty done,
Yours is the Lab. and everything that's in it,
And what is more, you're welcome to it, Son.

CHEMISTRY EXPERIMENT
Properties of Ann Arbor H2O
Preliminary. Procure a sample of Ann Arbor H2O
in a 100 cc. beaker. Examine for general physical
properties. (Neglect small particles floating alxmt).
Smell cautiously. Check below which one the odor re-
sembles:
Dead fish x
Sewage disposal plant x
Aged eggs x
Roses
Now place sample in Ehrlenmeyer flask and heat to
60° C. Collect portion of gas driven off and place m
glass cage with mouse.
Results: Mouse dies.
Next, connect a Liebig condenser to flask and collect
sample of distillate.
Results: Turns blue litmus red. Turns red litmus
blue.
Now raise temperature to 90 C., collect sample of
distillate, and place in porcelain dish.
Results: Dish dissolves.
Next raise temperature to 100 C. and boil until res-
idue is obtained. Secure sample of residue. Place
sample in gas flame and examine with spectroscope.
Results: Continuous spectra.
Finally place sample in 500,000 Ih. Tinius Olsen
compression testing machine.
Results: Machine breaks.
Draw Conclusions: There must be something in the
water.
QUICK WORK
In Montana a railway bridge had been destroyed by
fire and it was necessary to replace it. Two days later
came the superintendent of the division. Alighting from
his private car, he encountered the old master bridge
builder.
"Bill," said the superintendent—and the words quiv-
ered with energy—"I want this job rushed. Rvery
hour's delay costs the company money. Have you the
engineer's plans for the new bridge?"
"I don't know," said the bridge builder, "whether the
engineer has his picture drawed yet, but the bridge is
up and the trains is passin' over it."

superiority of any particular method of finishing, but
only to illustrate the differences which do exist, and
how these differences can be measured with the Profil-
ograph.
Curves 1 and 2 of Figure 3 were taken on steel insert
sleeves used in aircraft engine cylinders. It will be noted
that these records are bowed. This was due to the
fact that when the specimens were cut out of the
sleeve, internal strains were relieved so that the speci-
mens warped about .0001" in the '4 inch of length rep-
resented. This warping is not important here, as we
are concerned with the finely-spaced irregularities which
are the roughness. While various observers have disa-
greed which surfaces were smoother when judged visu-
ally, there is no question when the records are com-
pared. The upper curve did not reproduce well; on the
original it shows a large number of irregularities about
5 to 10 millionth^ of an inch in height.
Curves 3 and 4 of Figure 3, and the curves of Figure
4 show the final cylinder finish of three different makes
of automobile. All of these are honed finishes on cast
iron. The car shown in Figure 4 costs about twice as
much as that of Curve 3 of Figure 3.
Curve 5 of Figure 3 shows the finish obtained on a
cylinder with portable tungsten carbide boring equip-
ment used for re-conditioning blocks. Many operators
recommend this as a final operation. With proper hon-
ing after such a boring operation, the surface can be
greatly improved, but of course it is necessary to re-
move enough material to reach the bottom of the pre-
vious profile.
Conclusion
The question immediately arises as to whether or not
a smoother surface is always more desirable and what
magnitudes of roughness are acceptable on various
parts.* Practically no data are available on these
points because in the past no means have been available
for measuring the roughness of the parts under test.
Many manufacturers are convinced that smoother sur-
faces result in less wear, less oil consumption, and
more efficient operation, and now that measuring means
are available it is expected that tests and data will soon
be forthcoming.
The present instrument is a laboratory model, and as
far as we know, is the only one of its kind in exis-
tence. As mentioned above, it is adapted to measure
only comparatively small specimens. This is not a very
serious objection for laboratory work, but of course it
Note: A method of specifying roughness numerically has
been developed on the hasis of these records. See "Specifying
Surface Quality", E. J. Abbott and F. A. Firestone, "Mechan-
ical Engineering", September 1933, page 569.
could hardly be used for routine factory inspection.
We have in mind ideas for the development of lxirtable
indicating instruments which could be used for this
purpose, if the demand warrants.
CULTURE IN EDUCATION

student. A certain Dean Emeritus of an engineering
school spent an hour one day explaining his pet hobby
with all the enthusiasm of a young boy to the current
freshman class of his college. It was the study of ety-
mology which means the tracing the history or deriva-
tions of words and expressions. The Dean told what a
fascinating mental game it had been throughout his
youth and manhood. Many engineers and scientists in
their later years have professed a fondness for painting,
music or some other art which they had developed in
their undergraduate days. These hobbies should Le
chosen by the student so that they would open up new
mental spheres, new physical abilities and commercial
reinforcements during times of stress. Many hobbies
can be developed into profitable sidelines when skill and
proficiency is attained after long and interested prac-
tice. During this late economic upheaval many men
have been placed on their own without a salaried posi-
tion in their chosen profession but are peacefully and
profitably biding their time by commercializing their
pet hobby as a source of income. We might say that
they were following the advice of C. M. Manley who
was a co-worker of Professor Langley's while pioneer-
ing in Aerodynamics, "So conduct yourself that at any
time you can tell the whole world to go to h ."
It has been said that one of the important things we
learn in our days in the University is how to live with
people. We learn this slowly or comparatively fast ac-
cording to our knowledge of life and the people in it.
If we come from rather small families and small circles
of acquaintances we are appalled at such a large group
of people gathered together in such an institution. While
if we have worked in the commercial world or taken
part in many social activities previous to beginning our
college career we are not so bewildered upon entering
into the life and activities of the campus. This drives
home the fact that while we are here on a large campus
we must take part in social functions to a more or
less degree, or simply we must go out and meet other
people and learn how to become a part of adult society.
The friendships and the ties we develop during college
days are very important not only in respect to the people
themselves but they are indications of our ability to
gain the confidence and trust of other people in our-
selves which are so necessary to our relationships in
the future while practicing in the profession.
The curriculum that we undergo is designed to pro-

worlds as well as the scientific world. In order to be-
come leaders we must rub elbows with people in all
walks of life. We must learn the types of men and
women in the other professions and appreciate their
problems and ideals. \Ye should also understand the
kinds of people that we are to direct and manage in the
practice of our chosen life's work. \\e must realize out
duties to them and the responsibilities which our lead-
ership necessarily places on our shoulders concerning
their welfare. We should not be adverse to becoming
friends with foreign students because of the differences
in race, creed or personal habits. To be able to look
at the particular problems of life from the other fel-
low's point of view as well as your own is an inesti-
mable quality of character to develop. This quality will
make possible very rapid progress when trying to put
across unheard of innovations and drastic changes in
industry, in later years, providing one is able to ex-
press himself adequately and interestingly.
The ability to write clearly, concisely and at all
times hold the interest of the reader is one of the most
valuable tools in any profession. In engineering this
ability is an absolute necessity if the student is to rise
to a respected position in his profession. He must also
be able to face large groups and express his ideas, views
and criticisms with ease and collectiveness without fos-
tering any ill will or encouraging any belligerence. The
young engineer during his first years out of school will
be called upon to render detailed reports concerning his
work to his superiors either by written or spoken lan-
guage and then he will appreciate the experience he
gained in his undergraduate days in public speaking
and composition.
If one is able to analyze in advance the type of audi-
ence or the type of reader to whom he is speaking or
writing, his task is much simpler. A knowledge of the
general principles of modern psychology and the be-
havior characteristics of people are of great value to the
engineer as well as the doctor and lawyer. A little time
and organized reading can give this general idea which
makes possible the analysis of the people with whom
you live and work. There are many volumes on psy-
chology written for the layman which contain all the
fundamentals but lack that certain academic atmosphere
of works written specifically for the doctor and psycho-
analyst.
Before the last economic depression there was a very
strong movement in engineering education for special-
ization. Now the movement seems to be in the direc-
tion of fundamentalism. It seems that industry created
a demand for the highly trained specialist when every-
body was doing all in his power to increase production,
but now it seems that the engineering skill required
must be versatile and available for any sort of problem.
But there is no reason why this movement which advo-
cates a rigorous training in the fundamental principles

of engineering education in this country.
Mr. Veal in his article mentioned earlier in this manu-
script said "Ample evidence is available that educators,
engineering graduates and practicing engineers endorse
the view that your primary object during your college
course should be to acquire a foundation of knowledge
of fundamental principles and methods. In general, ac-
tual specialization should be postponed to the years after
graduation and be undertaken either in the graduate
school or in connection with introductory experience."
A class of sophomore engineers taking a course in
college physics were complaining to the professor that
they could not understand the principle of self induc-
tance in the study of electromagnetism. They solemnly
denied having neglected to have studied the assignment.
And after the professor had made several noble at-
tempts with the help of drawings to lead the class out
of the dark regarding this principle, he dismissed the
class and with a hint of sarcasm in his voice he said.
"An evidence of education is the power and habit of
reflection." This illustrates the idea of scientific think-
ing and its importance in any line of work. By reflecting
upon the first principles concerned in a problem the
newer theories seem less awesome and impossible and
soon after working with the new principles they be-
come as the old, obvious and all together trustworthy.
To be good engineers we must always be looking for-
ward and we must be always willing to consider and
investigate new ideas and theories no matter how im-
possible and foolish they seem at first glance. Mr.
Zeder, the vice-president in charge of engineering re-
search for Chrysler Motors, wrote recently in an engi-
neering publication "It takes courage, honesty and
willingness to scrap the obsolete. Far reaching effects
are sometimes produced both mechanically and socially
by seemingly slight variations. We should be willing
and glad to make changes."
To be able to solve the ordinary engineering problem
encountered in the industrial world the engineer must
have a background in the cultural, commercial and
financial fields as well as engineering. Dean Sadler of
our own College of Engineering, at the University ot
Michigan, in a paper he delivered at the spring meeting
of the Ohio section of the Society for the Promotion
of Engineering Education, stated that the efficiency r.f
the solution of an engineering problem depended on
several factors, fle compared it to the expression for
the overall efficiency of a machine—E—-e, x e, x c:i x c\.
Where (ej represented purely the engineering and
scientific or design efficiency; (e2) the financial or eco-
nomic efficiency; (e:;) the operative efficiency and (e4)
the factor of personnel relations. This clearly shows
that the student engineer should study certain courses
offered in the College of Literature, Arts and Sciences.
After the engineer receives his degree he should not
consider his diploma as a certificate of universal learn-
ing nor expect it to be a guaranty of a position in indus-
try. Not for one instant should he bluff himself with
self assumed importance due to his new title. Bachelor
of Science in Engineering. Polonius in his wisdom once
said "This above all, to thine ownself be true". A
thorough understanding of one's own failings and de-
ficiencies is one proof of an educated man. The ability
to continue to learn and the power of reflection are
other essential qualities of an educated man which
should have been acquired during his college career to
enable him to think correctly and constructively con-
cerning the solution of the problems of life.
TOWER CLOCK
(Continued from pngc Id]
tion of the clock, mentioning, among other things, "the
clock is warranted for a period of five years."
The chimes were rung at 8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M..
to signify the beginning and end of the study day. They
soon came to be called the "Library Chimes". When
or why the time of ringing was changed, no one seems
to know. Even after the clock was installed, there was
one bell rung by hand. Old "Doc" Xagele. janitor in
the Medical School, continued to call his charges to
class with his hand bell, in competition with the clock,
until the time of his death in 1905.
In July, 1917, when the reading rooms and towers of
the old Library were demolished to make way for the
present building, the clock and bells were taken down
and installed in the tower of what was then the engi-
neering shops. Here the effect of the bells is not as
good because they are lower down and surrounded by
buildings. The accompanying pictures show the fall
of the old tower after its foundations had been under-
mined, and the clock as it stands today.
Mr. Geo. Lutz, Sr.. still in the employ of the Univer-
sity, for a long time had charge of the winding of the
clock and the ringing of the bell for chapel at 8:50 every
morning. W. W. Campbell. '86E. who came from the
Observatory once a week to regulate the clock, is now
President Emeritus of the University of California,
and has received two honorary degrees from Michigan:
that of Master of Science in 1899, and Doctor of Sci-
ence in 1905. Through Mr. Lutz, and an article wr't-
ten for the Michigan Alumnus in May, 1919, by Byron
A. Finney, '71, Reference Librarian Emeritus, the ma-
terial for this article was secured.
.Surprising to most students is the fact of the clock's
being wound by hand instead of being electrically
driven. The electric clocks all over the campus are in
no way connected to the tower clock, but are governed
by a master clock in the basement of the East Physics
Building.

Construction
By Robert^E. Hayes, '33E
IN reviewing the early books on aircraft construction
in the light of present day knowledge one sees how
rapidly and radically the aircraft industry has de-
veloped its methods of analysis and constructional
technique. Indeed, so great has
been the change that there is no
reason to believe that we may
not yet expect further outmoding
of methods. At the same time,
however, there are certain atti-
tudes and principles growing in
the minds of modern designers,
which because of their basic logic
seem as if they must prevail over
a long period of time.
In a book published in 1911
( Kennedy—Principles of Aero-
plane Construction) we find the
statement, "The defects of the
present day machines can be
summed up in a few words. All through they are defi-
cient in what engineers term 'the margin of safety'. In
all mechanical structures a high margin of safety is nec-
essary.'' The attitude thruout the entire engineering
profession, however, is changing. We no longer pride
ourselves in the great magnitude of "the margin of
safety" since this term implies nothing more than the
degree to which we are not sure just what forces may
be encountered. The lower the margin of safety the
greater is the indication that that particular industry
knows just what may be expected of its products. In
the aircraft industry the margin of safety is really
assumed to be one but is expressed in terms of load
factor.
Since he is working to closer and closer limits it is
necessary that the modern designer keep in touch not
only with the latest developments in strength of mate-
rials but also in theoretical and experimental aerody-
namics. For, first of all, in order to use these low safety
factors one must know exactly what loads will come
ulion the structure and when he is ready to design a
structure which does the maximum amount of work
without failure for the least amount of weight.
Another of these basic ideas is the one just presented
of making all of the material in the structure work to
the limit. Some interesting results are achieved by tak-
ing beams tmder certain loading conditions and deter-
mining the dimensions so that the maximum amount of
EDITOR'S NOTE
This is the essay with which Bob
won the First Award in the 1933
W. E. Boeing Scholarship Contest.
He is now at the Boeing School of
Aeronautics, Oakland Airport, Cali-
fornia, completing his Master Pilot's
course, after which he plans to spe-
cialize in air transportation.

elastic energy is stored in all of the extreme fibres at
once. These constant strength beams turn out to be
beams of reasonable dimensions. The tapered wing
spar is an example of this. Since all the fibres will take
a certain amount of stress it is
advantageous that they all work
an equivalent amount, for an
equal distribution of stress means
a smaller total of material to
carry. This is something of the
old proposition of the "One Hoss
Shay": but. whereas that just
made an amusing 1x&gt;em, an air-
plane with the same care of de-
sign and construction would make
a 100 percent efficient structure.
Since a covering for the wing
and fuselage is aerodynamically
necessary there is no reason why
it should not carry some of the stress. In small air-
planes the weight of the drag bracing plus the weight
of the fabric covering may be less than a metal cover-
ing which takes the drag; load itself, but as the size of
airplanes increases it becomes economical from a weight
standpoint to use a metal covering. The smooth sheets
rather than the corrugated ones are coming into greater
and greater favor from the standlxiint of aerodynamics
and appearance.
At the same time we are considering means of stress-
ing all of the fibres to a maximum we should not forget
those places, which if designed according to elemen-
tary theory, are working beyond their elastic limits
without our knowledge but which eventually may lead
to complete failure. We know from experience that
adjacent to holes there are areas of high stress concen-
tration but in the past we have simply increased the
size of such parts until they could carry the load. In
doing this we quite often are too conservative. Photo-
elasticity offers an excellent opportunity as a method
for .the design of fittings and other sections which suf-
fer stress concentrations and lie in the field of two-
dimensional analysis. This method illustrates graphically
the advantages of large fillets; moreover, it also indi-
cates why proper welding would be better than riveting
because of the stress concentrations produced when
holes are either punched or drilled in the materials.
In the future we shall undoubtedly use plastic flow

instead of shunning it. The University of Michigan,
along with others no doubt, has begun to teach courses
in plasticity. Residual stresses are already being used
to advantage in some structures. (iun barrels made by
shrink fitting one tube on the other are examples. There
are many fittings on airplanes where the stresses arl-
always in the same direction and it might be possible
to overstress the fitting in the proper direction before
use and then take advantage of the residual stresses.
From the standpoint of maintenance and durability
more attention will be paid to fatigue and corrosion
failures. There are many parts of the airplane structure
which may fail from fatigue because of vibrations in-
duced by the airflow or the propeller. For example, the
tail group is often subjected to serious vibrations. If
the wings do not come into the fuselage perpendicularlv
to the surface, it is essential that the proper fillets be
used in fairing the wing in or else the effective aspect
ratio will be reduced and vortices flowing down the
side of the fuselage will cause dangerous tail buffeting.
Resonance conditions must of course be avoided but
just the ordinary vibrations of the tail group may
eventually lead to failure. Taylor (W. Harold Taylor
—"Some Studies on the Flutter of Airfoils and Pro-
pellers") has shown that full cantilever wings have a
period of self-induced torsional vibration. Tt follows
then that the root fittings should be designed for a
fatigue limit of approximately 100x10" reversals of
stress when aluminum fittings are used and 300x10"
reversals when steel fittings are used. Corrosion in
metal and rot in wood arc very dangerous. The wide-
spread use of airplanes like that of automobiles will
make this more and more important. Sea water, ice
and snow, and scorching sunlight, all offer their own
individual difficulties. This will lead to greater use of
nickle and chromium alloys and new light protective
coatings to be applied either with the spray gun or
electrolytically.
Practically all of the previously mentioned trends of
design presuppose the use of metal construction. This.
we believe, was justified. The advantages of wood lie
entirely in the small plane field. Rxcept in the case of
large scale production the cost of metal construction
in small planes is inclined to be greater than that of
wood construction, but an airplane the size of the Do-X
would have been impossible if constructed of wood.
The question, however, is not a new one. In a book-
published in 1912 (Jackson, Russell and Chanute—
"Flying Machines") we find a paragraph entitled Why
U'ood is Favored, which says, "The frequently asked
question is, 'why is not aluminum or some similar metal
substituted for wood?' Wood, particularly spruce, is
preferred because, weight considered, it is much
stronger than aluminum and this is the lightest of all
metals." Little did the authors of that book foresee the
use of aluminum alloys, magnesium, or beryllium.
Langley (in "Metal Aircraft Construction) in 1932
says, "The construction of aircraft in metal has passed
the stage when it needs advocacy. The arguments and
discussions which stirred technical meetings five or
ten years ago have lost their point. Metal construction
has become an accomplished fact, and there is barely
a machine designed today for any other material, ex-
cept in the light aeroplane class." The use of metal in
aircraft was given great impetus during the World
War when it became difficult to obtain suitable wood.
But now, even with this restriction removed, we find
a continued use of metal due to its greater reliability
because of a more homogeneous nature, its greater
resistance to climate and weather, the reduction of fire
risks, its ability to be worked into a greater number of
shapes and sizes, and the greater efficiency and dura-
bility of metal joints.
We think of yesterday's metals with their puny
strengths compared with our present day alloys and
almost stand in awe of the development. But there is
no reason to believe that we have come to the end of
possibilities. Tensile tests up to a million pounds per
square inch have been achieved with glass threads
having highly polished surfaces. We know that the
molecular strengths of these substances are more than
twice this high figure. These we cannot hope to exceed
but we may be able to approximate these strengths
very closely. The high polished surface as a means of
increasing the strength of materials is taking on more
importance all the time. Dr. Rosenhain says: "I would
rather have the poorest of our spring steels with a
ground and polished surface than a roughly finished
spring plate of the l&gt;est alloy that money can buy."
Heat treating has made our present use of metals many
times more effective than in the past. In the near fu-
ture we may look for the heat treating of entire units
rather than just simple parts. The importance of pick-
ing the particular material for each part can not be
over emphasized. In the matter of fittings, for example,
some must be especially hard, others must be ductile.
These two cases call for entirely different types of
metal, at least at present. Attention to details such as
this matter of selecting the best possible material for
the job is what turns out the most efficient airplanes.

into more common use. Frameworks in space are re-
ceiving more attention. Of course, there is little object
in extremely accurate truss analysis if there is evidence
that the loading is perhaps not just as the designer
assumed it to be. These two advances, aerodynamics
and rigorous analysis, will come together.
The present important trend toward monocoque
construction has thrown out a large number of new
problems for immediate solution. The buckling of very
thin plates is one. Whether it is better to use tension
fields in flat sheets or shear and compression in curved
sheets, is another. Elastic failures are difficult to ac-
count for with great accuracy when the effect of stiff -
eners and bulkheads is still a matter of conjecture.
The possible types of construction of an all-metal
wing are varied and numerous. Many of the problems
of fuselage are common to the wing so that an im-
provement in one is apt to be paralleled by an improve-
ment in the other.
In conclusion, we must remember that perhaps the
most important trend and necessity for good construc-
tion is an exact knowledge of aerodynamics, without
which extreme accuracy of structural analysis is use-
less. The trend toward larger transport aircraft, which
necessitates metal construction, brings with it a wide-
spread influence to use metal for all sizes of airplanes.
The use of metal puts a premium on metallurgical
developments, particularly in aluminum and magnesium
alloys. Now, as competition becomes more keen, it
becomes necessary to go farther into the details of
construction such as the design of fittings and the all-
important feature of making more of the material
work to earn its justification as a part of the aircraft
structure. The problem of aircraft construction has
passed the stage when anything that would fly was an
achievement. We must continually consider more
seriously even some of the lesser items mentioned here
so that the resulting structure will achieve its end,
which is not just a beautiful and efficient structure,
but a reliable, safe, and comfortable means of trans-
portation as well as a more rapid means than any other.
Smashing the Atom
A Research Project Being Carried on in the Physics Department Under
the Supervision of Professor James Cork
CONTINUALLY probing the mystery of the
elements, scientists have resorted to many means
of breaking down the more complex atoms into
hydrogen and helium nuclei and studying the radia-
tions and emanations occuring when these transforma-
tions take place. Probably the most interesting of these
methods is that of bombarding metals with positive
ions which are given enormous velocities by the use
.jf high potentials. At the present time there are three
such set-ups in the country. The gigantic one at The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one at Wash-
ington, D.C. and one in our own East Physics Building.
Under the supervision of Professor James Cork, this
super experiment is being set up and operated. The
apparatus is housed in a very large room which extends
in height through both the basement and sub-basement
of the Physics Building. Perhaps the most striking
object to one viewing the apparatus is the large alum-
inum sphere which is used to collect the electric charge.
This sphere is six feet in diameter and was constructed
in the shops of the University. It is supported by a
"Textolite" pillar, eight feet high and three feet in
diameter which is constructed of impregnated, lam-
inated, pressed paper. The finished cylinder is coated
with ceresin which is impervious to water and has a
very high surface resistance. Since the sphere attains
very high voltages, the pillar must be made of excellent
insulating material. The base of the pillar rests on a
large compartment which houses the equipment for
spraying the electric charge on moving belts which
carry the charge to the sphere at the top of the pillar.
In order to produce very high voltages which serve
to accelerate the ions, it is necessary to get as much
charge on the sphere as possible, since its voltage is
proportional to its charge. The moving belts which
carry the charge from the base of the pillar to the
sphere move inside the pillar. They are made of paper
sixteen inches wide and each is capable of supporting
one and one half tons in tension. The charge is sprayed
on these belts at 20.000 volts with a screen arrange-
ment. A device in the sphere takes the charge off the
belts, transferring it to the sphere. Theoretically it
should be possible to reach a voltage of 3,000,000,
Professor Cork said, but so far the maximum obtained
has perhaps been about 1,500,000 volts.

long and four inches in diameter. In this the positive
ions are given their acceleration. The tube is kept
evacuated by means of a mercury pump. Xine corona
shields encircle the tube in order to keep the field
constant. Inside the sphere is equipment for heating a
specially prepared filament which gives off positive
lithium ions. This filament is mounted at the sphere
end of the evacuated tube. The ions are accelerated
by the very high voltage of the sphere and strike the
target at the other end of the tube with an enormous
velocity. When an ion smashes into the target it has
been found that nuclear transformations may occur,
giving rise to entirely different atoms than those of
the elements used. At the present time Professor Cork
is bombarding lithium with lithium. As this element
appears in nature, it is a mixture of two isotopes of
atomic weight six and seven respectively, hence three
possible results of the bombardment present themselves.
The end products to be expected are alpha particles
(helium nuclei) and perhaps the newly discovered
particles, neutrons and deutrons.
, The products formed in the nuclear collisions are at
present detected by observing their range with a "Gei-
ger Counter." This is an arrangement of ionization
chamber and vacuum tube amplifier, such that a single
alpha particle entering the chamber will actuate a
counter in the output circuit of the amplifier. Thus a
record of the total number of particles arriving in any
interval of time is obtained. The instrument is so sensi-
tive that cosmic radiation moves the pointer every so
often and a radio active substance held close to the ion-
izing chamber makes the pointer move at a lively clip.
At the present time Professor Cork and his assist-
ant are setting up a "Wilson Cloud Chamber" method
of observing the ionized particles and expect to put
it to use in a short time. This consists of a chamber
containing air and saturated water vapor. In passing
through air, the alpha particle creates a multitude of
new ions. Now if the chamber is suddenly expanded,
vapor condenses on the ions formed, leaving a trail
which can be photographed thru a transparent window
in the chamber. Two photographs are taken simultane-
ously from different angles, in order to give a three
dimensional picture of the path of the ion.
Measuring the voltage of the sphere presented a
variety of difficulties but they have been overcome In-
using a substance known as xylene for a resistance.
Xylene is a liquid having a very high resistance and is
contained in a long, thin, glass tube which runs from
the sphere to the base of the pillar. A galvanometer
measures the current through the resistance and hence
the fall of potential.
Great strides have been made by scientists in laying
bare the riddle of the atom. Who knows but what the
near future will see further discoveries made which
will eventually lead to harnessing the atomic energy.
SLIDE RULE DANCE
The most informal formal of the year, the Engineer's
Slide Rule Dance is once again in a state of prepara-
tion. The twenty-third of March is the red letter day
this year. On that date the Engineer can hie himself to
the Union, see familiar faces all about him and have
a whooping good time. Those who have attended these
dances in the past will testify to that.
Plans are going ahead with plenty of zip and the
dance promises to outdo even last years bell ringer.
Stan Killian, of Oak Park, 11l. has been chosen as
chairman. He has picked the following committee to
supervise and arrange the affair. The job of assistant
chairman is filled by William Mohrhoff. Selection of
an orchestra is under the guidance of Steinar Vaksdal.
Kenneth Roe is in charge of Programs and Invitations
and Publicity will be handled by Jack Salmon. Deco-
rations will Ix; supervised by Don Anderson. Joy
Bnrnett will head the Floor Committee. Ticket sales
will be in charge of Stuart Smart with Arthur Mosier
as his first assistant.
An orchestra has not yet been selected but an
announcement will be forthcoming in the near future.
Tickets will be moderately priced, and here's a final
word. Last year the tickets lasted only three days after
they were put on sale. Class dances this year have all
been sellouts, so get your ticket early and avoid being
disappointed, for here's one party. Engineer, that you
can't afford to miss.
A. I. Ch.E.
"The laminated safety glass of today has largely met
with its present success because of its relatively low
cost and the development of a permanent, transparent
lamination," said Dr. George B. Watkins, Director of
Research at Ivibby-Owens-Ford. at the A.I.Ch.E. meet-
ing on January 10. "The manufacture of a cellulose
bonding material that was then affected by the ultra-
violet and infra-red rays of the sun was responsible for
the failure of safety glass to meet with public approval
during the early days of motoring. Besides, the cost of
producing this glass tended to make it prohibitive.''
Dr. Watkins went on to say.
Dr. Watkins' talk was completely illustrated with
slides showing the manufacture of the glass. At the
end of his talk, Dr. Watkins gave his audience a treat
by breaking different kinds of glass before them. He
shattered plate glass with a single blow, but he had to
rap several times before a sheet of safety glass finally
cracked. Then he powdered the safety or "hardened"
glass produced abroad with a few blows.
Dr. Watkins was an instructor in chemical research
at the University here from 1924 to 1927. He is a
member of Alpha Chi Sigma, a national chemists fra-

Structural Metal
By Dr. John A. Gann, Metallurgist, Dow Chemical Company
T1IK light metals have definitely established them-
selves in our industrial life. This is shown not
only by the increasingly large tonnage annually
consumed but also by the rapid expansion of the fields
in which they are being successfully used. The term
''light metals'' is generally accepted to mean those
metals with a specific gravity under 3.8. These light
metals are classed together lxith in the periodic table
of elements and in the electromotive series. They are
found as stable oxides and salts, which are reduced to
the metallic state by the expenditure of considerable
energy. The heavy metals, on the other hand, occur
either in the native state or in the form of readily re-
ducible ores. Many of the light metals are successfully
used as minor alloying elements, but only three—
aluminum, magnesium and beryllium—are sufficiently
stable to be considered as structural materials.
While many of the commercial heavy metals have
been known and used for thousands of years, the age
of light metals covers but a single century and their
large-scale use, a much shorter time. The first pro-
duction of aluminum, magnesium and beryllium oc-
curred at approximately the same time, 1825-1830.
Aluminum and magnesium are now used commercially,
but a beryllium industry scarcely exists, since pro-
duction does not exceed a few pounds daily, valued at
from $100 to $200 per pound.
Commercial production of magnesium began in the
United States in 1915 and in the last few years the
industry has grown by leaps and bounds. The relative
growth of the magnesium industry has been much
greater than that of the aluminum industry, 1300 Ib.
of aluminum being made for each pound of magnesium
in 1922, as compared to only 250 Ib. of aluminum for
each pound of magnesium in 1929. In 1929 the average
price of magnesium was 57 cents a pound, while today
it is quoted at around 28 cents per pound, indicating the
effect of improved methods of production due to in-
creased demand.
Magnesium metal is produced electrolytically from a
fused magnesium chloride—sodium chloride cell bath.
The metal formed is lighter than the bath and, there-
fore, rises and floats on its surface but does not burn
because of the protecting action of a thin film of
molten salt. The sludge that forms in the normal opera-
tion of the cell is heavy and immediately sinks. The
automatic separation of the metal and the sludge, the
high purity of the cell feed, and the washing and
purifying action of the cell bath combine to yield a
metal of such purity that subsequent refining is un-
necessary. The average analysis runs 99.90 per cent.
The succesful operation of the electrolytic cell gave
the clue to the present foundry melting practice. A
flux similar in composition to the cell bath performs
a multitude of duties. It completely surrounds the
metal in the foundry pot, protecting it from surface
oxidation. It purifies the metal from non-metallic con-
taminations by a washing action. This process is so
complete that returned scrap can be treated and the
resulting melt cannot be distinguished from virgin
metal.
Special ladles are used to transfer the metal to the
molds. These ladles are equipped with a parting sweep
that cuts the protective flux-film in the pot, a retaining
shield to hold back the surface-oxide that forms on the

that only clean metal enters the mold.
In the casting of magnesium, special attention must
be given to gates and risers. A perforated skim-gate
at the base of each sprue helps to give the casting a
uniform feed of metal, free from turbulence and me-
chanically occluded gas that may have been entrapped
in the sprue. The use of long wedge gates supplements
the action of the skim-gate. The extreme lightness of
the metal calls for abundant risers to counteract shrink-
age and internal porosity. Test specimens couple ease
of molding with sound castings.
Most of the common metals alloy readily with mag-
nesium. Notable exceptions are: manganese above 2
per cent, iron, chromium, vanadium and related metals.
The commercial magnesium-base alloys now in use
fall into three general classes: (a) magnesium-alumin-
um-manganese alloys, (b) magnesium-manganese al-
loys and (c) complex magnesium-copper alloys. The
majority of magnesium castings and fabricated parts
are now made from the first type because of their su-
perior mechanical properties. The copper-bearing alloy
has superior thermal properties, and the magnesium-
manganese alloys are attracting attention because of
their excellent corrosion resistance.
The possibility of heat treatment has been recognized,
and because of the improved properties resulting, a
large percentage of magnesium-alloy castings are now
being used in the heat treated condition. Heat treat-
ment of castings increases the tensile strength from
28,000 Ib./sq.in. to 36,000 Ib./sq.in. and the elonga-
tion in 2" from 7 per cent to 12 per cent. Improved
methods of fabrication and processing of these alloys
has increased their availability in a wide range of
structural shapes, as well as sheet, plate, etc. Ease of
machining is another big asset in all the magnesium
alloys. Also they can be joined together either by acety-
lene fusion welding or by pressure methods, such as
electric spot or seam welding.
Magnesium alloys are rapidly rising into industrial
prominence because they offer a combination of ex-
treme lightness coupled with good physical and me-
chanical properties unsurpassed by any other engineer-
ing material. Magnesium is only two-thirds the weight
of aluminum and less than one-quarter as heavy as
steel. Wrought magnesium alloys have an ultimate ten-
sile strength of 40,000 Ib./sq.in. and on an equal weight
basis the tensile properties are equal to those of high
grade steel and duralumin.
The commercial utilization of a new product usually
begins by taking advantage of its most outstanding
characteristics. In the case of magnesium, this means
extreme lightness coupled with strength and tough-
ness. Such a combination of properties at once sug-
gests its application to portable hand-operated equip-
ment, in high-speed reciprocating parts of machinery'
and in transportation industries. Its light weight can
be capitalized in solving problems combating inertia
and centrifugal forces. The greatest interest in the
possibilities of these alloys is being shown in the auto-
motive and aircraft industries, to which we look for
further significant development.
Triangular Discussion
on the St. Lawrence Waterway
The participation of three faculty members in a tri-
angular discussion on January 24. on the much-
disputed St. Lawrence Seaway probably furnished the
outstanding event last month of engineering interest.
The discussion was under the auspices of Sigma Rho
Tau, engineers stump speakers society. Professors
Menefee, Peterson, and Worlev comprised the group
which wrangled over the question which has since come
before Congress. Of the three faculty representatives,
one, Prof. Menefee, maintained a definite stand in
favor of the project. The other two did not take any
stand on the subject, but rather limited their discussions
to pointing out the facts which must be taken into
consideration. In any event, the vote of those present
after the discussions were over, was approximately
3:2 in favor of the United States participating in the
construction of the waterwav.
After a short business meeting of the society con-
ducted by Robert E. Woodhams, 34E-36L. the debate
was opened by Prof. Ferdinand N. Menefee, of the
engineering mechanics department. Prof. Menefee
argued that the Great Lakes Basin is one of the world's
richest regions in natural resources, and should not be
left landlocked. He stated that one third of the fresh
water on this globe is in the Great Lakes. The Basin
is located next to mineral and coal fields, and the water-
way furnishes a natural avenue for the transportation
of these raw materials. He continued with some details
of the waterway, the locks, power developments, and
financial figures. It is estimated that the United States
government will spend $150,000,000 on the project
if it goes thru Congress. Of the power developments
in the international section, it is understood, so he said.
that the United States will share the benefits on a

probable savings and ended up by stressing the desir-
ability of the waterway, because of the tremendous
resources awaiting development. "Of any one spot on
this earth, we possess the greatest natural resources
the world has ever known," he said.
Prof. Shorey Peterson, of the economics department,
next took the floor. He stated that before any economic
issue could be decided, the facts pertinent to the case
must be established and a logical framework upon
which to fit the facts must be made. He warned the
audience against becoming too easily convinced either
one way, or the other. The arguments for each side
must be considered carefully to see that all the facts are
presented completely. For an example, he cited the
argument of the advocates of the project on the savings
possible in wheat transportation to Liverpool. He stated
tliat claims of savings in wheat transportation amount-
ing from 10 to 12 cents per bushel had been made by
the interests in favor of the waterway. As a matter
of fact, he continued, wheat has been transported to
Liverpool for 10 and 12 cents. This would mean, that
with the waterway savings, wheat could l&gt;e shipped to
Liverpool for nothing. The trouble is, he said, that the
savings have been calculated on the costs of shipping
wheat during the winter. At that time of the year the
waterway would not be in operation anyway. In esti-
mating the cost of the project, the extra developments
brought about by the construction of the system, may
properly be charged to the original cost of the water-
way. I'oat rates in the future, and possible changes
in railroad rates should be reckoned with, he said. Also,
the project would necessitate taxation on the whole
country, whereas only a part of it would reap the bene-
fits. There should be a convincing showing of savings
l&gt;efore the government undertakes the project, he ended.
Prof. John S. Worley, of the transportation engine-
ering department, began frankly by saying that he
didn't know whether he favored the seaway, or not.
He claimed that he had never read any published mate-
rial on the subject which contained sufficient reasons
to warrant the construction of the waterway. He warned
the budding engineers present against "being led astray
by subjects of this kind which are told in pretty words."
He agreed with Prof. Menefee that the Great Lakes
I'asin was a great country, but "does it warrant the
seaway?", he added. Undoubtedly Michigan would en-
joy additional advantages if the project were completed,
he asserted, but what of the rest of the country? He
avowed that if he were a senator, he would vote against
it until better reasons were forthcoming. The subject
is by no means new, a paper having appeared on the
seaway in 1824. Also, he continued, the Canadians
have been going ahead on this waterway, expecting the
United States to do its part. Thus we have moral obli-
gations to consider too, he concluded.

Prof. John S. Worley
After Prof. Worley's presentation, there followed a
lively open discussion, involving various aspects of the
question. Among them, the drainage canal of Chicago
furnished a good deal of controversy. Prof. Menefee
insisted that this practice of diverting the waters of
Lake Michigan into the Mississippi was unlawful. He
claimed that for every cubic foot the city of Chicago
took out of Lake Michigan, Canada was deprived of
2\'i H.P.
The attendance was beyond all expectations.

High heat pot for hardening high grade tools
FIRELESS ANNEALING
The advantages of heat treatment by submersion has
been proven throughout the long years of experience
with such methods. Molten lead or salt and soda baths
have been used for a great many years and recently
cyanide baths have come into use. However it was not
until high temperatures — 1600° V. or over — were
needed that difficulties were encountered. This prob-
lem was in connection with oxidizing and fuming of
the salts. The most recent problem, however, arises in
connection with the containers themselves.
At very high temperatures and for long periods it
is difficult to attain uniform heats due to the hot spots
which are set up in the pot which is in contact with the
hot salts on one side and hot furnace gasses on the
other. Any hot spot is quickly eaten through. The solu-
tion has finally been reached in the production of heat
resistant metal and a method of internal heating. The
plan of heating is by passing an electrical current
through the pot through the medium of an internally
inserted electrode. In smaller pots the container itself
forms one part of the circuit. The voltage of heating
current varies with the size of the pot but usually is
between 10 and 40 volts. In order to insure high effi-
ciency the pots are amply insulated and their use is
now to such a degree of perfection that the containers
are now cooler than the contents.
Many applications have been found for multiple units
of internally heated pots in the field of high speed steel
where pitting, scaling, and dimensional changes have
been troublesome. In addition to the higher quality
product, interesting recuperative and regenerative proc-
esses have been developed. When a series of pots are
used for preheating with a range of increasing tempera-
tures, the same pots may be used for cooling in the re-
verse direction thus economizing on much heat.
EXTRACTING HEAT OF HYDRATION
The Boulder Dam projects have been the scene of
many an innovation in engineering, but the scheme of
artificially dissipating the chemical heat generated by
the setting of 3,400,000 cubic yards of concrete over-
shadows them all. The dam design problems, resulting
from temperature stresses set up by the heating and
Subsequent cooling, reach unprecedented proportions in
this new project. An artificial means of extracting the
heat of hydration from the concrete was necessary. As
a result a large size refrigeration has been set up and
delivers cooling water through pipes embedded in the
structure.
The present system provides a two-stage cooling
operation, (1) Water cooled by natural evaporation:
and (2) refrigerated water at about 40 ;both of these
use the same cooling pipe system. An eight foot cen-
tral slot is left through the dam during construction to
provide for the cooling system header pipes. The four
main pipes, of 14-inch diameters, extend upward on the
downstream face of the dam and are carried upward
as the dam progresses. From these main headers, 6
inch headers are extended into the slot to the upstream
face, hung on J-hangers attached to the concrete. Both
of these pipes are insulated with two inches of cork.
In turn these headers are connected with rubber hose
to the maze of one inch pipes embedded in the con-
crete and running from the central slot to the abut-
ments. All of the maze of pipes, totaling 300 miles,
are designed to withstand a pressure of 100 Ibs. per
square inch. The spacing of these pipes depends on the
particular section of the dam, and the volume of con-
crete surrounding.
In the closed refrigerating system, three 750 g.p.ni.
electrically operated centrifugal pumps are used with
ease. However in the open-air-cooled system the pump-

loss of head due to increased height necessitates the
installation of a system of booster pumps and the
changing of the water supply to various levels. The
plant which has a capacity of 825 tons of refrigeration
(the unit 'ton' is the heat needed to melt one ton of ice
per day) is driven completely with machinery remod-
elled from that used earlier in the construction.
An idea of the immensity of the project can be seen
from its first run. Water at 44• was pumped at 1,000
gals, per minute into headers representing 50 cu. ft. of
concrete and was returned at a temperature of 74
degrees.
INTERSECTION TRAFFIC
Startling conclusions were recently disclosed in re-
gard to traffic regulation as a result of a traffic study
made by the Bureau of Public Roads. These studies
were made to determine the cause of the delay caused
to moderately heavy flow of traffic by different control
methods. The tests were made under normal street
traffic, about 2,000 vehicles per hour, crossing one of
the major street intersections in Washington.
It was found that delays were greater under all svs-
tems of control than when there was no control; and
of the various control systems, officer control caused
the least delay, followed in this respect by the shortest
fixed-time control and traffic-actuafed control. The
traffic engineers discovered that under the fixed-time
control, a very marked increase in delay followed the
lengthening of the time between traffic direction
changes. The flexible control methods (officer and
traffic-actuated) were as effective as the most efficient
fixed-time control. During a 10 hour day, the two hours
of peak traffic that occurred caused as much delay as
the remaining eight hours.
Rush hour traffic was not considered since constant
volume was desired and the flow under rush hours
varied too rapidly. (i
"ARC ARRESTER"
Without introducing mechanical devices to suppress
the arc it is possible to speed a.c. arc extinctions with
a simple, rugged, single-break type of contactor by
inclusion of an "arc arrester". This recent development
by Westinghouse for mounting on the base of a con-
tactor or linestarter involves a small unit consisting
of a small capacitor and resistor connected across the
poles on the load side of the contacting device.
Effectiveness of the development is said to be start-
ling. (Jscillograms show less than one-half cycle arcing
with the arc arrester as against a persistence of five to
eight half cycles under otherwise identical conditions
without it. This example involved tests at 550 volts.
60 cycles with a 7]/2 H.P. motor, rotor locked, as load.
In practical installations but one unit is required for
a three-phase contactor and relief is afforded not only
for the contactor, or linestarter upon which it is
mounted, but also for any disconnect, operating switch,
fuse or other rupturing device connected ahead of the
contactor. ( &gt;n three-phase reversing service but one
"arc arrester" is required as it acts with equal effect-
iveness to relieve either the forward or reversing con-
tactor. 0
SODIUM VAPOR LIGHTING
A new street lighting installation, recently dedicated
along Park Avenue in Port Jervis, New York, sets
a precedent in this country. It is the first ornamental
type of installation of sodium vapor lamps for opera-
tion on alternating current. The project extending for
a distance of one-half mile, provides not only the ap-
plicability of such a lighting system but also a suitable
and attractive entrance to the city.
Twenty-five Westinghouse sodium vapor lamps
spaced 125 feet apart constitute this project. Nominally
rated at 4000 lumens, the lamps are enclosed in heat
insulating vacuum cylinders resembling thermos bottles,
and in turn are surrounded by Bi-lux Bowl reflectors.
Special encolsing globes consisting of light-density
opalescent glass complete the 1x&gt;st-top equipment.
For the operation of these lamps specially designed
transformers are mounted in the base of the post. These
transformers operating on a 6.6 ampere scries primary
circuit deliver through the four-wire secondaries to the
lamp. The two voltages are required for the operation
of each lamp. The series circuit is part of a straight
A.C. system. An automatic clock switch throws in the
lamps at dusk and opens the circuit at dawn. When in
full operation the power consumed is about 100 watts
per lamp, and the overall efficiency is approximately
40 lumens which is almost twice that of the corre-
sponding metallic element filament.
In considering the applicability of such lighting, it
is not so imortant to consider the measured foot candles
as the net seeing ability. Due partially to the lack of
glare and more especially to the monochromatic quality
of the light, it is found that a higher degree of visibil-
ity is obtained than is usually experienced. Due to this
noticable improvement in seeing conditions the sodium
valxir lamp has become subject to considerable thought
as a pioneering development for furthering the prog-
ress of street lighting.

BILL MOHRHOFF
The hero of this biography is our own Michigan
Technic's business manager, Bill Mohrhoff. As it is our
duty to portray in each issue two engineering charac-
ters, Bill was chosen as one of the goats. Now to go on
with his life's story.
Bill was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, At the
age of eleven, Bill and his parents moved to Detroit.
There, he attended Grosse Pointe High School and
worked on the school
1iaper and the school's
annual as the advertis-
ing manager. Athlet-
ics, also, took part of
Bill's time, for he
played in the back-
field on the school's
football team. With
the time left, Bill
showed the rest of the
boys how to shoot
baskets. Yes Sir, Bill
was also a basketball
player! Upon grad-
uating from high
school, Bill received
a cup for excellence
in both athletics and
scholarship.
In 1929 came Bill
to his present Alma Mater, but left at the end of his
first semester. Bill had visions of becoming a second
Admiral Dewey by attending the Naval Academy;
so eastward he went. However, the sea must have
turned Bill's stomach, for back he came only to re-
enter the University in the fall of 1930, this time for
good. He entered the freshman wrestling and wrestled
for awhile, but found that was not quite to his taste.
Bill is a member of Vulcans, Tau Beta Pi and the
A.I.Ch.E. He was on the Slide Rule Ball committee
in 1933 and is on the committee for this years dance.
Bill is a budding chemical engineer, is a member of
Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, and last year was the
chapter president.
His hobbies are a combination of absurdity and in-
terest. You gentle reader, determine which is which.
Bill likes golf and ping pong. As a poker player he is
first rate, and even excells himself when it comes to
playing his favorite seven card stud. Ask him to tell
you of the E.C.M.A. convention. His favorite subjects
are German calculus and "Old Fashioned". Bill dis-
likes liver, but thinks spinach is oke.
We think he has a steady number, because he goes
to Detroit for his dates, a blow to the co-ed to be sure.

ED LEMEN
"The biggest little city in Michigan" according tu
the Rotarians—to the uninitiated this is the burg of
Howell, Michigan and is the birthplace of Ed. Lemen.
Yes Sir, Howell even has a fire station and all the
trimmings of a big city.
In high school, Ed didn't do much, except go out for
the track team during his last month there. Since there
is no more to say, we will skip to the next episode.
I n his freshman
year here at the Uni-
versity, Ed, the track-
man, won three sweat-
ers in intramural com-
petition. He has been
on the track team ever
since, and successful-
ly keeps himself
clothed with sweaters
that he wins. He won
all the campus track
meets in the quarter
mile, his first year.
In the first conference
meet, he placed in the
half mile competition.
Ed was on the fi-
nance committee dur-
ing his freshman year.
He was also one of
the leaders in hazing the sophs as a frosh. and in
hazing the frosh as a sophomore. Ed tried out for
Gargoyle, also, but soon got tired of peddling the local
funny sheet about the campus.
Ed is a chemical engineer and is the president of the
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He was the president of
Triangles and is a member of Michigamua.
Last summer, Ed played horse and pulled a rickshaw
at the World's Fair. From all appearances, he and the
rest of the track boys who pulled sweltering visitors,
had a great time. Ed claims that not only was it
great fun, but very instructive, for many times they
were called upon to tote around the great or near great
figures in our modern age.
Ed's hobbies are easy to satisfy. He likes a lieer
now and then, and plenty of good food. He likes to
play his fiddle but we will not remark upon his play-
ing. He hates the campus co-eds and their attempts at
sophistication. All in all, Ed thinks life is great, and
sees no reason to complain about it in'any way. "Don't
worry about life," remarked Ed. "for it doesn't worry
about you.

THE NEW MAKEUP
This issue of TIIE TECHNIC presents an entirely
new scheme of putting the magazine together. Instead
of starting each article or department at the top of
the page and carrving a continuation to the hack pages
as has been done in the past, all continuations have
been eliminated, each article appearing as a whole on
successive pages. The reader is thus saved some ex-
asperating page turning. The professional journals of
the country have almost all adopted this scheme and
have found it very satisfactory, as have their readers.
Also, College Notes have been eliminated as a de-
partment, the individual college items being distributed
throughout the magazine. We would appreciate your
comments on this new make-up. Do you like it or
don't you? (i ,
CRADES
Grades A-B-C-D-E; What do they mean? Do they
mean the degree of excellence to which a course has
been completed? In some cases they do and in a great
many cases they do not. It is true, I believe, that too
much emphasis has been placed upon grades. When a
student selects a course how often does he think of the
value he will receive? A great many students when
arranging their schedule, pick courses and professors
in which they will get the best grades with the least
amount of work.
In classes they will work the professor instead of
working the course. They will polish the apple and
acquire a pull. We all know of such students as there
seems to be at least one in every class. I dare say,
that every professor, with any sort of humanity in him
at all, has passed several fellows, who on the basis of
scholarship deserve to be flunked. It can readily be
seen that this is unfair to the student who has put forth
sincere effort and acquires the essence of the course
to the same degree as his neighlxir who receives a bet-
ter grade.
It should not be inferred from this that grades should
be based entirely upon examinations. In fact this is in
some cases almost as unfair. When the entire grade in
a course is based upon two or three examinations it
cannot truely represent the extent to which a student
has acquired the course. Yet this is just what is done
in a great many courses.
So you see, this problem of grades is certainly a
puzzling one, both to faculty and students. In some
respects it would be desirable to abolish them. However
if this were done it would be difficult to differentiate
the poor student from the excellent one.
It is true that good grades help to acquire your first
job but after that you have to prove your worth. So
fellows, do not take your grades too seriously.
IN DEFENSE
Now that the din and tumult has died down, we are
loath to renew the topic of the recent fiasco in the auto
lab., yet, neither can we let this matter go entirely un-
commented upon.
At first thought one has faint hope for the advance-
ment of the legal profession when said profession is
joined by the embryonic lawyers who so clearly showed
their true natures on the night of January eleventh,
when thev broke down the doors of the automotive
laboratory in order to put a stop to an Engineering
Research test which was being run there. Only a
moments reflection is needed to assure one that the
leaders of that mob will never sit on the Supreme Court
bench, nor in any other responsible position. Certainly
men who spout legal jargon about "State Property"
and "Public Nuisances", to the befuddlement of repre-
sentatives of the Law, immediately after making a
forcible entry into a State-owned building, and laying
themselves open to charges of malicious destruction of
said State property, will never get very far, except as
shysters.
There was considerable publicity about the affair at
the time, though the true facts of the case have never
seen the light. Most reports complimented the mob,
without consideration of the real issue. The Depart-
ment of Engineering Research needs no brief here, as
we all know how much benefit accrues to the Univer-
sity, the College, and the students, from the activities
of this department. It would seem that these law stu-
dents were just ordinarv rowdies, (or more sensitive
than the women in Martha Cook dormitory), and that
the principles of Governor Rolph of California are
being condoned, if not taught on this campus, as the
attitude would indicate in this case.
W.B.S &amp; W.A.G.
OUR FACULTY
How many of us realize the prominence of our fac-
ulty? It truly can be said that the great majority of
students do not know that they are associating with
men who are authorities in the various phases of-engi-
neering. We go to our classes, mingle with our pro-
fessors, sometimes satisfied, sometimes "griped". We
swear about problems, bluebooks and grades they pass
out but little do we realize that these men are known all
over the country and in many cases the world. In every
department there are men who have achieved a national
reputation in some particular phase of engineering. It
names were to be mentioned it would require a long
column and we reslx;ct fully refer you to the WHO'S
WHO.
Yes. Michigan can truly boast of an excellent faculty.

BySteinar Vaksdal, '34 E
EIGHTEEN years have passed since the Honor
system was inaugurated in the Engineering col-
lege. It came about as the result of a student
petition and was first used on the final examinations of
February 1916. This introduction was preceded by an
investigation of the system in other schools. The Uni-
versity of Virginia with the successful operation of
the system since 1842 furnished the outstanding ex-
ample. A great deal of credit for the initial success of
the system is due to Dean Emeritus, Mortimer E.
Cooley and Robert S. Archer, student leader and first
chairman of the Honor Council. Mr. Archer is now
Director of Metallurgical Research at the A. (). Smith
Corporation, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Has the Honor system stood the test of time? The
accompanying comments should demonstrate that it
has. The all campus poll of last November further
proves this fact. It was gratifying to note that the
large majority of Engineers were in favor of the sys-
tem. It was also interesting to note that the literary stu-
dents favored the estbalishment of a similar system in
their classes. They have made several attempts, in the
past, to install the system but each time they have been
frustrated by the University authorities. Will the fate
of the Honor System be the same as that of the request
for more lenient hours for women? The Engineering
college, of one of the most liberal Universities in the
country, can feel highly complimented that they are
not hampering individualism and forcing students to
conform to rules and regulations in matters they can
best decide for themselves.
No system is perfect and the Honor System is no
exception. There are always a few who will cheat no
matter how closely watched. For those few no system
will work. The remaining students, however, have a re-
sponsibility which will train them to rely u|x&gt;n their
WHAT OTHERS SAY
Perhaps the greatest good of the
Honor System is the increased self-
respect felt by the student. He meets
you in a different way as man to man.
He seeks no favors and asks for only
the things he feels entitled to receive.
He unconsciously walks with his head
higher up, looks one squarely in the
eye and gives one the impression that
he feels a sense of ownership in the
things about him.
MORTIMER E. COOLEY
Dean Emeritus
The responsibility of the engineer
in particular, to the public at large
and to those with whom he comes into
immediate contact, demands that there
should be no question as to his sin-
cerity and character. I am well aware
that many students come to us with
the idea that cribbing in examinations
is not a serious matter, but I consider
that it is our duty as part of their
education, to instill into their minds
that honesty in all things is an abso-
lute necessity in the engineering pro-
fession. Students have told me that
until they came under the Honor Sys-
tem, they did not really appreciate
the fact that dishonesty in small
things might gradually lead to a dull-
ing of a sense of honor which might
lead to serious consequences later on
in life, Granted that there may be oc-
casional failures, the results to the
individuals concerned are often of the
greatest benefit in getting them to see
the errors of their ways.
I am, and always will be, a strong
supporter of the Honor System, as
I consider it an important factor in
building up character.
HERBERT C. SADLER
Dean—lint1inccring College
The Honor System adopted by the
Engineering College has proven to be
a successful measure. The fact that
a student is trusted to work without
being watched gives him a great sense
of responsibility.
Louis WESTOVER
President, Senior Class
The many things I would like to
say for the Honor System may be
summed up in this statement: most
of us in the faculty would much re-
gret having to teach in a college that
has no Honor System.
PROFESSOR A. D. MOORE
//i•cii/ Mentor,
Freshman class
The depression has brought out
many evils in our social and economic
system which, in the last analysis, can
be traced to the character and public
spirit of our citizens. The develop-
ment of the spirit of integrity and
public interest is, therefore, in my
opinion, one of the most important
things that can be accomplished in
our schools. The promulgation of the
Honor System as a principle and the
regulation of certain scholastic affairs
is quite pertinent to this broader
theme.
ROBERT S. ARCHER
Chairman, First
Honor Council
The Student Honor System which
was developed by the student body is
one of the finest traditions ever in-
stituted in this college. It represents
a code of ethics for the Engineer
which he may feel justly proud of.
PROFESSOR AXEL MARIN
Chairman, Faculty
Discipline Committee
My experience with the Honor Sys-
tem and the Honor Council has
proved very gratifying and I believe
the system has definitely shown its
worthiness.
EDWARD JAROS
Chairman, Honor Council
Engineering is a profession which
places responsibility definitely with
the individual.
It is my opinion that the most ef-
fective means of developing this vital
quality is the application of the honor
system as I have experienced it at
this University.
ROBERT S. Fox
President, Sophomore Class
lieing a freshman, I have not had
the opportunity to closely examine the
functions of the Honor System. All
• 1 can say at the present is that it is
a great improvement over the meth-
ods used in most high schools. It gives
a great sense of responsibility to the
freshman.

system is placed entirely in the hands of the students.
A committee made up of representatives from each
class is responsible for its operation. In the eighteen
years of its existance there has been perfect coolxTa-
tion between the faculty and students and both should
he given a pat on the back. It has worked so smoothly
that many students are hardly aware that there is a
system or Honor Committee. The committee has found
that in most cases the violations come from the stu-
dents who have low seholastic record and are struggling
to remain in school. It has also found that students are
reluctant to report the violations. This is really the
only outstanding fault with the system. Any student
dislikes anything that savors of '"squeeling" and it has
been difficult to install the feeling that the cheating
student is robbing the individual members of the class
and lowering the prestige and reputation of Michigan.
It is true I believe that from 90 to 95 percent of the
students stand for honor and fair play. Therefore we
should not allow the minor faults to overshadow the
desirable features. Under the Honor System the dis-
honest student has nothing to put over on the professor,
but by cheating he lowers himself in the estimation of
his classmates. Think of your classmates. Which of
them can you trust implicitly and which of them are
doubtful.
Xow a word about the Honor Council. This is the
judiciary body that tries all cases of violations that are
reported. The council is made up of two representa-
tives from each class. The Council does not try to spy
on students and see how many they can punish or
retire from school. It questions the violators and de-
cides upon a punishment and sends its recommendations
to the faculty committee. To date the faculty commit-
tee have not reversed a decision of the student council.
During the past year 14 cases have been tried. Punish-
ments have varied from probation to expulsion.
From all observations and reports it is evident that
there is much less dishonesty in the Engineering Col-
lege than in the other colleges where the protor system
is in force and no one can truthfully deny this.
The present Honor Council is as follows:
Seniors: Arthur Mosier, Steinar Vaksdal.
Juniors: Edward Jaros (chairman), Russell Houve-
ner (secretary).
Sophomores: Tor Xordenson. Robert Hamman.
FYeshmen: Benjamin Cox, Calvin Stetson.

of Automobile Bodies
By William B. Seens, '34 M.S.E.
The general public has many misconceived ideas re-
garding the effect of a streamlined body upon the per-
formance of an automobile. Engineers are often asked
why so much stress is placed upon the speed attainments
of automobiles, since most cars are capable of speeds
beyond the requirements of most drivers. It is true
that the streamlining of the body will increase the max-
imum speed by reducing the air resistance and thereby
raising the speed at which the engine power is equal to
the power required to drive, but this is not the main
feature of streamlining. A given motor will give much
higher acceleration in the middle speed ranges when
installed in a stream-lined car than it would in a car
of the same weight which is not streamlined. On the
other hand, it is possible to use a much smaller motor
to obtain the same maximum speed and acceleration
characteristics, and to effect a considerable increase in
operating economy in so doing.
An analysis by Professor \V. E. Lay of the Mechan-
ical Engineering Department of the University of
Michigan has revealed that it would require a power
increase of 800% to obtain a speed increase of only
100%, based on the power and speed of a small 1924
automobile; and by extrapolation of curves he has esti-
mated that this speed will be attained by the year 1950,
on the basis of present trends. This increase in engine
power would bring about a decrease in operating econ-
omy that would undoubtedly make the design of such
a power plant ridiculous. The obvious solution is that
some other means than increasing the engine power be
found to continue the trend of increasing performance.
At speeds upwards of fifty miles per hour, the major
portion of the engine power is dissipated into swirling
air. Therefore, the logical angle of attack to the prob-
lem is to reduce the air resistance ... in other words,
to streamline the body.
In 1932, one attempt was made to produce a stream-
lined car, after a satisfactory body form had been
developed by means of tests on models in the University
of Michigan wind tunnel. But, when this car was shown
in 1933, it weighed seven hundred pounds more than its
predecessor, and the price tag read, "$10,000 F.O.B."—
not the car for you and me.
The 1934 cars are showing a saner application of
the principles of practical streamlining, and the public
acceptance of the radical Chrysler line indicates that
this trend is the beginning of a new era in automobile
design. Certain limits are imposed upon the lengths to
which the present trend can go without a further radical
change. Not the least of these limits is the fact that
further reduction of the air resistance coefficient will
require the lengthening of the body, which will produce
an extremely long and unwieldy car. The logical solu-
tion of this problem is to place the motor in the rear
and move the passenger compartment to the front, thus
permitting a fuller realization of the ideal streamlined
form, which requires a relatively long and sloping rear
end.
Further reductions in the air resistance may be
effected by the removal of what Professor Lay has so
aptly termed the "wind claws". There are various gad-
gets and accessories, some necessary and some not,
which clutter up the exterior of the car body. The air
resistance of such items as license plates, trumpet horns.
door handles, and door hinges may seem to be trivial,
but their total effect is quite considerable. The reader
may gain an appreciation of this fact by holding an old
license plate out of the window of a car travelling at,
say, sixty miles per hour. One instance on the part of
manufacturers failing to consider these wind claws is
to be noted on a specially streamlined 1934 custom car
which has in excess of twenty-four square inches of
door hinges sticking out into the air-stream. The cor-
rect application of streamlining requires that the head-
lights be sunk into the front fenders, that the door
handles and hinges be recessed into the door panels, and
that all gadgets be either eliminated or faired into the
general body contour. License plates should be placed
in pockets in the rear of the car, and recessed into the
front fenders, which would not only eliminate the air
resistance of the plates, but also would foil car thieves.
To carry this a point further, the plates might even be
sealed in by State officials.
Wind tunnel tests by the Bureau of Standards have
revealed that the effect of other than straight ahead
winds are of increasing importance as the speeds of
driving increase. To date, very little attention has been
paid to the removal of running boards and other flat
surfaces from the sides of the car bodies. It is a well
known fact that the wind is seldom "dead ahead" under
normal driving conditions, and consideration of this
fact leads one to believe it not unlikely that an entirely

new type of body must be developed to overcome the
effect of side winds. This new type of body may take
the form of a swivelled body which will turn itself into
the resultant wind (and make every automobile ride
like a day at the Fair) or perhaps, the desired results
may be obtained by the use of a movable fin. However,
quite satisfactory results would be obtained by rounding
of the sides to give a closer approximation of the form
of an airplane fuselage.
During the past several years, series of tests have
been conducted at the University of Michigan, under
the direction of Professor Lay, to determine exactly
the effects of air resistance on car performance. These
tests have varied from wind tunnel tests on small scale
models to the road testing of a full-sized model. The
wind tunnel work included the effects of various wheel
housings, various radii of curvature of the edges, and
the effect of variations of the angle of the resultant
wind, besides the determination of the lift and drag
characteristics of the model test car. In this wind tunnel
work a suction plate was used to simulate as nearly as
possible a road surface, and some of the testing was
done by the reflection method, in which two identical
models are placed base to base.
At present an attempt is being made to correlate the
results of the wind tunnel tests to the testing of the full-
sized test car.
About the regular coupe body of this test car was
built a "floating envelope" in the form of a rectangular
box which completely encloses the car except for the
wheels. The entire envelope is suspended as a unit from
the bumper brackets by means of four sheets of spring
steel, leaving the envelope free to move a few inches
backward or forward. When the inside car is driven
forward, the air forces tend to move the envelope to the
rear. Through linkage to a counterbalanced and cali-
brated "Toledo" scale, the air force on the envelope
may be measured. It is interesting to note the fact that
the air resistance of the envelope is considerably less
than that of the coupe body alone, in spite of the ob-
viously greater size of the envelope.
A mast carries three pitot tubes above and ahead
of the car, these tubes being connected to differential
manometers. One of these tubes is a regular air-speed
indicator, connected to a manometer calibrated to indi-
cate the velocity of the head wind on the envelope. The
other two tubes are set at right angles to each other,
and at 45° to the direction of
travel, and connected to a ma-
nometer calibrated to indicate
the direction of the resultant
wind in relation to the direction
of car travel.
The scale and manometers,
and a blackboard for recording
other data, are grouped on the
rear deck of the coupe, and on
these instruments is focused a movie camera which is
used for the recording of data.
Two test courses have been surveyed and marked.
Since these two courses are at right angles to each other,
and over different terrain, a wide variety of wind con-
ditions is available. A rather steady wind is desirable
for this work, so testing is done only when favorable
weather conditions permit. Because of the large flat
side areas of the envelope, we frequently wish for a
joy-stick instead of a steering wheel, in gusty wind.
The method of testing consists in driving the test
car up and down over the test course. The test squad
consists of two men: one to do the driving, and the
other to handle the recording instruments. To eliminate
acceleration or deceleration forces, the throttle is fixed
to give approximately the desired speed before the car
enters upon the measured mile. As the starting line is
crossed, a stop-watch is started, and the camera snapped.
Additional photographic readings are taken every
twentieth of a mile until the watch is stopped at the
end of the mile. After every second run, observations
and readings arc taken at the small portable weather
bureau which is set up at one end of the course.
All of this testing is done on public highways, so
the test runs are not without excitement. During the
slow speed runs, curiosity-seekers have a maddening
habit of pulling up alongside, or, worse still, just ahead
and right under the pitot tubes. This makes testing just
a waste of time, as we want our manometers to register
undisturbed air currents and not other people's tail-
eddies. As for the matter of dodging traffic at the
higher speeds—with fixed throttle—the less said, the
better. Anyway, we manage to keep out of "Chapter
Eternal".

Structures by the Pendulum
A Review of Recent French Developments
by Winston M. Dudley (University Fellow in Engineering Mechanics)
Introduction
The application of the theory of strength of mate-
rials to assembled rigid systems encounters difficulties,
always great and frequently insurmountable, especially
in the case of statically indeterminate structures. Al-
though, in principle, there always exists a unique and
complete solution for the behavior of any such system
under load, the calculations are always laborious and
frequently it is impossible to extricate the desired form-
ulae. In the face of these difficulties, the usual method
is to simplify the problem by neglecting all the unknown
forces whose effects are thought to be secondary and
whose inclusion complicates the calculations.
One problem very frequently encountered is how to
allow for the eccentricities of loading introduced by the
attachments on the ends of the members, by which a
framework is held together. These variations can only
be formulated in a very approximate manner, but it is
known in certain simple cases that they give rise to
stresses fully as large as those whose values are found
by assuming that the frame is pin-jointed. Since it is
the sum of all the stresses at a point which must not pass
the elastic limit of the material, it is seen that small
confidence can be placed in results obtained by using the
simplified formulae and applying an arbitrary "factor
of safety'', which has been truly called a factor of
ignorance.
Since exact theoretical analysis of such cases is
complicated, results can often be obtained more quickly
and easily by experimental methods. Even if the ulti-
mate structure being considered is of great size, the
theory and experimental technique of model-testing has
now reached a point such that very reliable data can be
obtained. Since models may be either larger or smaller
than the original, a convenient size can always be pro-
duced and the problem reduces to testing such a model.
It might appear at first sight that the simplest way
of determining the stiffness and capacity load of the
model would be to apply known static loads and meas-
ure the resulting deflection. This method is extremely
simple in concept, but several serious objections are
uncovered when one attempts to apply it. First, the
displacements of very rigid structures are quite small
and delicate measurements must be made to record
them; and second, most cases which require the use of
model tests are three-dimensional problems, and thus no
standardization of methods of applying loads is possible.
Experimental Method
Both of these objections can be avoided by making
the test dynamically. It has long been known that if
two identical simple vibrating systems (such as pendu-
lums) Ix: attached to an elastic structure and one of
the two be started swinging, the other begins to swing
and its amplitude builds up slowly to a maximum, after
which it decreases to zero, only to build up again. The
first system meanwhile has been going through an in-
verse cycle. This interchange of energy between the
pendulums is known as "beating" and it goes on until
the motion is completely damped out by air friction and
other energy losses. The systems must oscillate in the
same plane and they must be attached to the same point
of the structure. If these conditions are satisfied, a
very simple relation exists between the time of "beat-
ing", the period of one pendulum by itself and the
stiffness of the elastic structure in the direction in which
the systems oscillate. If pendulums are used, this rela-
tion is:
4ir- m t
k = , where t is the time between successive
T3
stops of the same pendulum, T is the natural period of
one pendulum by itself, m is the mass of one pendu-
lum (it is assumed that the pendulums are ideal simple
pendulums) and k is the stiffness (force per unit de-
flection) of the structure at the point of support and
in the direction of oscillation of the pendulums. It is
assumed that t is large compared to T, a condition easily
realized in practice. Simple corrections permit taking
account of factors, if any, whose influence is generally
weak: vertical accelerations, radius of gyration of the
pendulums, amplitude, reaction of inertia in the sup-
port. The latter is usually small, not because the struc-
ture has no mass, but because stresses and strains are
propagated in an elastic substance with the velocity of
sound, and the time required for this is usually very
small compared to T.
As has been said, the pendulum method meets both
the objections which confront the static method; time is
measured instead of deflections, and no clumsy or spec-

pendulums can be affixed to a short, stiff horizontal bar
and the latter can then be clamped to any structure
which it is desired to test. Furthermore the motions of
the structure itself are small, and it suffers no harm
from the test.
Results
The application of the pendulum method to rigidity
problems is fairly new, and very few test results have
been published. It is immediately seen, however, that
certain problems of great practical interest can be solved
in this way. Among these are:
(1) Determination of the modulus of elasticity of a
material.
(2) Determination of the construction which has
the maximum of rigidity for a given amount of
material. (Fuselages, bridges, steel towers
etc.)
(3) Influence of cross-members and wire bracing
on the foregoing type of structure.
(4) Relative effectiveness of various types of con-
nections, such as rivets, bolts and welds.
(5) Variation with time of the rigidity of an artic-
ulated structure (with a view to predicting ulti-
mate failure by a previous lessening of rigid-
ity.)
Modulus of Elasticity
The pendulum method is well suited to the deter-
mination of this quantity, since a test can be made very
quickly. The specimen, in the form of a cylinder of
circular or some other simple cross-section, is fastened
rigidly at its base, and the pendulum system is clamped
to the top, so that the arrangement resembles a T, with
the pendulums at the extremities of the cross bar and
swinging in the plane of the T. The time of beating
of the pendulums is observed, after which the modulus
is obtained by using the formula:
4*-m I8t
E = , where 1 is the distance from the
3 IT3
lower end of the specimen to the plane of the knife-
edges of the pendulums, and I is the moment of inertia
of the specimen for bending in the plane of the T. This
formula can be derived directly from the previously-
given one by equating k to the well-known stiffness of
a simple cantilever beam.
This method is especially suited to determining the
modulus of such materials as cast iron, whose stress-
strain curve is not straight, but curves continually as
the strain is increased. (This implies that the modulus
is a function of strain, instead of being a constant as
is usually assumed.) In the pendulum test, the strain
in the specimen usually does not exceed 10-5, so that the
modulus determined in this way actually gives the slope
of the stress-strain curve at the origin. To determine
this slope by static testing would require very precise
extensometers and careful work, whereas the pendulum
method gives it quickly and to any desired degree of
accuracy, with a minimum of labor.
Most Efficient Use of Metal
No experiments have been made at Michigan on the
other four problems previously mentioned, but the paper
by MM. Le Holland et Sorin gives the results of several
short investigations under these headings. As the re-
sults are interesting and of some practical importance,
they will be reviewed briefly.
The pendulum method can be applied very effective-
ly to help in the redesign of framed structures. Small
parts like those of a toy Erector set can be assembled
in various manners, and the rigidity of any particular
arrangement quickly determined.
Of course the usefulness of any arrangement de-
pends on the total load it can carry without damage, as
well as on the rigidity. But here again the pendulum
method is useful. The model, after being assembled, is
subjected by some means to cyclic loads or deflections,
and the rigidity is determined at frequent intervals as
the test proceeds, by means of the pendulums.
Effect of Wire Bracing
Records were made of the rigidity of small frames
with diagonal bracing wires both before and during
cyclic testing. The effect of initial tension was particu-
larly studied, with the interesting result that increased
initial tension in wire bracing adds absolutely nothing
to the rigidity of a structure. It may in fact be harm-
ful, as the wire is sure to receive additional tension
when the structure is loaded, and the total of these
effects may be beyond the elastic limit.
The usual theory of wire bracing assumes that the
wires do not directly affect the displacement of the
structure; the distortion of the latter is calculated as
though no wires were present, the resulting stretch in
the wires is found and the forces produced by them
added in. This theory was found to agree very well
with experimental results.
Rivets vs. Bolts vs. Welds
Two narrow pieces of plate were joined by each of
the three methods, and the resulting joints tested to
destruction under cyclic loading, with frequent stops
to determine rigidity. The joints were so designed that
the static strength compared favorably with that of a
onepiece specimen ; the dynamic behavior, however, was
quite different. The riveted joint showed a continual
small decrease of rigidity with repeated load-cycles, ex-
tending from the beginning until a large increase oc-
curred just before rupture. The welded and bolted
specimens, by contrast, showed no diminution of rigid-
ity over a several hours' destruction test until within
a few minutes of failure.

By Prof. Walter C. Sadler
Admiralty jurisdiction consists of that branch of the
law vested with a maritime interest. Its rules of pro-
cedure and statutory provisions are distinctly different
from other jurisdictions, and the scope of its authority
must be accurately determined. The laws governing
maritime commerce are of great antiquity. Our modern
admiralty law appears to be the outgrowth of the old
consular courts, which were dominated by the then
leading merchants of the sea ports. It is natural, there-
fore, that the growth of the law should have been par-
ticularly sensitive to the changing needs of commerce.
There is some authority for the theory that admiralty
law was based upon the needs of a lien applicable to
things afloat, which theory, in itself, is indicative of
the fact that the jurisdiction has been sufficiently flex-
ible to meet the changing requirements of maritime
commerce down through the years.
On first thought it might appear simple to differen-
tiate between those matters concerning the high seas
and those relating to the land. But the powerful land
courts have ever been jealous of their jurisdiction as
such, always demanding an accurate allocation of the
border line cases. It should be clearly understood that
the adjudication of admiralty law is a federal matter
and not one for the individual states.
The test of jurisdiction will be determined by the
cause of the action and not by the remedy, and in this
respect is the antithesis of the test for equity jurisdic-
tion. For instance, two litigants of the same state will
be under admiralty jurisdiction if the subject matter of
their controversy concerns the high seas.
The "high seas" is a catch phrase which has been
used from time immemorial to designate the jurisdiction
of admiralty law. It is evident, however, that the phrase
must be broadly interpreted. The many controversies
concerning shipping in harbors and terminals are ex-
amples. This is the very type of jurisdiction which
should be included in admiralty law. High seas must
therefore be extended to include tide waters. But even
the term "tide waters" offers some difficulty of interpre-
tation, as in the case of a river flowing into the ocean.
A ship comes up the river to a dock located downstream
from the furthermost point reached by salt water at
high tide. Suppose now that the ship is burned at the
dock, when the salt water has receded with the ebb of
the tide and the ship is afloat on fresh water. Should
admiralty law apply to the resulting insurance litiga-
tion? It seems evident that it should.
Xone of these "rule of thumb" tests appears satis-
factory, for the basic reason of the rule is lost from
view. Admiralty law was conceived for the single pur-
pose of regulating shipping, and the courts should take
cognizance of this purpose. The ship afloat should ever
remain a matter of admiralty jurisdiction, irrespective
of location, and the real test should turn on the naviga-
bility of the water. This is the American law, and is
limited by two exceptions. The body of water must be
navigable to other states of foreign countries, and sec-
ondly, it must be open to vessels of at least ten tons
burden. This latter limitation is merely designed on
practical considerations to eliminate land-locked lakes
and small streams to which federal jurisdiction would
be clearly inapplicable.
If a sailor boards a ship at anchor, secures a job
and sails, it is evident that the entire transaction was
negotiated on navigable waters and the resulting con-
tract should be governed by the rules of admiralty juris-
diction. But the interesting cases are not as simple as
this. The contract may involve a seaman's employment
signed on shore a mile from the dock. Since the gen-
eral rule is that contracts are governed by the locus of
execution, it would appear that admiralty is inapplica-
ble. But this is clearly an unsatisfactory solution of the
problem involving a matter of the high seas. The courts
have appreciated the correct analysis of this situation,
and always determine the jurisdiction upon the nature
of the subject matter. If the subject matter is mari-

Aground—a subject for admiralty law.

logical and easily clears up many controversies.
Reed vs. Weule, 176 Fed. 660 involved litigation
over the sale of a chronometer for a particular ship.
.Although the sale was completed on land, admiralty law
applied because the subject matter was maritime. It
was part of the process of fitting a ship on the high seas.
The records are full of decisions of this nature. All
repair bills for ships afloat appear clearly of a maritime
nature. However, how should such bills be handled if
the vessel is placed in a floating dry dock, or even in
a dry dock on shore? Application of the maritime test
sets this class of litigation within admiralty jurisdiction
and such, in fact, is the law. Much litigation is possible
during the construction of a new ship, and in such cases
it is necessary to determine whether admiralty law is
applicable. The test is the launching of the ship, that is
to say, as long as it is in the dry dock, the ship is under
the law of the land. This is a reasonable and workable
rule, for otherwise we would have admiralty law ap-
plying to the steel mills of Pittsburgh and the rope
walks of distant cities.
Injuries occurring at the unloading of ships have
led to considerable controversies due to the different
rules of workmen's compensation on land and at sea.
The actual unloading of a ship, whether by ships tackle
or shore cranes, is distinctly a maritime activity and
should be treated as such. The removal of the goods
from the dock is a land activity, and this applies even
when the contract calls for a combined rail-water
transport.
The case of Phillips vs. Rawlins, 2 Hawaii, 150,
presents an interesting situation wherein the litigation
involved the proper jurisdiction in the matter of sealers.
The occupation of seal hunting involves considerable
sailing from port to port, as well as the killing of seals
and the rendering of the blubber on shore. The issue
turned on whether the entire operation constituted a
matter of the high seas, and the court correctly held
that it was of a maritime nature and should come under
admiralty law.
The reason for the numerous controversies as to
admiralty jurisdiction lies in the difference between
the federal and state laws. One of two litigants may see
a personal advantage in federal jurisdiction, and in
border-line cases, he will try to force the litigation into
admiralty. But the tests of today are very logical, and
they result in an established and workable set of rules.
Electron Emitting Alloys
of Nickel and Barium
By Dr. R. A. Wolfe, Research Physicist, Dcpt. of Engineering Research
Experimental work on the development of electron
emitting alloys of nickel and barium has been carried
out in the Department of Engineering Research of the
University of -Michigan for a number of years. This

Laboratory devoted to the study of electron emitting alloys.
line of investigation developed from extensive re-
searches on the use of special alloys for the severe con-
ditions encountered in spark plug electrodes. While
making the study on spark plug electrode materials cer-
tain new and promising properties were noticed. For
example, it was found that the alloys were very resistant
to corrosion and maintained their ability to emit elec-
trons while hot after long usage and under very severe
conditions. The development of such stable alloys hav-
ing electron emitting properties is of interest because
of their adaptability to use in vacuum tubes. Later, it
was found possible to devote considerable time to this
study and a number of interesting factors were dis-
covered.
The first developments resulted in the production
of alloys containing small amounts of barium, from .02
per cent to .20 per cent. The remaining composition
was approximately 98 per cent nickel, .5 to 2.0 per cent
manganese, and traces of carbon, iron, and silicon as
impurities. Recent developments have extended the
barium range to as high as 10 per cent. For the lower

sufficient tests have not been made to say with certainty
that the higher percentage barium mixtures are true
alloys. The distribution of barium throughout the metal
is very uniform and no measurable variation in the
composition of samples cut at random from large coils
of wire is found, nor is there any segregation detectable
under the microscope. The uniformity of composition
has been carefully followed by using highly developed
spectroscopic technique and very small variations could
thus be easily detected if they were present.
The alloys were made in a 35 Kva Northrup high
frequency furnace in carbon-free crucibles. Great care
was taken to have very pure materials and in many
instances de-gassed metals were used.' The samples
were hot rolled into wire .072 in. in diameter and the
thermionic emission tests were made on samples of this
size.
The first measurements on the thermionic emission
from nickel-barium-manganese alloys failed to show a
regular variation of the electron current with the barium
content. Detailed spectroscopic analysis revealed the
presence of small amounts of impurities that had rela-
tively large influences on the thermionic emission. Iron,
carbon, silicon, and titanium were found to greatly in-
fluence the total amount of thermionic emission ob-
tained. Iron and titanium apparently inhibit the ther-
mionic emission obtainable while carbon and silicon
greatly increase the rate of evaporation of the alloy at
the operating temperature. Excess evaporation removes
the emitting surface and thus rapidly cuts down the total
emissivity.
It was found that the addition of about 3 per cent
of chromium greatly retards evaporation and permits
the formation of a very stable emitting surface. The
electrical sensitivity of the alloys containing chromium
is greater than for pure nickel and thus the cross sec-
tion of wires used in radio vacuum tubes must be in-
creased to retain the same voltage rating. This may be
of value because of the increased area of the emitting
surface.
The alloys having small amounts of barium, .08 to
.15 per cent have been found very desirable for use as a
base metal for oxide coated emitters. When the surface
of the alloy is oxidized slightly before the application
of the oxides, the coating is found to adhere very tightly
and uniformly, and because of the low evaporation rate
insures stability over a long period of time.
Recently alloys containing approximately 1 per cent
of barium have been made and tested and it has been
found that with proper procedure they can be made to
give emissions comparable with that obtained from
oxide coated emitters. These alloys are used uncoated.
It can easily be seen that the use of uncoated emitter
wire for vacuum tube filaments should result in a con-
siderable saving to the tube manufacturers. This ma-
terial is practically free from any kind of surface
contamination, can not flake off during use, is remark-
ably uniform in operating characteristics from filament
to filament, does not need to be used at any particular
date after manufacture, eliminates the extra operations
due to oxide coating, and cuts finished tube rejections
to a very low point. At a proper operating temperature
they are remarkably free from gas and have a satisfac-
torv life.
TAU BETA PI
The first bi-weekly meeting for the present semester,
of Tau Beta Pi, engineering honorary fraternity, was
held at the Union on February 20.
Unfortunately, no agreement was reached on Pres-
ident Eveland's topic for discussion, namely, a system
of grading where the A's, B's, C's, D's, and E's, are
reserved for the secretary's office, the student being
given merely a passing or not-passing grade. In the
course of the discussion it became quite evident that
Prof. A. D. Moore was decidedly in favor of the present
system.
In addition to other routine business, the following
committee appointments were made: Joseph Wagner.
'35, to replace Dennis Shepherd, on the Faculty Com-
mittee. Adrian Broggini, '34, Joseph Bennett, '34, Rob-
ert Merritt, '34, Kenneth Rowland. '34. and Julio Ygle-
sias, for the Election Committee. Robert Harrison, '34,
Maurice Demers, '35, Kenneth Roe, '34, Wesley Mc-
Mullen, '34, and Henry Merker, '35, for the Formal
Initiation Committee; and Richard Liskow, '34, and
Frank Highley, '34, to comprise the Informal Initiation
Committee.
VULCANS
The senior engineering honorary society, \ ulcans,
was addressed by Mr. Max Demorest of the Geology
Department on February 18 at one of its customary
dinner meetings. Mr. Demorest, who was a member of
the last expedition to Greenland, spoke about the Eski-
mo life, the topography of the land there, and the
glacial ice. His account of icebergs and his description
of seal hunting were particularly interesting. Para-
doxical as it may seem, one member of the expedition
experienced the coldest temperature he ever experi-
enced,—no, not in Greenland, but in Iron Mountain,
Michigan, so Max Demorest said. This, he explained,
is due to the fact that although Greenland is usually
regarded as an extremely cold region, it is not sub-
jected to such extreme temperatures as some people
think. The glacial ice is there because of the relatively
low-temperature average for the whole year. He added
that in the summer the thermometer rarely reaches 60
degrees.

STAN SMITH
Michigan's star glider pilot, Stan Smith, was born
in Garland, New York and was educated in a little red-
brick schoolhouse. Stan received his college preparatory
work in Brockport High School. Besides playing bas-
ketball for three years, he played the sax in the
school orchestra. If we should be questioned, we would
say that is the one dark spot on his career. Stan also
made model airplanes, and with his models, he won
two contests that enabled
him to enter the final
contests at the Ford Air-
port, Detroit.
Finishing high school,
Stan entered the Me-
chanics Institute at
Rochester, Xew York.
For one whole year, he
didn't study and received
all A's. The tough part
of the whole thing,
though, was that he ob-
tained no credit at the
University upon trans-
ferring.
The first thing that
Stan did upon entering
the University of Michi-
gan was to join the
Glider Club, and in his
sophomore year was instructing fledglings how to
fly the gol darned thing. This year Stan is the pres-
ident of the club and has an enviable record behind him.
During the National Soaring Meet in 1932, he won
first place for duration with a utility glider by remain-
ing in the air eight hours and twenty minutes, the only
reason he came down when he did was because it was
getting too dark to see.
Last year the club won the Fairchild Trophy for
group endurance, and Stan won first place in both alti-
tude and distance. Though the depression caused the
cash prizes to become non-existent Stan, nevertheless,
has won many instruments with his flights.
Naturally, Stan is an aeronautical engineer. How-
ever, Stan's interests do not stop with gliding. He is a
member of Phi Eta Sigma, Triangles, Tau Beta Pi, and
is on the engineering Council. He belongs to Sigma
Alpha Epsilon Fraternity.
Stan has no use for the campus co-eds. His interest
lies back in Rochester, New York. We understand that
Stan expects to get "hitched" this summer, but that
will in no way cut down his flying speed.

STAN SMITH
FRED KOHL
The warlord of the campus, Fred Kohl, instead of
being born on the island of Corsica like Napoleon, just
saw the light of day in Perrysburg, Ohio. Unable to
stand the peace and quiet of his birthplace, Fred packed
his B-B gun and moved to Bowling Green, Ohio, the
scene of many a shotgun's roar and hasty retreat of
ardent swain.
Basketball, football, and Hi-Y were the Generalissi-
mo's chief activities in
high school. Moreover,
he aspired to dramatic
heights and once played
in "The Patsy." He was
his class president and
upon graduating was
presented with the class
memorial.
For a year after grad-
uating, Fred attended
Bowling Green College
and there played on
the varsity basketball
team. While there, Fred
I&gt;ecame enraptured by
the stories that his
brother told him about
the University, and de-
cided to become a stu-
dent in his present Alma
Mater.
A man of his word, this soldier of fortune came
north and enrolled in the Engineering College the fol-
lowing autumn. At once the battle for success was
commenced, and Fred has ever since been collecting the
spoils of victory. Fred is Cadet Colonel of the Univer-
sity of Michigan R.O.T.C. regiment, is captain of the
Scabbard and Blade, and is this year's Military Ball
chairman.
This conquering mechanical engineer is the presi-
dent of the A.S.M.E. Regarding honorary societies,
there is nothing lacking either, for Fred belongs to Tau
Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, and is an associate member of
Sigma Xi. Fred is also on the Engineering Council
this year.
Delta Tau Delta, Fred's fraternity, lies across the
street from the Arboretum. Though an almost-woman-
hater himself, Fred, each May, sees his classmates trod
down lovers lane. How he can resist the temptation to
follow is beyond our means to determine.
Fred has no vices, so he tells us. He just enjoys
fooling around with old model T Fords.

FINIS
March again writes finis to another TECHNIC staff.
The April issue will see a new group turning the mag-
azine out—a not too experienced group but one full of
eagerness. We often think how incorrect it is that a
staff must drop their positions after gaining so much
experience in their year's work. But this advantage is
completely overbalanced by another virtue which an in-
coming staff always brings with them in abundance—
enthusiasm.
The outgoing staff came in with many hopes and
ambitions. Some were realized and some were not. As
is true everywhere, many rosy hopes fade away before
the starkness of everyday realism. All through the year
an attempt has been made to keep the magazine as up
to date and varied as possible. Even though working in
the cramped limits of a twenty or twenty-four page
magazine, we have, each month, presented at least four
feature articles and special attention was given to keep-
ing them as varied as possible as to content. Last month
initiated an entirely new make-up scheme, that of elim-
inating continuations. Leading professional journals
all over the country have adopted this "continuation
elimination" method and from reports on the first trial
given the scheme in THE TECHNIC the idea has taken
hold here with a firm grip.
Special attention was given to "College Notes" and
attempts made to make them as numerous as possible.
The Editors believe this is one of the vital departments
of the magazine and that it deserves much attention.
The fact that these notes are now distributed through-
out the magazine does not lessen their attraction.
We have also tried to give a good cross section of the
Senior Engineering Class, presenting each month two
outstanding students in The Engineering Spotlight.
These are always interesting reading for the boy's fel-
low students.
Grasping this last opportunity, the Publication
Board would like to thank the Faculty Advisory Board
for their hearty cooperation and their many helpful
suggestions. Also our sincere thanks go to both the
Senior and Junior staffs for the excellent work they
have done—they are a great bunch and it is with a feel-
ing of surety that we pass the magazine on to them.
"Incoming staff, may good luck and success attend you."
SOME ONE IS OUT OF STEP
It is a well known theory that the engineer has so
expanded and mechanized our living that we can't keep
up with it, and that if there had never been any engi-
neers we would all be now living happily without de-
pressions. True as this is, it is an absurd thing to take
for an argument, for it can, in effect, be considered as
an admission that civilization should have remained at
the cave-man level. This idea was accepted generally,
even before the depression. High School students were
often urged to enter business rather than engineering
which was supposed to be a declining profession.
The real trouble is that business and government
have failed to keep up with the rest of the world. All
the technical professions, among them Science, Engi-
neering, Medicine, and even the Arts have never stopped
progressing, and today have reached levels never before
attained. But in the meanwhile, business and govern-
ment have chugged along in the same old channels, fail-
ing to adapt themselves to present conditions.
It would be fine if the engineers, and doctors, and
musicians could go happily along developing their pro-
fessions towards perfection, and let business and gov-
ernment go hang; but our civilization isn't built that
way. Because the business man works his possessions
for the maximum personal gain, and because the gov-
ernment official follows his time-honored traditions, no-
lxxly from the farmer and his necessity-of-life potatoes
to the artist and his what-is-it modernistic paintings
can live and make his contributions to civilization as
well as he might.
Obviously we are getting along in fair shape ; a com-
parison of technical attainments over the years shows
that; but to the engineering mind, unused possibilities
and inefficient systems are obnoxious. Such results of
the present economic system as buying wheat to burn,
plowing under cotton, and pouring milk down sewers,—
when an attempt is made to analyze them for a logical
solution, tend to tear the engineering mind from its
moorings and send it bumping off through space. It's
no wonder that Milt Gross' man from Mars, after tak-
ing a look at the earth says "Ay tank ay go home". It
is obviously time that the engineer who, having done his
part and suffered because someone else didn't do his,
apply some of his reasoning where it will do the most
good. P.R.E.

General Electric
Mounting of motor for testing Airplane Propellers
MOTOR TESTS AIRCRAFT PROPELLERS
FOR NOISE
One of the latest achievements for the advancement
of aviation is the use of motors for testing airplane
propellers for noises. This recent method is now em-
ployed at Langley Field, Virginia. The device is an
induction motor housed in a cigar shaped steel casing
with a shaft extension for the direct mounting of a
propeller. It will be used to investigate the noise made
by various types of propellers with a view to designing
a propeller in which the noise is reduced to the practical
minimum.
In order to accomplish this the motor had to be
designed so that its speed could be accurately controlled
over a range from 1000 to 3600 r.p.m. This is accom-
plished by means of two complete sets of 13-point drum
control, electrically connected so that one acts as a ver-
nier between each pair of points of the other. A small
generator connected within the casing is wired to a dis-
tant meter, calibrated to indicate the exact speed of the
motor.
As the propeller is tested, the sound waves are re-
ceived by a microphone and analyzing apparatus so
that a complete study of noises can be made. To make
it possible to receive the sound waves emanating from
the various angles of the blades without having to move
the microphone equipment, the motor is mounted on a
swiveling pedestal. Both the pedestal and casing are
streamlined to reduce resistance to the air stream and
to minimize the reflection of sound waves.
The motor itself is probably one of the first of its
kind ever built. It is of the wound rotor induction
type, rated 200 h.p. at 3600 r.p.m. It is of 2-pole,
3-phase design and operates at 60 cycles and 2300 volts.
Difficult problems in design were encountered in that the
motor and all its fittings had to fit in a 30-inch diameter
casing.

CRANKLESS DIESEL ENGINE
Eliminating crankshaft, connecting rods, cylinder
heads, gaskets, valves, and camshafts, a new high speed
crankless horizontal diesel of the Sterling Engine Co.
may forecast revolutionary designs for future diesel
engines. The weight of this new design is 13 to 20 Ibs.
per brake-horse-power in contrast to the usual 40 to 50
lbs. Moreover, the fuel is guaranteed at .43 lbs. per
brake-horse-power.
Instead of using the customary crankshaft, the en-
gine uses the angle plate disk principle. The engine
consists of four cylinders each with two opposed recip-
rocating pistons, which is the equivalent of a 2-cycle,
8-cylinder engine of the conventional type. The cylin-
ders are arranged about a straight drive shaft carrying
inclined disks at each end,—the disks being virtually
flywheels, rigidly attached to the drive shaft in a per-
manently inclined position. Mechanical bearing units
transferring the power to the drive shaft use a bridge
passing over the rim of the wheel and touching the rim
in either side. The bearing surface on the thrust side
is of babbit metal mounted on a half-sphere. The bear-
ing on the other side which serves as a guide is a hemi-
spherical bronze piece.
During operation the air which enters through cir-
cumferential ports (thus eliminating pistons) is com-
pressed to 500 Ibs. per square inch and then the fuel is
sprayed in at 1500 lbs. per square inch. The engine is
started similarly to gasoline engines,—by a 24 or 32
volt starter, and is capable of speeds ranging from 200
to 1800 r.p.m.
Involved in this new design are many new features.
The air intake occurs in the form of a swirling charge
in order to clean the cylinder. Also the air enters at
one end and leaves at the other providing uniform flow.
The ends of the pistons are slightly concaved to prevent
the fuel spray from impinging on the crown. Out of
phase pistons provide longer combustion interval with
approximately the same volume. Horizontal opposed
pistons are conducive to smoothness and the absence of
a crankshaft eliminates side thrust, piston wear, and
torsional vibration.

Modern trends in automobile streamlining find an-
other advocate in a new prefocused lamp that permits
smaller headlights and contrihutes to better styling of
car fronts.
Streamlining the headlights means reflectors of
smaller diameter. In order to obtain a desirable reflec-
tor efficiency with these smaller designs, it has been
necessary to reduce their focal length to 1% inches,
which is from '/&amp; to l/4 inches shorter than in the con-
ventional type reflectors. Consequently, the light center
had to be positioned more accurately so as to preserve
light control, hence the new prefocusing base.
In Westinghouse Mazda Headlight lamps, the new
prefocusing base consists of a collar rigidly fastened to
the base. Three slots unequally spaced around this collar
are engaged by three small pins projecting through the
flat section at the apex of the headlight reflector.
Springs behind the reflector exert a pressure in these
pins to hold the bulb firmly in position. Since the pins
and slots are spaced unequally, the lamp can only be
inserted when they match in the correct position. The
lamp is inserted the same way as the standard bayonet
bulb, namely, by pushing in and rotating clockwise to
engage the pins in the slot openings.
The new prefocused base headlight lamps, in making
possible smaller auto headlamps without the loss of
lighting efficiency, are expected to contribute largely
to progress of streamlining, since it is the front of cars
which must perhaps undergo the greatest transforma-
tion in style changes.
FLOATING BANANA PLATTERS
Some tall yarns have been told about river boats
that could float on a heavy dew, but to match this we
find that in New Orleans, twenty-seven barges were
recently built which do not require much more moisture
for sailing. Although they are sixty feet long and made
of steel they draw only six inches of water.
The barges were built for service in transporting
bananas on the shallow rivers of Central America. They
are sixty feet long, twenty feet wide and three feet
deep. In order to withstand the corrosive action of the
salt water, the hulls and decks of these floating platters
were made of sheets of Armco iron one-eighth of an
inch thick, welded together.
VACUUM TUBE RELAY USED AS GLUE DETECTOR
Vacuum tubes are becoming more and more impor-
tant in industry, and one of the most recent applications
shows their usefulness even in very simple operations.
A western supply company which manufactures box
ends from scrap lumber experienced considerable diffi-
culty through having some ends pull apart because of
lack of glue. It was practically impossible to detect the
absence of glue after the grooved pieces had been
pressed together.
A vacuum tube detector was devised in cooperation
with engineers of the General Electric Company. Steel
piano wire contacts were drawn through the grooves in
such a manner that the circuit had to be completed
through the glue. This circuit is connected to the grid
of an amplifier tube, which in turn controls a sensitive
relay. As long as there is glue in the grooves, nothing
happens. But as soon as the circuit is opened by the
absence of glue, the relay operates to ring a bell and
light a lamp. Operators can immediately then rectify
the trouble.
X-RAY INSPECTS WELDS
A piece of apparatus that resembles Mr. Edison's
talking machine is now doing the biggest industrial x-
ray job yet attempted, the minute inspection of every
inch of steel welds in the penstocks of the Hoover Dam,
for a total distance of 75 miles. It is a special shock
proof x-ray machine rated at 300,000 volts.
Due to the circumferential and longitudinal welding
of these giant sections, from 8J/2 to 30 feet in diameter,
it is necessary to take 159,000 exposures and involving
the use of more than 24,000,000 square inches of film.
To meet this unusual problem x-ray apparatus of a new
type was necessary. A 300,000 volt rating was needed
to produce radio graphs through steel plates up to four
inches in thickness. It also had to meet certain space
limitations and be portable.
This new equipment developed by General Electric
provides electrical safety throughout the immersion of
the transformer, condensers, Kenotron tubes, and the
x-ray tube itself in oil within a sealed and grounded
tank. It is impossible for anyone to come in contact
with the high tension system while it is in operation,
a single low tension power supply being the only elec-
trical connection. The apparatus consists of three units
—a shock proof head, the operator's controls, and an

chanical carriage so designed that it can operate inside
or outside the penstock, travelling on a narrow gauge
track.
CIRCUIT BREAKER OPERATES WITH
MINIMUM MAINTENANCE
A new oil blast circuit breaker, which will withstand
10,000 open-close-open operations without maintenance
has recently been announced. The new breaker is par-
ticularly recommended for steel mill main roll drive
starting and jogging service or for severe-duty appli-
cations which require apparatus to withstand frequent
operation.
The ratings of the new breaker are: 15,000 volts at
either 600 or 1200 amperes; a one second short time
inrush rating of 60,000 amperes; a five second short
time inrush rating of 50,000 amperes; and an inter-
rupting rating of 100,000 kva.
Thorough tests have proved that the equipment will
perform 10,000 operating cycles of closing and opening
1200 amperes at 2300 volts or 1000 amps at 6600 volts
without any maintenance, contact reconditioning, or oil
change. The breaker is of single tank construction suit-
able for mounting on open or in enclosed frameworks.
MANHATTAN'S NEWEST LIGHTNING ROD
A modern lightning protection system has recently
been installed on the new 616-foot General Electric
building in New York City. Thus the structure becomes
in effect Manhattan's newest lightning rod, because the
system, in addition to guarding the building itself from
damage by lightning, provides a certain amount of
protection to nearby and lower structures. This fact
was discovered by high-voltage engineers of the com-
pany through investigations of both real and man-made
lightning. A low lightning rod is particularly effective
in this respect in proportion to its height. A rod 100
feet high will protect a flat area surrounding it for a
distance of approximately 400 feet from the base of
the rod, when the storm cloud is not lower than 1000
feet. A 500-foot rod will protect an area 650 feet in
radius. A 1000-foot rod will protect an area at least
1000 feet in radius. This is assuming a flat area. All
structures wholly within an imaginary cone, the apex
of which is the tip of the lightning rod and the base of
which is the protected area, receive the benefit of the
rod.
FIRE TOWER GIFT FROM UNIVERSITY
As a result of a donation from the University of
Michigan, a 150-foot fire tower is to be erected in the
Porter township oil field of Midland County. This
tower will be one of the tallest in the state and will be
a great protector against the menace of forest fires.
Porter township is largely made up of areas of brush
and cut-over land in which a grave fire hazard exists
during the dry months of the year. This fire menace
jeopardizes not only the private property of individuals,
but the operations of drillers as well.
The gift from the University was in the form of a
253-foot Insley steel builders tower, which was erected
at a cost of $3000 and weighs \7l/2 tons. While in
possession of the University, it was used in experi-
ments on wind structures.
When dismantled, a sufficient portion to erect a new
150-foot structure in Midland County will be set aside
and the remaining section raised at a site which will
be determined later.
SLIDE RULE DANCE
Plans for the annual Engineer's Dance are rapidly
being formulated and from all appearances this year's
shindig will even surpass those of previous years in
entertaining value. The affair will take place in the
Union Ball Room on March 23rd.
Merle Jacobs and his orchestra, popular Cleveland
music makers, have been secured to provide the rhythm
for the occasion. Jacobs' orchestra has been featured
on the program of the Hollenden Hotel in Cleveland
for over two years, this dance marking his first outside
appearance since he went there. As a featured soloist
the orchestra has Senorita Chita, a girl singer. The
orchestra has been broadcasting over the National
Broacasting System, and at present can be heard by
radio listeners over a well known Cleveland station.
in a dinner dance program.
Stanley Killian, '34E, Chairman of the dance, has
announced that following the popular trend, favors have
been discontinued and in their place novel programs
have been substituted. These programs are made up
as exact replicas of slide rules and have unique covers
of celluloid.
In continuing the example of last year's dance and
all major dances given on the campus this year, the
tickets were quickly sold out and a large attendance is
assured.
Other committeemen for the dance, helping to com-
plete plans, are the following senior engineers: Jack E.
Salmon, William H. Mohrhoff, Steinar Vaksdal, Ken-
neth G. Roe, Donald C. Anderson, D. Joy Burnett, J.
Stuart Smart, and Arthur H. Mosier.

In five places at once
—by telephone
Conference telephone service — a new telephone convenience —
enables a number of people far apart to talk together as freely as though
gathered around a table.
This fosters quicker interchange of ideas in business—saves time
and money—expedites decisions. For example: an executive wishes to
discuss plans with his district managers. His telephone is connected sim-
ultaneously with each of theirs—all can talk, all hear everything that is said!
Through constantly developing new uses, Bell System service grows
more and more valuable.

"Just studying Astronomy, officer."
After considerable research and careful study on a
problem of great import to student engineers, we offer
several suggestions which may be of value. For years
the most difficult task in the entire curriculum for engi-
neers has been the struggle to remain awake in Economic
lectures. (Or Che. 1, if you feel that way about it. Per-
sonally we rate "Ec" first, with M.E. 3 running a close
second.) Anyway, in any of these courses it's a tough
job to keep the eyelids apart and the chin off the chest.
We have felt for a long time that this problem in mod-
ern education merits attention and so we have bestirred
the editorial gray matter and evolved the following sug-
gestions for those who find it difficult to shun the arms
of Morpheus during arduous lectures.
1. Take your slide-rule to class. Hold it over the
edge of the desk. If you start to doze you'll drop it on
the floor. Result: The noise will wake you up and
you'll spend the rest of the hour cussing yourself for
breaking the glasses. (Note: This method is not so
effective if you have unbreakable glasses in your rule.)
If you've forgotten your slip-stick, substitute: (a) a
bottle of ink, (b) your watch, (c) your room-mate's
watch.
2. Take a pencil and paper. Make three rows of
three dots each, equally spaced. Try to connect these
dots with three straight-line segments without raising
your pencil from the paper. It can be done. (If you
get the answer, come around to the TECHNIC office and
show us. It's had us guessing for weeks.)
A poetically inclined person, unidentified and still
at large, is responsible for the following bit of didactic
doggerel:
All things come to him who waits,
But here's a rule for a slicker—
The man who goes for what he wants
Is sure to get it quicker.
STRESSES
AND
STRAINS
In a newspaper from a nearby city we ran across this
little article:
To speak with a pleasant voice you must give full
and correct value to the vowels. A theatrical producer
recently stated that of 300 girls interviewed, he found
only two that could say "no" properly.
Not a very high percentage, properly speaking.
The biology prof was speaking.
"I have here some very fine specimens of dissected
frogs which I will show you."
Unwrapping the parcel, some sandwiches, fruit, and
hard-boiled eggs came to view.
"But surely—I ate my lunch!" he exclaimed.
—Pen nsylvania Triangle.
"It's scandalous to charge us $10 for towing the car
only three or four miles," protested the motorist's wife.
"Never mind, dear," replied hubby, "he's earning
it; I've got my brakes on.''
—Earth Mover.
The somewhat pompous head of a large department
store was passing through the packing room one day
when he saw a boy lounging against a wood box, whist-
ling cheerfully. The chief stopped and looked at him.
"How much do you get a week?" he asked.
"Five dollars."
"Then here's a week's pay—get out."
When the toy had departed, the boss turned to one
of his subordinates.
"When did we hire that boy?" he demanded.
"We never hired him," came the astonishing reply.
"He just brought in a package from another firm."
Sunday School Teacher: "Who was the mother of
Moses?"
Little Mary: "Pharaoh's daughter.''
S. S. T.: "But she found him in the bullrushes."
L. M.: "That was her story."
—Earth Mover.

Triangles, junior engineering honorary society, met
for the first time this semester on Sunday evening, Feb-
ruary 18.
Following the recommendation of Dean Sadler, the
question of establishing a chapter here of Texnicoy,
now a local honorary society at Ohio State University,
was submitted to the society for its reaction. Attempts
are being made on the part of the Ohio group to enlarge
the scope of their organization to one of a national char-
acter. Since the Ohio society is similar to Triangles
and Yulcans, it was thought that perhaps a merger with
either one of the two local fraternities would obliterate
some of the difficulties of starting a new chapter. How-
ever, the members declined the offer, and also voiced an
unfavorable attitude towards the establishment of an-
other honorary society on this campus.
After the usual routine business, it was proposed
that Triangles should help collect class dues. It was
felt that such a gesture would be desirable, and accord-
ingly plans were made for its execution.
Unfortunately, because of unfavorable develop-
ments, the smoking room project will have to be aban-
doned, according to the committee investigating the
lxissibilities of inaugurating suitable smoking rooms in
the \Vest Engineering Building.
The meeting was presided over by Jack Bellamy, '35,
newly-elected president of the group.
MILITARY BALL
Though the Military Ball will not be held until
April 27, the dance committee is already picked and
work has begun on the assumption that more time will
make for a better planned dance. Frederick S. Kohl.
'34E. is general chairman. He also holds the highest
rank in the R.O.TTC. unit here, that of Colonel. Three
other seniors, John R. Odell, '34, Edward F. Jaros.
'34E and Stanley C. Killian, '34E are also on the com-
mittee. The Junior members are John Sager, '34E
and Truman Smith, '35. The Junior and Senior mem-
bers were picked by the regular Army officers in charge
of the R.O.T.C. here. Freshman and sophomore mem-
bers are Charles Framberg, '36E, Kenneth Mosier,
'36E, Robert Cousins, '37E and Henry Gilfillan. '37E.
Don Lyon, '34A is an ex-officio member.
Several innovations for this year's dance have al-
ready been suggested by the committee. One is the
elimination of the Grand March, substituting for it
some sort of Military formation. It is also probable
that the stereotyped decorations of the past few years
will be replaced with a new scheme. The orchestra has
not yet been selected nor has the ticket price been set,
but an announcement will be forthcoming in the next
few weeks.

Capt. A. B. Custis addresses the Student Branch
of the A.S.M.E. on "Organization and Management"
at the meeting on February 27. Mr. Basom of the
Drawing Department showed some official Army films
of battle scenes which belong to his collection.
President Kohl announced the dates of the Students'
Conference as April 23 and 24. The delegate from
Michigan has not been selected as yet.
Of additional interest was the announcement of the
Charles T. Main award for the best student paper on
"Air Conditioning—Its Practicability and Relation to
Public Welfare." The winner of the award is to re-
ceive a prize of $150.00 and an engraved certificate.
All student members are eligible to participate. The
contest closes June 30, 1934.
On Wednesday, March 14, a joint meeting with the
Detroit Section was held at the Union. Dr. Hirshfeld.
Chief of Research of the Detroit Edison Company,
spoke on "Recent Developments in the Engineering
Profession."
SIGMA RHO TAU
Twenty-seven men were formally initiated by the

F.E.R.A.
There were 188 students employed on part time F.E.
R.A. jobs during February and they earned a total
of $808.33, John Christensen, controller of the Uni-
versity, announced. These jobs ranged from clerical
and research workers to soda fountain and tea room
attendants. There are now 633 students qualified for
Federal Aid jobs, and over 500 of them have been put
to work.

Meeting the requirements of industry—
The Induction Furnace combines purity
of product with selective temperature control


on Paper
By Charles A. Duerr, '34E
New in the field of sound record-
ing is the recently developed process
by which human speech may be in-
scribed on paper. A device, not
revolutionary in its fundamental
principles but possessing many im-
portant advantages over those now
in common use, has been perfected
after six years of experiment by
Merle Duston, a Detroit inventor.
Unique only in that it works by
means of reflected rather than trans-
mitted light, this recording device is
much simpler and lends itself to
greater ease and convenience in
operation than other present day re-
cording machines. The process is
essentially the same as that used in
the "sound-track" method of talking
motion picture recording except that
the opaque paper reflects the light
beam upon the photo-electric cell whereas the sound-
track merely interrupts a direct beam from the light
souce to the tube.
The paper tape used resembles the common ticker
tape except that it is only one-half inch wide. It is
prepared by running it through a sensitizing solution
of iron salts and other chemicals commonly used in
photographic work. It is then wound on reels and
allowed to dry. When dry it has a slight yellow-green
tinge.
When the machine is operating this tape is unwound
from the reel and drawn between two electrodes, one
of which is a brass roller and the other a thin steel
spring. These two electrodes are connected to the out-
put terminals of a specially designed amplifier. The
sound waves are picked up by an ordinary microphone,
transformed into electrical impulses by the amplif&gt;er
and sent to the electrodes. When the tape has passed
through these contacts black lines have appeared. It
is not known, even by Mr. Duston himself, just what
change takes place causing these lines to appear
Whether heat, electric flux, or a combination of the
two, causes this phenomenon is still a matter for in-
vestigation to determine. It is interesting to note that
chemical examinations of the paper before and after
Mr. Merle Dustin pointing
out the recording electrode
of his sound reproducer

Details of the mechanism
showing all of the operating
elements
it passes the electrodes yield very different analyses.
The larger part of the machine is devoted to the
reproducing process. A light source throws a beam
through a narrow slot where it is reflected by the paper
to the photo-electric cell. The impulses of the cell are
transmitted to an ordinary radio circut and loud speak-
er.
Many and varied are the uses to which this recorder
may be put. One of the first, believes Mr. Duston,
will be as an adjunct to the radio equipment on govern-
ment and Navy ships. Fast incoming messages may
be recorded and then reproduced at a slower sl&gt;eed for
translation. This device also provides a simple means
of sending "hashed up" or "inverted" messages. The
desired communication may be recorded, the tape run
through the machine backwards, and the resulting
sound broadcast. The received message may be re-
corded, the tape reversed, and the communication be-
comes intelligible. To stations unequipped with a
recording apparatus these messages would be of no
value if intercepted.
Where permanent records of spoken words are de-
sired they may be made by this method. Radio stations
may keep records of all announcements, lectures, and
the like which they broadcast in order to avoid libel or

ment are in question. Testimony offered in court may
be set down in permanent form and confessions, verbal
contracts, conversations, and other oral statements may
be reproduced as evidence. In police work this device
may become valuable for recording telephone con-
versations and incriminating statements gathered by
hidden microphones. Brokerage offices may find that
the recorder facilitates the handling of telephone orders.
It is conceivable that, in the near future, correspond-
ence may be recorded in this manner, and even that
books and newspapers may be distributed in the form
of reels of paper tape. The process is very cheap—
fifteen cents worth of paper being sufficient to record
an hour's conversation.
As yet Mr. Duston does not promise that his inven-
tion will compete with the established recording devices
in the realm of music. However, it is possible that,
when a more suitable grade of paper is available for
this purpose and when further perfections have been
made thus eliminating the troublesome background
noise which mars the present performance, the paper
tape may become a rival of the phonograph disc in
musical recording.
The Malleabilization of
White Cast Iron
By Richard Schneidewind
Research Engineer, Dept. of Eng. Research
Malleable iron is an important member in the group
of ferrous metallurgical products. It is widely used in
agricultural implements, automobiles, engine parts,
hardware and building equipment, pipe fittings, and for
many parts in railroad equipment. According to figures
of the Department of Commerce there are about 150
plants in the United States engaged in the manufacture
of malleable iron with an annual capacity of 1,350,000
tons. The average selling price of malleable castings
is $75 per ton, so that in normal times the value of
malleable iron produced per year is about $100,000,000.
The usual procedure followed in the manufacture
of malleable iron castings involves three processes:
1. Melting. A charge of pig iron and scrap with
sometimes small additions of steel is melted down in a
cupola or in an air furnace. Sometimes the metal is
poured directly from the cupola, forming a hard, brittle
white iron which is subsequently malleableized, but
usually cupola iron is refined and superheated in an air
furnace or electric furnace. Cupola iron possesses
properties inferior to airfurnace or duplexed iron.
2. Casting. The molten iron is transferred by ladles
into sand molds. Only a small amount of metal-mold
iron is made at present.
3. Annealing. After the sprues and fins have been
removed, the castings are cleaned by tumbling or sand
blasting. They are then placed in annealing pots and
annealed to form soft, malleable, machinable castings.
The annealing furnaces may be heated with oil,
powdered coal, gas, or electricity. The first two fuels
are at present most generally used because of their
lower cost.
The time required for annealing malleable iron varies
from five to seven days. On the l&gt;asis of $75 per ton
for the finished product, the cost of annealing repre-
sents about $15; in other words, the annual annealing
cost in the United States in normal times is about
$18,750,000. The long annealing cycle makes anneal-
ing an important consideration, not only because of the
high fuel cost, but also because of the delay in produc-
tion and the cost of adequate equipment. Comparative-
ly little work was done on shortening the time of
malleableizing until after 1920. Since that time many
articles and patents have appeared which claim to de-
crease the time of annealing by various means. Many
of these methods involve changing the composition of
the malleable iron and some few of them are being
used in commercial applications. Other methods claim
to effect a saving in time principally by maintaining
certain significant annealing temperatures and care-
fully controlling the cooling rates. The trend is toward
higher annealing temperatures. Well designed furnaces
and accurate control methods are, therefore, of great-
est importance.
The work conducted at the University of Michigan
on the subject of malleable iron was done under the
sponsorship of the American Gas Association. The
various factors influencing the rate of malleableizing
were systematically investigated. It was found that
the principle of these are the silicon content, the total
carbon content, impurities such as sulphur and phos-
phorus, the temperatures of heating and the tempera-
ture to which the molten iron had been heated before
pouring.
Normal malleable iron has a tensile strength of about
54,000 pounds per square inch, a yield point of 36,000
pounds per square inch and an elongation of 15 per
cent. As was pointed out before, such an iron requires
from 5 to 7 days of annealing. By increasing the
silicon, reducing the carbon and superheating the melt,
it was possible to obtain an iron which annealed com-
pletely in less than ten hours. The tensile strength of
this material proved to be over 60,000 pounds per
square inch with a yield point around 45,000 pounds
per square inch and an elongation of 15 to 18 per cent.
It has been the usual practice to pack the white iron in
inert material to prevent scaling. By maintaining a
proper atmosphere, it has been found possible at the
University to anneal without the use of inert packing
material, thus obviating the necessity for heating large
quantities of non-productive load and shortening the
time for coming to heat.

Proposed Telescope
An Interview with Dr. R. M. Petrie
Poured at the Corning Glass Works, of Corning,
New York, recently was the 4 ton disk which is to
become the reflecting mirror of the new telescope pro-
posed for the University of Michigan. The finished
mirror will have a diameter of 84 inches and, if com-
pleted before the 200 inch reflector planned for the
California Institute of Technology, will be the second
largest instrument of this type in the world. The 100
inch reflecting telescope in use at the Mount Wilson
observatory is at present the largest.
Ladled out in 300 pound amounts at intervals of
about 45 minutes, the 4 tons of molten glass was cast
in a mold which was placed in a thermostatically con-
trolled furnace that allows the glass to solidify at a
rate sufficiently reduced so that undesirable cooling
stresses are avoided. Cooling at first will proceed at
the rate of alx&gt;ut 1 ° every 24 hours and several months
must elapse before the grinding operations will begin.
The mirror was cast in the form of a short cylinder
and the reflecting surface will be accurately ground to
a true paraboloid. The glass is of a newly developed
type of Pyrex with a very low coefficient of expansion,
an important feature in these instruments which must
be subjected to changing temperatures without change
in the shape of the accurately ground reflecting surface.
The focal length of the primary mirror will be about
40 feet and that of the combination of primary and
secondary mirrors about 130 feet. Arrangements will
be made for direct photography at the focal point of
the primary, thus eliminating the usual secondary re-
flection and the attendant loss of light. Spectroscopic
work will be done at the lower end of the tube with
the regular Cassegrainian mounting in which the sec-
ondary mirror reflects the rays directly back through
an opening in the center of the primary. The telescope
can also be fitted with an interferometer for measure-
ments of stellar diameters and the study of double
stars. . ., t&gt;
Novel also will be the mounting, the principle of
which might be termed modified split polar axis
suspension. With this arrangement it will be possible
to point the telescope to any point of the sky—a feature
which the present Mount Wilson reflector lacks be-
cause of the inaccessible region near the north celestial
pole.
The 100 tons of moving parts will be driven by me-
chanisms powered by synchronous motors operating on
controlled frequency and modelled after those perfected
at the McMath-Hulbert observatory. For each of the
three coordinate axes there will be. a high, intermediate,
and low speed to facilitate settings. A special motor-
driven guiding chair, designed by Dr. Heber Curtis,
Director of the Observatory at the University of Mich-
igan, will enable the observer to locate himself at any
desired point within the dome.
The mirror will be coated with aluminum instead
of silver as have been the older types. A newly-dis-
covered method of coating by evaporation of aluminum
under very low pressure and condensation upon the
mirror permits the use of the more desirable and more
durable aluminum reflecting surface.
The new telescope will be about 5 times as power-
ful as the University's present 37.5 inch reflector and
will permit the study of objects too faint to be ef-
fectively observed in the smaller telescope.
The proposed location of the new observatory is a
slight elevation near the shore of Base Lake, about 15
miles northwest of Ann Arbor, where the smoke and
traffic vibration which are at times troublesome at the
present observatory will be eliminated.

A Practical Example
In the past few years, the use of oxy-acetyline shape
cutting process for the fabrication of steel parts has
been rapidly increasing. With the perfection of pre-
cision machines for holding and guiding the torch the
quality of the work which can be done has increased
considerably.
Formerly, the oxygen cutting process was more used
for destruction than construction, fmding many ap-
plications in salvage work. The new machines give a
degree of accuracy almost unbelievable, and leave very
little machining to be done. For large heavy jobs they
save a great amount of time and labor.
The process consists essentially of heating the part
to be cut to a red heat with an oxy-acetylene flame and
then applying a stream of pure oxygen which eats away
the metal by oxidation. This process, which is more
than ten years old, seems to be coming into its own.
In connection with the recent submarine salvage opera-
tion, a cutting torch has I&gt;ecn perfected to cut under-
water.
As an illustration of the type of work done, a job re-
cently carried out by a large steel company may be
cited. This plant received an order for blanks for two
rotors, each to be 12 in. in thickness and 4 ft. 8^4 in
in diameter. Each rotor was designed to be made in
two halves, so that there were four blanks to be cut,
all of them of the same size and shape. In addition to
the peripheral cutting, there were three triangular open-
ings to be cut in each blank.
In the plate mill shipping building, the steel for the
rotors was ready. There were two 12-in. slabs, one

The finishing cut on rim
about 7x7y2 ft. weighing about 26.400 lbs., the other
about 7x8 ft. weighing about 28.200 lbs.
It was first decided that therse two slabs be cut in
half in order to get them into workable size. The shape
cutting machine was adjusted for a cutting speed of 3
in. per minute and the oxygen pressure was adjusted to
about 130 lbs. per square inch. It can readily be seen
that it took but 28 to 30 minutes to complete this cut.
The second slab was then placed in position and severed
in a similar fashion.
The kerf for these cuts was measured and found to
be J4 inch. This figure was given to the templet mak-
er so that he could make due allowance for this in
making his templet.
While the templet maker was at work, the first
slab was set in position for starting the work. In order
to make starting places for the cuts for the holes be-
tween the spokes, a ^ inch oxygen lance was rigged
up and three holes lanced through what would be the
centers of these openings. Pre-heating of the point
directly in line with the lance head was done with a
cutting blowpipe. The time for lancing each hole was
about 22 seconds and the holes obtained were straight
and very little larger than the outside diameter of the
lance pipe.
The following day work was continued. A few trial
cuts were made at the edge of the slab in order to
decide on the exact speed and oxygen pressure to obtain
the best possible cut. A speed of 3j4 inch per minute,
and an oxygen pressure of about 110 lbs. per square
inch were found best. The three holes between the
spokes were the first cuts to be made, leaving the out-
side of the rotor to be finished last.
When the piece was completed it was checked against
the working drawing and the faces of the outside cuts
as well as those between the spokes were found to be
perfcctly square with the top and bottom face of the
rotor. The following morning holes were lanced in the
three other slabs in preparation for the spoke cuts and
the three other blanks finished.
An idea of the total amount of labor and time spent
on this can be gained from the following: laying out
the templet on the slab to locate holes for lancing and
marks to facilitate setting of the templet on the table in
relation to the slab which rested on the machine work
supports, and the time for lancing the holes was alto-
gether about 1 hour labor for each of two men ; leveling
and setting of the one piece on the supports, checking
and adjusting the machine speed, checking the oxygen

other hour's time for two men. The actual labor time
during the cutting which includes the removal of all
cut parts and the removal from the machine of the
one completed piece amounted to about 4 hours labor
for two men. The total for this amounted to 12 man
hours for each section of a rotor.

Oxy-Aeetylnu Tips
Half of one rotor completed
This type job shows that large economies can be ef-
fected by the use of this process; that a great deal of
preliminary work which formerly would have been
necessary for preparing parts of this nature by other
methods has been done away with; and that a job of
this kind, which may be an unusual non-production job
for some plants, can be handled in a relatively short
length of time with ease and accuracy.
SLIDE RULE DANCE
March twenty-third was "Big Date Xight" for over
three hundred Michigan Engineers, for it was on that
night the annual engineer's party, The Slide Rule
Dance, "came off" at the Union. As has been the case
in the past, those attending were practically unanimous
in declaring that they had an enjoyable time. Merle
Jacobs and his Hotel Hollenden Orchestra turned out
some real music and made a hit with everyone.
Don Anderson and his decoration committee pro-
duced what was characterized by no less an authority
than Dean Rea, as "The best decorations I've ever seen
in the Union". The decorations committee put in some
hard work and the results spoke for themselves. This
year the decorations departed from the strict engineer-
ing motif and instead, incorporated with the inherent
beauty of the Union Ballroom, lent themselves to a
carnival air. Large stalactic forms, vividly colored,
were suspended from the ceiling at eight points, op-
posite the side wall lighting units. The main design
forms were tied in with the lighting by means of long
streamers which fastened to white reflectors immediate-
ly in back of the pilaster lights. Engineering tradition
MILITARY BALL
With Don Redman and his Internationally Famous
Dance Orchestra signed to furnish the music for the
Military Ball, it seems that a roaring good time is in
store for those who answer "Here" when roll is called
at the Union on the night of April 27. Redman was
obtained only after considerable difficulty, according to
Frederick Kohl, general chairman, and brings with him
an aggregation which has won wide renown on the
CBS chain and on Brunswick records. Redman has
featured the "Chipso" program, together with the Mills
Brothers for months. He comes directly from the
Casino de Paree in New York City where he scored
a sensational hit. Don is also a song writer of note,
one of his most popular compositions being "How'm
I Doin' ".
With Redman to furnish "color" to what is already
the most colorful dance on the campus, it looks as if
the evening will be one to be long remembered. With
the Union Ballroom decorated in the national colors
and service uniforms galore to be seen on every side,
this dance can justly lay claim to its colorful title. A
feature of the occasion will be the presentation of the
new initiates of Scabbard and Blade and Pi Tau Pi
Sigma. Favors will be something new on this campus,
novelty bracelets, which should make a big hit with
the ladies.
Tickets are priced at $3.00 and the sale will l&gt;e
limited to two hundred and seventy. They may be
procured at the Union, R.O.T.C. Headquarters, Bal-
fours and from members of the committee. Besides
Kohl, the committee is made up of John Odell, '34;
Edward Jaros, '35E; Stanley Killian. '34E; John Sager,
'34E; Truman Smith. '35; Don Lyons, '34A; Charles
Framberg, '36E; Kenneth Mosier, '36E; Robert Cous-
ins, '37E and Henry Gilfillan, '37E.
was not slighted, however, for a replica of Michigan's
famous Engineering Arch, almost full size, immediately
in back of the orchestra, held the center of interest.
The giant eight foot slide rule, a Slide Rule Dance
tradition, was hung inside the arch.
The programs also made a hit, if the oft repeated,
"Oh, how cute", from the ladies can be taken as a
criterion.
The ticket sale was closed to engineering students
and the three hundred tickets were sold out exactly one
week after they were placed on sale and almost two
weeks before the dance. The low price on dance tickets
seems to be a real magnet and it is gratifying to see
that a really good time can be bought at a dance for
only two dollars. It is to bt hoped that the dances of
the future will be kept on "Everyman's" plane.

The New Portable Light Intensity Meter for Measuring Illumination
PORTABLE LIGHT INTENSITY METER DESIGNED
A small portable instrument for measuring light in-
tensity at any point has recently been announced by
Westinghouse. The "Right Light" meter makes ac-
curate checks on illumination, a simple operation, as the
instrument is calibrated directly in foot candles and is
small enough to carry in a pocket. Developed especi-
ally for use in homes to avoid eye strains due to faulty
illumination, it has already been used profitably in in-
creasing lighting efficiency in stores, factories, and
shops.
The new foot-candle meter embodies many unusual
features. It uses the Westinghouse Fhotox cell, a re-
cently developed photo-voltaic cell made of copper
oxide on a copper disk which generates an electric
current when subjected to light. The cell and the
microammeter which measures the cell current are
mounted together in a moulded case. The cell is
hinged, protecting it against breakage and protecting
the dial when the instrument is not in use. This also
allows light readings to be taken along the horizontal
without danger of shading by the observer.
The instrument is rigidly constructed with a scale
length of 1.8 inches and is divided into 50 divisions.
The scale is calibrated in foot candles and is also divid-
ed into sections indicating the minimum amount of
light considered satisfactory for various kinds of work
and conditions.
MEASURING HIGH FLUE GAS TEMPERATURES
The laboratory of the American Gas Association has
recently completed the measurement of flue gas
temperatures above the range of any known ther-
mocouples by applying the "spectral-line-reversal
method".
Professional
Notes . . . .
Small quantities of finely divided sodium salts are
introduced into the air-gas mixture prior to combustion
with the result that incandescent sodium vapor is pres-
ent in the flue gases from the furnace. The mono-
chromatic sodium light from this source and the light
from a calibrated band lamp are viewed through a
spectroscope.
The energy input to the calibrated band lamp is ad-
justed until the sodium spectral lines, as seen through
the spectroscope, appear to be reversing or just turn-
ing from light to dark on the continuous spectrum
background. A measure of the temperature of the
sodium vapor in the flue gases may be secured at this
point by noting the temperature of the band lamp fila-
ment with an optical pyrometer.
This method of high temperature measurement has
been checked in limited ranges with other methods in-
volving pyrometers, thermocouples, and heat balance
methods, and indications are that its accuracy is very
great, although it has not yet been checked over wide
temperature ranges.
RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN "HEAVY WATER"
Under the direction of Professors Anderson, Bates,
and Hal ford, the Chemistry Department of the Univer-
sity has been doing considerable work with deuterium
oxide, otherwise known as "heavy water". Dr. E. W.
Washburn of the Bureau of Standards in Washington
first separated deuterium oxide from ordinary water
last year by electrolysis of ordinary water. But the
University chemists have been working on a process
which will be continuous and will not require human
supervision, thus making the process cheaper, since it
takes a long time to produce pure deuterium oxide.
Heavy water is made from the heavy atoms of
hydrogen, deuterium, and oxygen. Dr. Washburn dis-
covered that deuterium has a different rate of electro-
lysis from that of common hydrogen, and that by
electrolysing all but two percent of a quantity of water
the remainder was about 160 parts in a million heavier
than ordinary water. By recombining all the hydrogen
and oxygen given off in this process it was found that
the water formed was 20 parts in a million lighter than

proved to be entirely independent of the electrodes,
electrolyte, and current density employed. This was
the first time that water had been fractinated, and was
done by using the 11 meter column still at the Bureau
of Standards. A liter of water was distilled in a week.
At this rate it would take a year to obtain a liter of
dilute deuterium oxide.
To check this phenomenon, water was taken from
an electrolytic cell which had been in continuous opera-
tion without draining the water for five years. The
water was found to have higher than usual density.
\Vater from the Dead Sea, where evaporation is the
only way water is removed, also showed a higher
density, as did the water of crystalization of certain
salts known to have been formed by the evaporation
of large bodies of water.
Characteristics of deuterium oxide are as follows:
density of 1.1, freezing point of 3.8 deg. C., boiling
point of 101 to 104 deg. C., maximum density at 11.6
deg. C., vapor pressure of 10% lower than water, re-
fractive index D line at 20 deg. C. of 1.328 as com-
pared with 1.333 for water, viscosity of 14.2 against
10.9 for water, surface tension of 67.8.
The Michigan process of repeating the electrolysis
time after time automatically was described before the
American Chemical Society in St. Petersburg, Florida
the first of April, and promises to expedite investiga-
tion of this new development in chemistry.
NEW SINGLE-PHASE WATERWHEEL GENERATOR
The largest single-phase waterwheel generator ever
built in this country, rated at 35,000 kv-a., is to be
constructed for use in connection with the electrifica-
tion of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It was recently
announced that work on the electrification of the line
was nearing completion and, the hydroelectric gener-
ators, together with necessary transformers are to be
ready for operation late this fall.
The locomotive motors require 25-cycle single-phase
power. Usually the power is generated by three-phase.
60-cycle generators and changed to 25-cycle single-
phase current by frequency converters. In this case,
the new generator will be designed to produce the re-
quired type of power, thus saving conversion losses,
which average more than five per cent. The generator
will operate at 100 rpm.
For use in the transmission of power from the gen-
erator to the Pennsylvania Railroad's own high-tension
lines at Perryville. Aid., there will be four 20,000 kv-a.
single-phase transformers. The transformers, weigh-
ing about 160 tons each, will raise the voltage from
13,000, the generator voltage, to 132,000 for transmis-
sion. The contract for both the generator and the
transformers has been given to General Electric.
STATIC TESTS OF TRANSPORT PLANE
The Materials Division of the Army Air Corps at
Wright Field has recently completed the first static
tests made on a modern high-speed transport plane.
The plane, a Boeing 247, was taken from regular ser-
vice on United Air Lines after 1,408 hours in the air.
and was given a thorough flight test by Army flyers
before it was tested.
The plane was suspended by specially constructed
supports and the fuselage was loaded with shot and
lead dust until it buckled. The required load factor for
the rear section was 5.25, but it did not fail until the
load factor was 8.75. For the forward section the
required factor was 5.50 and it failed at 8.50.
Total weight to break the fuselage was 52 tons, al-
though safety requirements called for a 30 ton
strength. A load 60 percent over the maximum per-
missible load was carried without any sign of failure.

excess of these required by the Department of Com-
merce. There were no signs of metal fatigue or duo-
vibrations of similar frequency which could set up
dangerous harmonics.
The wings withstood a load of 36 tons—well above
any load which might be applied in flight. The landing
gear with stood an impact of 32 tons without damage.
This would be equal to the impact of a free drop from
a considerable height.
RADIO EQUIPMENT FOR NEW HAVEN RAILROAD
With the cooperation of the Xew Haven Railroad
Company, an experimental 5 meter radiophone system
has been installed on one of the road's regularly
operating freight trains. Complete two way radio-
phone equipment is installed on both engine and caboose
of the train permitting the engineer and brakeman to
communicate at all times without difficulty.
The equipment consists of an ultra-high frequency
transmitter and receiver with microphone and loud
speaker located in the engine cab and duplicate equip-
ment located in the caboose. Separate antennae are
used for transmitting and receiving. The two an-
tennae used on the engine equipment are located on
the front end of the engine and are connected to the
transmitter and receiver located in the cab of the en-
gine by means of two-conductor transmission lines.
The antennae for the rear end of the train are located
on the two sides of the caboose. The equipment
operates from a 6 volt storage battery supply and is
capable of about 30 hours operation without recharg-

TAU BETA PI HONORS NEW MEN
On Tuesday, March 27. Tau Beta Pi initiated twenty
new men, taking sixteen from the junior class and four
from the senior class.
At the banquet which followed. Professor A. I).
Moore, traditional toastmaster, presided. Ronald H.
Culver, '34E, gave the welcoming address and was fol-
lowed immediately by Erie Sommer,'35E. who respond-
ed on behalf of the initiates. Dean II. C. Sadler also
welcomed the new men and mentioned the recent
changes in the engineering curricula to bring in more
of the "broadening subjects''.
Professor Max Handman of the Economics depart-
partment gave a very good and interesting talk, dis-
cussing the relation of economics to the engineer. He
gave the engineer credit for not entering the field just
to make money, saying that there was more than that
desire behind his interest. Because of the value of the
engineers' contribution to society, Prof. Handman sug-
gested that instead of allowing the capitalist to exploit
the ideas and inventions of the engineer, some organiza-
tion should be set up so that society would benefit
directly.
The seniors initiated were: A. II. Easton, II. 1).
Ritter. R. E. Blackwell. and H. J. VanWelde. The
juniors included: J. F. Schmidt, A. A. Conviser, L. V.
Colwell, O. A. Knuusi. M. A. Mortenson, W. H. Budd.
J. C. Moore. P. A. Singleton, Eric Sommer, R. M.

Locomotive Equipped With the Recent Radio System
TRANSPORTATION CLUB
Prof. Edward A. Stalker of the Aeronautical Engi-
neering Department slxike before the Transportation
Club on Wednesday evening, March 28. in the Natural
Science Auditorium on "The Airmail and the Airlines'".
Professor Stalker indicated that the increase in the
number of airplanes in the future would affect society
such as the decentralization of large cities and increas-
ing international complications.
Comparing airlines as mail carriers with other means
now in use, he stated that a subsidy was necessary for
the security of the private airline and the efficiency of
the airmal system. He went on to say that the reason
the army seems to have failed was not necessarily be-
cause of incompetency but because of over-enthusiasm
on the part of the aviators and lack of adequate experi-
ence in understanding the highly efficient airway
system.

A TRIBUTE
As we, the new staff of the Technic. begin where
our predecessors left off, our work is cut out for us.
To keep the quality of the magazine at the high level
which they set will require all our effort.
Killian, Vaksdal, Mohrhoff—three names to be re-
membered in the history of the Technic—they have left
a mark for us to shoot at, a record of which to be
proud. Even in these trying times, each issue has paid
for itself, and the quality of the articles has been main-
tained. The magazine you are reading is the result of
their effort—need we say more?
To say that it was a pleasure to work with them is
putting it mildly. Their force and vitality permeated
the entire staff, resulting in the production of the best
volume of the Technic in recent years. If we can pro-
duce a magazine to approach it, we will be doing well.
The watchword is ....
Cooperation
Cooperation it will take to produce another fine job.
This we are sure to receive from everyone whose name
appears in the new staff. However, cooperation should
extend farther than that. This is the magazine of
every student of the College of Engineering, and as
such, the staff will appreciate suggestions, advice and
criticism in order to produce what the students desire.
The Technic wants in every way possible to be of ....
Service
Speaking of service, partaking in extra-curricular
activities is one form of service open to every under-
graduate. We are pleased to note that engineers are
busy with outside activities. Their talents find many
uses alxmt the campus. The success of the last J-Hop
was due in no small measure to the efforts of Philip
Singleton, '35E. Even the Michigan Daily recognized
that! In the recent Junior Girls' Play, Joseph Schantz
and Francis Ileadley, Electrical grads, took care of the
radio system very efficiently. The "Gondoliers" includ-
ed a number of engineers. Moreover, the cast for the
revived Union opera contains the following: Lowell
Sanies, '34E, Arthur Schoen, '34E and Austin Webb,
'34E. Here's hoping they come off ....
With Banners Flying
That's the name of the opera, revived after a lapse
of years. The opera has been in rehearsal since Feb-
ruary, and will be presented at the Whitney Theatre,
traditional playhouse for this event. Every engineer
should support the undertaking to insure its success
and to bring back some of that old spirit of which we
hear. Would it not be better to enter something of
this nature rather than to live entirely in terms of text-
books and studies? After all our future does depend
quite materially on ....
Friendliness
Much as we regret it, the lack of friendliness is quite
evident. Day after day, semester after semester, we
pass our classmates without as much as a friendly nod.
Perhaps it seems unnecessary, but every little act tends
to create a feeling of comfort. More than that, it
eliminates that feeling of strangeness ever present in a
large institution. For instance—each junior class finds
on its roster many newcomers from other institutions,
newcomers recognizing the prestige of this college.
Our attitude toward these new men will either strength-
en or weaken this opinion. What we do depends on
our spirit towards the school, which brings up the
subject of ....
School Spirit
Class spirit has noticeably been dying in the last few
years. It may be that the student has become more
conscientious. For that we are well pleased. But even
that is not sufficient reason for the decline of spirit.
For, essentially spirit is nothing more or less than an
admiration and a stirring feeling of devotion towards
the college. Something should be done. We feel that
the wearing of freshmen pots and junior jackets is
essential in keeping alive this feeling of unity. The
class of '36 is now discussing jackets, and we urge
every member to support those in charge. Speaking of
classes brings up that obnoxious subject ....
Class Dues
In order to continue this spirit after graduation, each
class appoints a permanent Alumni secretary whose
duty is to keep in contact with every member of the
class. The success of reunions depends on the secre-
tary, who cannot work without funds—which necessi-
tates class dues. If you want to see your classmates
in the future, provide for this. Pay your dues!
The Engineering Council has drawn up a perman-
ent record to be kept by the class treasurer to eliminate
the trouble experienced in the past.

Those who frequented the Union last year will
doubtless recall the beaming countenance of the
student desk clerk, William D. Allison. He has re-
cently accepted a position with the Hudson Motor
Car Company in Detroit.
TOASTMASTER' CLUB
Harold P. Hesler, '33E, Fredrick S. Kohl, '34E,
and Eric E. Sommer, '35 E were among those honored
at the revival of the Toastmasters Club, the second
oldest honor society on the campus.
Toastmasters, founded in 1897, became non-existent
in 1921. Through the help of interested members of
the Alumni Association, the journalism school, the
philosophy department and the speech department,
Toastmasters, the club that seeks out the men of ready-
wit and ability as after-dinner speakers, is again com-
ing into its own.
REGARDING THE FRONTISPIECE
Induction furnaces are today used in many pro-
cesses where it is found that they have definite advan-
tages over any other type of furnace.
Like the electric arc furnace, the melt from an in-
duction furnace is free from contamination by products
of combustion of fuels. No possibility of carbon pick-
up makes it even better than the arc furnace for some
purposes, such as low carbon stainless irons and mag-
netic alloys. Electromagnetic stirring of the molten
bath results in homogeneous melts, with no possible
segregation after alloys have once been added. In ad-
dition, the induction furnace temperature can be varied
with considerable more ease and rapidity than most
types of furnaces.
ANNUAL SPRING HOMECOMING
The Fourth Annual Spring Home Coming will be
held on May 11, 12, and 13. Although this event is
but four years old it has already become a tradition on
the Michigan Campus. Founded on the belief that
parents, alumni and friends would like to see the Uni-
versity under normal running conditions which are not
available during Fall Homecoming, Spring Homecom-
ing does accomplish its aim.
This year, as before, a long series of events has been
planned in order that all visitors might be able to see
things they are specifically interested in. However we
are emphasizing the fact that one should come here to
see a large University under nearly normal running
conditions. This weekend is to be rather a "culmina-
tion" weekend in that all scholastic and campus events
are to be in final review at the time.
Of specific interest to our visitors this will be the
Engineering Open House. Although every department
will be open and conducting experiments, classes, which
visitors are quite welcome to attend, will continue as
as usual. This year the wind tunnel, Navel tank, and
short wave radio station will likewise be open with
models on display and in process of experiment.
In all, this will be an excellent opportunity for all
those interested in Michigan to "get back home" as
they have planned to do for so long.
PHI LAMBDA UPSILON SCHOLARSHIPS
Phi Lambda Upsilon, honorary chemical fraternity,
has chosen Russell W. Houvener, '35E, as one of those
to receive its annual scholarships.
These scholarships consist of memberships in the
American Chemical Society, going to the student major-
ing in chemical engineering in the Engineering Col-
lege and the student majoring in chemistry in the Liter-
ary School who has the highest scholastic average in
his respective school.

NEW POWER FOR THE ARK
Here we present to our readers an authentic pictorial
record of the first known application of mechanical
principles to the propulsion of water craft. A sales-
man is enthusiastically pointing out the features of a
one goat-power drive. Noah doesn't seem to be parti-
cularly impressed, however. In fact he's holding his
nose. (It's a warm day and a goat's a goat even under
the best of conditions, so you can't blame him.) Shem
is doing a little mental arithmetic—he's trying to figure
out the carrot consumption and the results don't seem
to please him. Ham is giving the salesman the once-
over and wondering just how much he can beat down
the price. Japheth, the other junior partner in the
Noah Navigation Co., has gone to answer the telephone
or to see a man about a dog or—well, let's not be too
inquisitive, a man's got to have a little privacy some-
times.
A professor was lecturing on the rhinoceros. Seeing
that some of the class were allowing their minds to
wander, he said:
''I must beg you to give me your undivided attention.
It is absolutely impossible for you to form a true idea
of this hideous animal unless you keep your eyes fixed
on me.''

AUTHENTIC ACCOUNT OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF
A SLIDE RULE DANCE COMMITTEE MEETING
Chairman Killian calls the meeting to order by bang-
ing on the table with Vaksdal's slide-rule.
Mohrhoff reads the minutes of the preceding meet-
ing, managing to work in the one about the newly-
married couple and an old one about Mae West and
the corner grocer. A motion is made and seconded
to accept the first mentioned but to reject the second
because of its antiquity. Burnett offers to replace it
with a more modern version. After a hearing and
considerable discussion during which a number of out-
standing points were explained for the Ijenefit of
Anderson, who didn't get them the first time, it is de-
cided to substitute the Burnett version. It is suggested
that the motion be amended to include the acceptance
of the minutes. The motion is passed over the protest
of Roe who claims to have heard both jokes during
Christmas vacation.
Smart gives a report of the ticket sales. Of the 300
tickets printed, 290 are reported sold and 186 promised.
Money on hand from ticket returns amounts to the
grand total of $3.59. Smart suggests that returns will
undoubtedly be greater after the first of the month
when everybody's checks come in. Chairman Killian
remarks that there seems to be slight irregularities in
the figures and appoints Vaksdal and Sloane to check
up on Smart. Killian also appoints Salmon and Mosier

to check up on Vaksdal and Sloane; says that he, him-
self, will check up on Salmon and Mosier.
Salmon reports on publicity activities; proposes to
run a story in the "Daily" announcing the orchestra,
the choice of favors, the patrons and patronesses, and
the decorative scheme. It is suggested that the names
of the committee be included in the "Daily" story. The
suggestion is unanimously supported. It is suggested
that the choice of favors be kept secret until the night
of the dance. It is also proposed that the decorative
scheme be kept secret. It is pointed out that a list of
the patrons and patronesses is not available since the
invitations have not yet come back from the printers.
In view of the ticket sales it is conceded that additional
publicity regarding the orchestra would be superfluous.
The only remaining item is the names of the commit-
tee members. It is moved that the story be run any-
way and that Salmon do what he can to get front page
space. The motion is supported and unanimously
carried.
Anderson asks the indulgence of the chair to question
L',urnett about a point in the Mae West joke that
doesn't seem to be clear. Killian says he'll explain it
himself and fergawdsake please get it through his head
this time. Killian undertakes a lengthy explanation
with the aid of gestures and diagrams. Anderson still
doesn't grasp the idea. Smart, Vaksdal, and Sloane
join the discussion. Salmon says never mind, he's
heard a better one. it seems there were two Irishmen
* * * . Mohrhoff says that reminds him of the time
he had to drive stakes for a surveying party when they
went through a cow pasture. Burnett asks has anyone
heard the one about the man at the World's Fair who
couldn't get his quarter changed in time. Roe, Killian.
Vaksdal, Smart, Sloane, and Mosier are reminded
simultaneously of the one about the traveling salesman.
Anderson, after Killian's explanation, finally grins
sheepishly, blushes, and admits that it's all very clear
to him now—he just hadn't thought of it that way.
The meeting is finally adjourned when the janitor
locks up for the night.
A TREATISE ON THE PROFUNDITIES OF
LOVE AND SEX
Much has already been said about love and sex. It
has been discussed this way and that in its psychological,
physical, and historical aspects. There is. however,
another phase, relatively unexplored. All things in
this universe obey the fundamental laws of physics, so
let's try to apply them to love and see what hapl&gt;ens:
In considering love, we will deal with two bodies.
The one commonly called female is negative. This is
evidenced by its habitually saying no (even when mean-
ing yes) by shaking the head and by other forms of
negation. The one known as male is positive due to
Page Sixteen
April, 1934
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


assertions. These bodies each bear a charge, varying
with the individual, often known as sex appeal.
It is an experimental fact that F=K
Q-q
where F
is the attractive force, Q the charge on the male, q the
charge on the female, d the distance between them,
and k the medium coefficient. This coefficient varies,
l&gt;eing large when the medium is a dark living room and
small when it is an exam room. In late spring the
value of k for a moonlit park becomes relatively
enormous. As the distance between the bodies (d)
approaches zero, the attraction (F) approaches infinity.
This is especially true when both Q and q are large.
For instance, on a movie screen, when the distance (d)
is very small between such bodies as Jean Harlow,
possessing a large amount of q, and Clark Gable, with
an equal amount of Q, F becomes great. In this case,
when k is a bedroom, F I&gt;ecomes so great that con-
siderable Q and q is radiated to be eagerly absorbed
by those bodies possessing only an average amount or
less of Q and q.
This emission of Q and q brings another interesting
and parallel item to light. It is a well known principle
of physics that when two lxxlies collide with great speed
charged particles are knocked out. Taking our for-
mula, with small d, and an appropriate k. F will be-
come large. Since acceleration is proportional to F,
and velocity is equal to acceleration x time, after a
while a charged particle may be knocked out, which
will, if given time, grow into a charged lxxly. The
particle is as likely to be positive as negative. Some-
times two, or even three are knocked out simultaneous-
ly. This causes great consternation inasmuch as it is
not exactly according to theory. These deviations
from the accepted theory are known respectively as
twins and triplets. P.E.
A university student, asked to compose a stanza of
verse including the words "analyze" and "anatomy",
almost died of the following effort:
My analyze over the ocean,
My analyze over the sea;
Oh, who will go over the ocean
And brick back my anatomy?

Tom Squift, the intrepid boy inventor, felt like
clutching his brow. As a matter of fact, he DID
do a little mental brow clutching. Tom also felt called
upon to utter, from time to time, a low groan, which
had in its timbre that intangeable something that boded
ill for his tormentors.
Tom, as the reader no doubt knows, is a quiet,
smiling chap who has a natural flair for matters of a
paradoxical and scientific nature. In this adventure he
has wandered away from his lalx&gt;ratory in the attic
of East Hall, and had fallen into foul play at the hands
of his arch enemies, Filthy K. McNasty and Sid Co-
caine. These two miscreants had captured Tom and
had sworn (something fierce) that they would hold
him a captive till he told the secret of the famous Squift
Non-skid Peanut-butter Sandwich.
And so here was poor Tom, lxmnd hand and foot
and thrown into a donjon-like hole somewhere in the
Chemistry Building, the stronghold of Filthy and his
toady.
The door opened and in strode the two bad chaps
themselves. After cutting the cruel bonds which
bound our hero, the villians tried to wheedle and
badger Tom's secret from him. But Tom's nimble
brain was forming a plan of escape.
When the bullies least suspected, Tom thrust a well
manicured hand into his pocket and drew forth an
old, rusty Stilson wrench, apparently of little or no
value. But ahh— at the touch of a hidden spring a
couple of pairs of wheels unfolded and rested on the
floor. Good old Tom sat down upon the thus im-
provised automobile and began to drive idly about the
prison. The two evil-doers watched, pop-eyed, for a
while then they began to rush at poor Tom, waving
axes and so on overhead. Just as it seemed inevitable
that the young inventor would be caught, he switched
on a powerful electric ray from his new mysterious
Electric Artichoke, which he always carried with him.
The ray, reaching out, caught and transfixed the at-
tackers and held them, screaming with pain and what-
not, till Tom, now working with lightning-like speed,
chopped down the door with an axe. At last—a clear
path to freedom.
Just before making good his escape Master Squift
turned and called to the hollering hellions, telling them
that next time they would leave him alone. Then
leaping once more to the controls of his powerful Stil-
son mount, the young inventor returned to his lab,
chuckling to himself over the discomfit of his enemies.
PI TAU PI SIGMA
Pi Tau Pi Sigma, national honorary signal corps
fraternity, held its spring initiation at the North Lake
Cottage of Professor Brier, on March 31. The initiates
were given some real Signal Corps work to do, includ-
ing the laying low of a large tree next to the cottage.
The slush also tested their shoes but none seemed to
stand the test, if the steaming of socks at the fireplace
was an example.
Captain C. A. Powell, gave the main talk of the eve-
ning at the banquet which took place at the Inverness
Country Club. It is to be regretted that this is the last
initiation banquet Captain Powell will attend. He
leaves in June to go to the Industrial College at
Washington and the boys will certainly miss his con-
genial manner and every ready kindly word.
The men initiated were Edward Chapin. '35E; Le-
land Coulter, '35E; Thomas Dooling, '35E; William
Marsh, '35E; Delwin Reisinger, '35E; George Servis,

SIGMA RHO TAU
The Stump Speakers Society will hold their regular
weekly meetings every Wednesday this semester at
the Union. Their program is divided—every other
Wednesday they will have some prominent men from
the campus, or outside. On their remaining Wednes-
days they will have various other activities of the
society.
Amongst these activities are "Board of Directors
Meetings" in which the society becomes the board of
directors of a firm, and discusses some problem in the
business world. They will also have Round Table Dis-
cussions, and contests. These contests will be in story
telling, debating, and impromptu speaking.
Outside their regular activities they hope to hold
three debates. One with Detroit City College, one with
Detroit Tech., and possibly one with Ohio State. Be-
sides these debates they will have the "Hall of Fame",
in which various well known engineers will be nominat-
ed for the "Hall of Fame" through speeches made by
members of the society.

By Wilbert Budd,'35E
The Michigan Union Opera is back! This brings
fond recollections to "old-timers," but for present
undergraduates it is shrouded with haze. The annual
all-male show is again a reality and again we prepare
to relax to the antics of an age old Michigan tradition.
The football team, or part of it, has been turning out
regularly for practice. This time, however, instead of
practicing blocking and tackling, the latest dance rou-
tines occupy their attention. They find it slightly dif-
ferent in their wigs, brassieres, silk stockings, and high-
heeled slippers from the customary helmets, shoulder
pads, and cleated shoes. As usual the co-eds are banned
from participation in the production. The closest they
can get is the front row in the orchestra. There was a
time when women were able to take part in the opera.
That was in the year 1917. most probably due to the
shortage of men on campus that year.
The Union Opera was discontinued in 1929 because
it was running into the 'red' and there has been no
opera since then with the exception of "Robin Hood,"
which supplemented it in 1931. Now that the depres-
sion is over and money begins to oose out from the old
sock, the Union executives are anticipating the re-
junivating of the opera "With Banners Flying." That
is the name of this year's opera, which has been written
by editors of student publications on the campus. The

college tone is present in this production as it was in
most of the operas with the exception of the few that
turned "professional" just before they were abandoned
in 1929. The music is being composed by Milton Peter-
son, a former Michigan student, who is also directing
the production. He wrote the music for "Tambourine"
in 1925 and "Front Page Stuff" in 1926. Since leaving
school he has been engaged in writing songs in Xew
York.
The well known series of operas originated in 1908
with a production called "Michigenda.'' This brought
in two thousand dollars for the Union. Since then
there have been many successful operas produced. The
most successful was "Cotton Stockings" in 1923 which
cleared thirty thousand dollars. Many of the operas
have gone on the road and have been a hit in some
of our larger cities.
Along with the revival of the opera will be the
reopening of Ann Arbor's famous opera house, the old
Whitney Theatre, which used to be one of the country's
well known opera centers. Many of the famous operas
had their previews in this house and all the Union
operas were played there, so it is only fitting to regain
the spirit of the opera with the same setting in which
it began. The Opera House was closed in 1929 when
the last Union Opera was finished and remained closed
until last year when it opened as a movie palace.
Between the days of April 24 to April 28, Ann
Arbor townsfolk and university students will again be
able to enjoy opera and again see the men wear the
skirts in Ann Arbor.

PORTALS OF I I AISM\4, - ...
Entrance to the East Engineering Building ...
the newest addition to the Engineering group


from the beginning
By Philip R. Ewald, '35E.

As you walk down the main corridor of the West
Engineering building, you may notice the class pictures
on the walls. If you are going north, you can ob-
serve how the classes I&gt;ecome smaller, and the years go
farther back, until you come to a frame showing some
young fellows in Civil War uniform. In the same
frame are the pictures of two men listed as members
of the class of 1860. They were the first Michigan en-
gineers. It would be interesting to know what our
school was like in those days when none of the present
buildings existed, and many of the branches of en-
gineering had not yet come into being.
Though it was not established as a separate school
until 1895, the Engineering department has a history
almost as long as the University itself, for in the
article authorizing the University in 1837, a chair was
designated in Civil Engineering and Drawing. This
was about as far as engineering went, however, until
1853, when Alexander Winchell was appointed Pro-
fessor of Physics and Civil Engineering. The reason
for the particular combination of the subjects was the
general lack of any more suitable subject to associate
with Civil. In those days it was hardly big enough to
stand alone.
Winchell, and his succesosr, W. G. Peck, were more
interested in the physics end of the combination, so it
wasn't until 1851, when DeVolson Wood, just out of
Rensselaer, came to Michigan, that engineering really
became an independent subject. At this time Civil
Engineering was the only branch given, with the de-
partment located in the south wing of University Hall.
The first two engineers graduated in 1860. making
Michigan the sixth school in the country to grant en-
gineering degrees. Two years later a course in Mili-
tary Engineering was established under the pressure of
the Civil War, but was abandoned with the close of
hostilities. In 1864, a course was started in Mining
Engineering, and a few degrees were granted. This
course was dropped upon the establishment of the
Michigan College of Mining and Technology at
Houghton. Another course was started in 1868, this
time Mechanical Engineering, but it too was dropped,
the subjects being merged with Civil Engineering and
leaving that course again the one and only.
The appointment of C. E. Greene, Harvard '62, in
1872 marked a new epoch in the history of the Engi-
neering school. He found himself associated with J.
B. Davis, '68E, and C. S. Denison, Vermont 70. These
three men and DeYolson Wood, whose names are on
the bronze plaques in the Engineering Arch, may be
considered as the pioneers of the present school. They
were a foresighted group. Denison recommending the
adaptation of a professor's house for engineering needs
thirty years before it was actually done, and Wood
advocating the establishment of a separate engineering
school twenty years before it came about. With the
exception of Wood, these men remained with the school
long enough to see their ideas realized.
1881 was another big year for the school. The
Mechanical course was reestablished with Mortimer E.
Cooley, Annapolis '78, as the first professor. In the
same year, the first exclusively engineering building
was erected. It could hardly Ix: called elaborate, having
IxJCIi built with the total sum of $2,500 given to Cooley
for the purpose. It was designed by Davis and equipped
for shopwork mostly with what junk could be picked
up around the University. Such things as a broken
down lathe found in the basement of University Hall
and a used 2 H. P. steam engine became part of the
laboratory equipment.
An account of the way the first shop class was con-
ducted might be of interest. Prof. Cooley now had
his shops, and was ready to start the first forge class,
(probably something like the one shown in the picture).
Not being a very proficient demonstrator on the anvil,
he wondered what to do with them. He then hit upon
the scheme of sending the class to the scrap box with
the instructions that each man should pick out a piece
of wrought iron, one of cast iron, and one of steel.
Failure was perfect, so Cooley had something to lecture
on for the rest of the period.
The first issue of the Technic came out in 1882. It
was published annually by the Engineering Society,
and was later to grow successively to a quarterly and
then a monthly. Since it never discontinued publica-
tion, it is the oldest engineering college student publica-
tion in existence, and is furthermore the oldest student
publication on the campus.

The Engineering Building acquired in 1891
A wood shop was added to the new building in 1883
by the simple expedient of moving an abandoned
campus carpenter shop against it. These buildings
served until 1885, when the Engineering Annex was
erected, and all shops moved into it. The Electrical
Engineering department, organized in 1889, had, how-
ever, its labs in the basement of the West Physics
building. Finally in 1891, the building shown in the
illustration was taken over by the school. It was by
no means new or well adapted to engineering needs,
having been built in 1841 and used successively as a
professor's residence and the Dental college labs. It
stood on the site of the present Clements Library.
1895 was a red letter year for the Engine school,
for then it became a separate college with C. E. Greene
as the first dean. The engineers, numbering 331 at
that time, were required to have only 120 hours and a
thesis to graduate in any one of the three courses
offered, Civil, Electrical and Mechanical. To these
courses, three years later Chemical Engineering was
added, and one year after that, a course in Marine
Engineering and Naval Architecture with II. C. Sadler.
Glasgow '93, as the first professor.
M. E. Cooley became dean in 1903, upon the death
of C. E. Greene, with J. B. Davis as his associate. By
the next year, the Engineering school had outgrown
its old quarters, and the West Engineering building
was constructed. It was only about half as long as
at present, with the naval tank extending considerably
beyond the north end. An addition was made in 1909
so that at a total cost of $400,000, the building stood as
it does today. In this same year. VV. 11. Butz succeeded
Davis as associate to Cooley. Just previous to this time,
three honorary engineering societies had been estab-
lished, Vulcans, the senior class honorary in 1904, and
Triangles, the junior class honorary, with Tatt Beta
Pi in 1906. 1917 saw the beginning of the Aero course,
and also considerable activity at the school by the gov-
ernment. There was but one other naval tank in the
country, so Michigan's came in for a good bit of ex-
perimental use during the war.
In 1920, enrollment in the school reached an all time
peak with 2,029 engineers registered. Two years later,
it fell to 1,669. A course in Geodesy was started in
this year, and at the same time, the department of
Engineering Research began. At this time, J. W. Pat-
terson succeeded W. H. Butz as associate to Dean
Cooley. 1922 also marked the opening of East Hall
to engineering classes. It was formerly the Tappan
school, but was condemned by the Department of Ed-
ucation, thereupon taken over by the University, re-
modeled, and used for classrooms ever since. In the
next year, the last of the present group of Engineering
buildings. East Engineering, was completed and
occupied.
The requirements for graduation had been raised to
130 hours and a thesis in 1927, but this did not daunt
the engineer's desire for knowledge, for next year, five
more courses were added: Physics, Math, and Indus-
trial Engineering combined with either Chemical, Me-
chanical, or Electrical Engineering. Dean Cooley
retired in this year, and was succeeded by H. C. Sadler.
The next year brought the addition of two more
courses, Engineering Mechanics and Engineering Law.
Finally in 1930, the last course, Transportation, was
added. J. W. Patterson died in this year, and was suc-
ceeded by A. H. Lovell as assistant dean. Around
this time, an engineering forensic society was founded
with the name of the Stump Speakers Club. Today
there are student branches in the Engineering College
of all the national Engineering societies. There is also
a chapter of Sigma Xi, the honorary research society,
as well as those honoraries mentioned previously.
The stopping point has been reached, for history does
not extend beyond today. However, we can take a
short glimpse into the future and see what will be
history tomorrow. There are plans of a building of
which East Engineering is but a unit, to extend across
Church street. West Engineering building will be built
around to form a complete quadrangle. We can visual-
ize the buildings; it is difficult to visualize the school as
a whole, but we can say with confidence that the En-
gineering College will continue to become bigger, and
finer, as it has always done, and to turn out America's
best engineers.

Chicago's World's Fair enters its second year
Chicago's brilliantly successful World's Fair, A
Century of Progress, is about to experience once more
the scintillations of a myriad of lights and colors, the
tramping of thousands of feet, and the tempting aroma
of the hot dog, for its gates are soon to swing open
for a second and final season. May 26 to September 1,
1934. It will embody all the lessons learned in a
season of highly prosperous running, and will present
most of the finer features of last year beside the vast
amount of new and worthwhile material gathered over
the winter.
The exposition this year will present a general
atmosphere of improvement and expansion over the
1933 season. Practically every one of last year's
exhibits which is to be shown this season has been
remodeled and enlarged to present its ideas better and
more fully, and in addition a considerable number of
entirely new exhibits will be presented. These changes
and additions will have entailed an expenditure of ap-
proximately $7.000,000 by the time the season opens.
Among the many new features will be the Ford
exhibit, representing in itself $1,500,000. Much of
the famous Ford museum at Dearborn will be trans-
planted to the exposition and there will be displayed,
together with a great deal of other material of histori-
cal and social interest. Among the great variety of
other subjects included in this exhibit will be some
of the work Ford has been doing with soy beans and
the enamel developed therefrom.
The court of the Hall of Science will be the scene
of continuous lecture demonstrations of modern scien-
tific wonders, simply explained for the layman but
scientifically informative to persons of scientific in-
terests. Accomodations will be provided for 10,000
spectators. This will be in addition to the popular
House of Magic, presented by one of the large elec-
trical organizations, which will be back again with a
completely new bag of tricks.
The latest in streamlined railroad equipment will
be shown, with probably two complete trains and
several individual coaches in the display. There will
also be an exhibit of Diesel-electric locomotives, in-
cluding one of the giants of the Rocky Mountain
service.
The popularity last year of the Belgian Village Iris
resulted in the construction of about a dozen similar
projects, representing most of the more picturesque
lands and periods of history. These villages will be
located on the site of the old Midway, most of the
buildings of the latter having been moved to North-
erly Island.
As a part of the pure science exhibit, the Fourth
Dimension and the Theory of Relativity will be pre-
sented for the edification of the spectator. Dr. Saul
Pollock will have a completely new set of his mathe-
matical models, complete with everything but knee
action. Most of the basic science displays in the Hall
of Science have been reorganized and enlarged. The
medical, biological, mineralogical, and social science
exhibits have also undergone a considerable revision
and expansion.
Then there are dozens and dozens of other attrac-
tions we could mention. For instance, the world's
largest fountain, nearly 850 feet in length, will be
erected in the north lagoon to add to the beauty of
the affair. A tribe of San Ildefanso Indians will
build adobe houses and there demonstrate their pot-
tery craft alongside the latest in automatic pottery
machinery. An enterprising petroleum concern will
stage a free circus, featuring "thirty-five fee-rocious,
man-eating lions and tigers, the largest assemblage of
mixed cats ever worked together in the same cage at
the same time." There will be a zoo of 2,500 animals
on the Midway; an 80-foot automobile containing in
its body a motion picture theater seating eighty per-
sons, in the Travel and Transport building; and a
radio-controlled launch cruising the lagoons without
the guiding hand of man aboard. The Agricultural
and Dairy exhibit will be greatly enlarged. There will
be a short-wave radio station which may be operated

so we could go on for volumes—or several pages any-
how—but the whole idea of what we are saying can be
expressed in three little words: "Bigger and Better."
It is not surprising that some doubt has been evi-
denced as to the possibilities of carrying the success
of the exposition into a second season. Officials of
the Fair admit that they announced this year's reopen-
ing with their fingers crossed, but they have uncrossed
them now. Chicago hotels report more reserva-
tions for the period of the Fair in March of this year
than in May of last year. Railroads, airlines, steam-
ship companies, and travel agencies also report far
greater interest this year than last. With a greatly
improved spectacle to present to the public, and a
greater interest on the part of that public, A Century
of Progress seems destined to live the second half of
its life in even greater glory than the first.
Stratosphere to
be Invaded
By Charles A. Duerr, '34E
Near dawn, on a morning in early June, somewhere
near the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, will
rise the largest free balloon ever built. Two and one-
third acres of cotton cloth will be required for the
mammoth bag which, when fully inflated, will contain
3,000,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas. At the moment
of take-off, with the gondola resting on the ground,
the top of the bag, only about one-thirteenth filled,
will be more than 300 feet above the earth, higher
than a 27-story office building. At an altitude of
approximately 60,000 feet the balloon will be fully
inflated and will be a sphere 180 feet in diameter,
large enough to enclose an 11-story cubical building.
This gigantic balloon, at present under construction
in the factory of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation
at Akron, Ohio, will be five times the size of that used
by Commander Settle and -Major Fordney in Novem-
ber, 1933, and three and a half times the size of the
Russian balloon which was used in the stratosphere
flight of September, 1933.
The flight is under the joint sponsorship of the
National Geographic Society and the U. S. Army Air
Corps. The National Geographic Society is the chief
contributor to the fund to meet the flight expenses
while the Army Air Corps is furnishing the personnel.
Major William E. Kepner, U. S. Army Air Corps,
one of the world's outstanding balloon pilots and
winner of both national and international balloon races
in 1928, will pilot the balloon. Captain Albert W.
Stevens, U. S. Army Air Corps, one of the foremost
aerial photographers of the world, will be the observer
and will have charge of the scientific instruments.
The ascent is being made solely in the interests of
science and is not of the nature of a "stunt" nor is
it an attempt to establish an altitude record for its
own sake. A great number of scientific instruments
(many of them heavy) will be carried aloft for the
purpose of obtaining additional data and hitherto un-
known information regarding conditions in the upper
regions of the stratosphere.
Records of the temperature and barometric pres-
sure will be taken periodically from the earth to the
"ceiling" of the flight. Only one such set of measure-
ments from earth to stratosphere on the same day has
ever been taken in America, and that by Captain Ste-
vens. Mercury-column barometers will be carried
inside the gondola but will be connected by tubes to
the outside air. The thermometers will be suspended
inside metal tubes held by brackets at a distance from
the gondola and shielded from any heat radiated from
the shell. The air will be circulated through the tubes
by small electric fans. The thermometers are of an
electric type, connected by wires to a dial or scale
indicator in the gondola. Tiny, automatically operated
cameras will take frequent pictures showing at each
exposure the thermometer and barometer scales and
a clock face.
Recording barographs of an aneroid type will be
mounted on the outside of the shell. A check on
barometer measurements of altitude will be made by
optical methods. A camera, with its focal length
accurately determined by the Bureau of Standards,
will be mounted in an air-tight ball-and-socket joint
in the bottom port-hole of the gondola. By subse-
quent map studies of the photographs of the earth
altitude tables may be compiled which will be much
more accurate than those now in use.
Inside the gondola, near the top, will be a half
dozen 7^-gallon evacuated spherical glass containers,
each connected to the outside air through a pipe fitted
with an air-tight stop-cock. Samples of air will be
taken at several high altitudes and later analyzed for
gas composition and relative humidity.
An instrument will be carried outside the shell for
the determination of the change in the electrical con-
dition of the atmosphere from the 5,000-foot level to
the flight "ceiling."
Valuable information regarding the cosmic rays will
l&gt;e gathered. Three electroscopes will be used to
measure the intensity and penetration of these rays
at various levels. One, unshielded, will measure the
intensity. The other two, shielded by lead in different
degrees, will measure the penetration.
Photographs of the solar spectrum will be taken and
the amount of solar radiation determined by means of
Page Six

ness will also be made.
Oblique photography for distance, and test of
actinic value of light, and secondary absorption by
the atmosphere will l&gt;e investigated.
A complete radio apparatus for receiving and trans-
mitting voice will be used to determine the effects of
altitude on radio transmission.
Observations will be made of wind directions and
velocities and data gathered which will be useful in
solving balloon navigation problems.
Other projects may be added if observing time will
lxrmit and satisfactory methods can be worked out.
If possible, equipment will be included for ascertain-
ing the presence of ozone at high levels. These deter-
minations must be made aloft since ozone is unstable
and will break down into ordinary oxygen if the
sample is brought to earth.
In order to maintain a normal atmosphere for the
crew, flasks of both liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen
will be carried and spilled from time to time.
The gondola will be an air-tight hollow ball of Dow
metal, 8J^ feet in diameter. The shell will be slightly
less than one-fifth of an inch in thickness and will be
internally braced with vertical tubular posts to main-
tain the globular shape against the stresses created by
the heavy load of instruments and ballast. In the
lower part will be a metal floor 60 inches in diameter.
Two large hatches will be located on opposite sides
of the globe just alx&gt;ve the equatorial line. Many
small observation port-holes with air-tight glass covers
will be provided in both upper and lower halves. The
entire inside of the gondola and the upper half of
the outside will be painted white. The lower half will
be black. The empty gondola will weigh only 750
pounds.
Alxmt 7,000 pounds of lead dust or small lead shot
will be used as ballast and may be discharged by
means of an air-lock through the bottom of the shell.
Batteries, radio equipment, oxygen apparatus, and
hatch covers may be used as ballast and thrown out
as the balloon descends. Probably 2,500 pounds of
the I&gt;allast will be retained throughout the flight to
be used as "landing ballast" and disposed of as the
balloon passes through the lower atmosphere and the
hydrogen loses its "superheat" and contracts. Land-
ing ballast is extremely important for the safety of
men and instruments in bringing the balloon gently
to earth.
The take-off will occur as early in June as weather
conditions will permit. It is necessary that there be
only slow air movement at the surface of the earth
and that there be freedom from clouds between the
earth and the stratosphere. The exact point of take-
off will be determined as a result of a study of June
weather records now being made by the U. S. Weather
Bureau. It is estimated that the balloon will drift
alxmt 600 miles to the east, southeast, or northeast

Comparative Sizes of Balloon at Take-off and at Altitude
during the flight. With the balloon rising near the
Rockies the landing should be made in open country
with little damage to the bag. If the flight in June
is successful and the bag can be salvaged in good
condition a second flight may be undertaken in Sep-
tember from the same locality and with the same
personnel for the purpose of checking the first obser-
vations under similar conditions.
A. S. M. E. DOINGS
"Steam, Its Generation and Use", a motion picture
loaned by the Babcock and Wilcox Boiler Mfg. Co.,
entertained the members of the A.S.M.E., March 29,
in the Natural Science Auditorium.
This film dealt with the manufacturing and the as-
sembling of steam boilers and the testing of certain
lx&gt;iler parts. These boilers were then pictured and de-
scribed in actual operation, particular emphasis given to
the functions of the more vital parts.
At a joint meeting of the A.S.M.E. and the Trans-
portation Club, April 23, 1934, Ab Jenkins, premier
automobile and motorcycle driver, presented talking
pictures of his record breaking run of 3000 miles in
25 hours and 30 minutes. Maintaining an average speed
of 118 miles an hour over the Salt Deserts of L'tah.
Jenkins broke 66 American and world records without
leaving the wheel during the run.
Following the pictures, Mr. Jenkins answered ques-
tions concerning his performance. Russel Howe, '25E,
who was largely responsible for the design and produc-
tion of the twelve cylinder motor used, answered
questions of technical nature.

of the Agent
By Prof. Waller C. Sadler
An increasing number of business transactions are
conducted through agencies. The agent is a most
convenient representative of large manufacturing con-
cerns, and in fact he facilitates business expansion into
distant markets. The normal relationship between
the principal and agent is contractual, and it is this
contract which protects the principal against officious
acts of the agent. However, a good agent may fre-
quently over-step his expressed powers in order to
meet an unusual situation. The legal aspects of these
unauthorized acts are the subjects of this paper.
There are many branches of the law which establish
that a person cannot do indirectly what he is unable to
do directly. This rule also applies to agency. In the
case of Weston vs. Estey, 22 Colo. 334, 45 P 367, it
developed that Fisher, cashier of the Bank of Lead-
ville, attempted a financial settlement of heavy loan
agreements by having his bank operate the defunct
mine until the loan was paid. The court held that this
unauthorized act of the agent was illegal, as a bank
should not jeopardize the security of its depositors in
this manner. In other words, it was an ultra vires act
in which the agent could not bind the principal.
There is an established rule that an undisclosed
principal can not ratify the unauthorized act of an
agent. This is apparently based upon protection to
the third l&gt;arty, for it would hardly be fair to have
a wandering agent bind strangers to such an uncertain
contract. The court probably had this reason for the
rule in mind in deciding (ioldschmidt &amp; Co. vs. \\ sig-
ner, 99 S.W. 737. In that case, the agent was selling
an "automatic salesman machine," and misrepresented
the' identity of the prin-
cipal to the buyer. But
the court held that the
buyer in fact knew the
true identity of the prin-
cipal, and so no harm
was done by the unau-
thorized act of the agent.
The decision seemed par-
ticularly fair in view of
the fact that the principal
enjoyed the benefits of
the sale.

It is reasonable that a principal should have a full
knowledge if he is to be bound by his ratification of
the unauthorized act of his agent. In the case of
Miller vs. Sacramento Board of Education, 44 Cal.
166, an agent of Miller paid Miller's lumber bill.
Miller ratified the unauthorized act of the agent,
believing that the bill was only for lumber furnished
on a public school. In reality the bill covered all
unpaid lumber for several different jobs, and Miller
was not bound by his ratification. This decision is
quite consistent with the requirement of mutuality in
contracts. The requirement of mutuality also applies
where the principal tries to ratify part of the unau-
thorized act of the agent and reject part. Thus in
Loomis Milling Co. vs. Vawter, 8 Kans. a. 437, 57
P. 43, the agent sold flour, promising certain unau-
thorized warranties as to the quality of the flour. The
principal ratified the sale but rejected part of the
warranties. The court correctly held that such a rati-
fication was a distinct injustice to the buyer on the
basis of mutuality.
There are a few cases where a lack of knowledge
is no defense against a prior ratification. Thus in
Pope vs. J. K. Armsby Co.. Ill Cal. 159. 43 P. 589,
an agent entered into an authorized contract for the
sale of apricots. The principal ratified the contract
without ever taking the bother to examine the details
of sale, and the court held that the negligence of the
principal would prevent the plea of lack of full knowl-
edge of the contract.
Apparently the real controversies arise where the
ratification is established on the basis of implication
only. These decisions are governed by the relative
equity of the parties in interest, founded upon sound
legal concepts. In Oregon Railway Company vs. Ore-
gon R. and N. Co., 28 Fed. 505, the issue turned on
a lease and use of a railroad. The lease was ratified
by the board of directors, without a quorum present.
In other words, no express ratification was present.
l!ut the court found ratification through "user," the
lessee using the railroad and paying rent for a term
of years.
The implication of ratification will turn on the
intent of the principal. It would seem, therefore, that
this ratification could be most informal, provided that
Page Eight

Dover vs. Pittsburg Oil Co., 143 Cal. 501, 77 P. 405,
the agent, acting without authority, hypothecated stock
of the principal. Upon learning of the transaction,
the principal remarked "that is all right," and the
court held there was full ratification.
The enjoyment of the benefits by the principal is
usually construed as ratification. In the case of Black
Lick Lumber Co. vs. Camp Construction Co. 60 S.E.
409, the superintendent ordered and used extensive
quantities of lumber for tunnel lining and bridges on
the construction of the Deepwater Railroad Co. Since
actual use was made of these supplies, and full enjoy-
ment was had by the principal, it was held that the
unauthorized act was duly ratified.
Freyburg Canal vs. Graham, 5 Me. 38, is a case
decided in May, 1827, which is considered good law
today. It appears that a committee of the owners of
the canal was interested in a vital controversy con-
cerning the construction and operation of their canal,
and they appointed a referee to decide the issues.
This action of the committee was entirely out and
beyond the authority of any such group of stock-

holders. Other stockholders and the
company officers appeared before
the referee and treated the proceed-
ings as fully legal. When the refer-
ee's decision went against these
company officers, the present litiga-
tion was instituted. It was claimed
that this committee lacked authority,
but the court held that responsible officials of the canal
company participated in the arbitration, and thereby
ratified the unauthorized act.
It is probable that the unauthorized acts of an
agent should lead to binding contracts, in order that
a principal's business may better avoid delays and
enjoy unrestricted expansion. Ratification by the prin-
cipal is entirely elective, the only restrictions being a
proper protection to all parties concerned. Where,
however, the unauthorized act of the agent has led to
conflicting interests between the principal and the third
party, it is logical that that one should suffer, who has
been most responsible for the resulting injury.

By Maurice Taylor, '37E
Few of the students hurrying by the old campus
clock, on their way to an eight or nine o'clock class,
or homeward bound to lunch, know that tucked away
in a corner, to the right and below the timepiece, is
located the Universtiy's amateur radio-telegraph sta-
tion. The student operators of the station, with the
receiver and transmitter tuned to the short wave band,
have often made contact with the four corners of the
earth, and during the history of the station, which dates
back to 1912, many interesting experiences have been
encountered.
Picture a lonely shack in the Arctic wastes of Green-
land; peer through a clouded frosty window and there
you will see in the corner of the cabin, bending over
his radio equipment, the operator of the University of
Michigan Greenland Expedition. Listen with him for
a moment and if you are familiar with the International
Morse code, the signals that you hear will soon tell you
that he is in direct communication with Ann Arbor.
Switch rapidly from those cold northern signals and
listen in on some others, which are equally as cold,
coming from the opposite end of the earth, this time
from Byrd's Anartic Expedition of 1929. Eavesdrop
once more, this time with the operator in the radio
shack in Little America, and again you will hear the
familiar W8AXZ coming in down there, indicating
that the station is another of this famous expedition's
links with home. It is interesting to note that the
student operators at our station were instrumental in
hooking together by means of radio both of these ex-
peditions to the cold regions at the opposite ends of
the earth. There is no doubt that another step in radio
history was made, since this was the first time that
an expedition to the South Pole could exchange notes
directly with one at the other extreme of our earth.
Throughout the duration of the expeditions the sta-
tion handled many hundreds of messages for them and
it was during a certain traffic schedule that an interest-
ing incident comes to light. Admiral Byrd had a mess-
age for Professor Ilobbs at the University here, but
interference between Little America and Ann Arbor
made communication impossible. However, conditions
between Greenland and the South Pole were better
and contact was soon established. The operator at
NX1XL (Greenland) had reported that conditions be-
tween there and Ann Arbor were much better, so the
message was given to him and shortly thereafter was
relayed to W8AXZ. The radiogram had traveled a
distance of some 17,000 miles in a very few minutes.
During its two decades of existence the station has

equipment has been altered from time to time to keep
up with the many changes in this comparatively new
science. A good picture of the rapid advance in radio
communication can be had by comparing the equipment
as it stands today with that in use at the station "way
back when."
From the crystal detector and single audion tube for
receiving and the huge noisy 15.000 watt spark trans-
mitter have evolved a modern AC short wave receiver
and 800 watt crystal-controlled tube transmitter. It
seems that as the receiver increased in size and power,
its efficiency has increased; on the other hand the
transmitter has shown a remarkable decrease in size
and power and its efficiency has been in the inverse
ratio. It is the individual parts of the two transmitters
that make the interesting comparison, although funda-
mentally their functions are the same.
The aerial tuning inductance that was used in the
old spark set was really an inductance. Each turn of
it measured two feet in diameter and there were
enough windings to make the coil stand four feet high.
Today's edition of the same inductance is just four
inches long and the copper tubing is wound in a coil
whose diameter is four inches. The condenser of the
old set was an ingenious contrivance. It was made of
a number of glass plates about three feet square, all
mounted on a rack. Around each plate was some copper
foil, which was connected to an individual switch. The
usefulness of these switches became apparent whenever
a plate broke or cracked due to too great a strain in
the dielectric, for all that had to be done to disconnect
this faulty plate was to throw this little switch and
put another one into the circuit.
The antenna system, the radiating part of the equip-
ment, has seen some changes too. In the old days the
station was located in the West Engineering Building,
in a room just to the right of the Arch, and the aerial
stretched all the way from this point on the top of the
chimney which stands today behind the R.O.T.C. ad-
ministrative offices. At that time the chimney was
much higher than it is at present and the aerial
stretched a distance of three hundred feet. The
antenna in use now is a doublet antenna and hangs be-
tween a turret on a corner of the Engineering Annex
and the clock tower. It is sixty-six feet long. A
curious relation was noted in the old days. It seemed
that the trees under the antenna on that part of the
campus flourished and grew much more rapidly than
the trees on the rest of the campus. Later it was
found that this was no mere accident. From con-
clusive experiments it has been found that all plant
life thrives much more rapidly in the presence of radio
frequency currents than it does ordinarily.
The power used today is but a fraction of that used
formerly. Every time the key was pressed in the old
spark transmitter, 15,000 watts of electricity were con-
sumed and the antenna meter showed a current of from
twelve to twenty amperes. With this large amount of
power pressed into service, record distsance of six to
seven hundred miles were worked on infrequent oc-
casions. Today when the same operation is gone
through, only eight hundred watts of power are put
to work, (almost one twenty-fifth of the power) and
with a showing on the antenna meter of one ampere
strong signals half way round the world are reported.
Ever since the students at the University became
actively interested in this new science of radio way back
in 1912, the station has been in almost continuous
operation except for a period during the war when all
private radio communication was prohibited. The sta-
tion, operated jointly by the Electrical Engineering De-
partment and the Signal Corps Unit of the R.O.T.C.,
serves two good purposes. It affords a means of radio
communication experiments for potential electrical
engineers and enables embryo Signal Corps officers to
have practical experience in actual radio telegraphy
work.
HIGHLIGHTS OF COMMERCIAL OPERATING
Maurice Taylor, '37E, entertained the members of
the University of Michigan Radio Club, Monday night,
April 2nd, in the Union. He recounted the experiences
he had encountered during three years at sea as a
radio operator on all types of vessels, from passenger,
mail boats, yachts and down to freighters and tugs.
Taylor enlivened his talk by telling of his adven-
tures while shark fishing—labor troubles and taxi-
drivers in Buenos Aires—in a fierce gale in the South-
ern Pacific—in the Southern Pacific islands and about
the history of Pitcairn Island where the mutineers of
the H.M.S. Bounty settled—of poisonous spiders in
tropical vegetation—while lost in an abandoned Chilean
nitrate mine—happenings and tales of the radio shack
on one of the crack West Indian passenger ships—and
the story of a radio operator who died at his key.
CUP DEFENDER TESTED
A scale model of the Rainbow, the America's Cup
defender for 1934, was tested in the University Naval
Tank three summers ago. This new Burgess design
sloop is at present under construction at Bristol, R.I.
The Rainbow is to be slightly larger than the Enter-
prise, the Cup Defender for 1931, though her sail area
will be about the same. She will be built of bronze
plates below the waterline and high tensile strength
steel above. Her equipment will include a duralumin
mast and a triangle boom, the design of which was
proved satisfactory on the Enterprise.

to Use of Safety Fuels
By A. Francis Klute, '35E
About fifty-eight years ago Dr. N. A. Otto built
and patented the first successful internal combustion
engine. This was the first engine to operate on a
gaseous fuel which was burned and expanded within
the same chamber. The Otto cy-
cle engines of today which are
installed in automobiles, airplanes
and boats are very refined replicas
of this crude prime-mover built
by Dr. Otto. At a recent meeting
of automotive engineers it was
stated that in view of the great
improvements in body lines and
general construction of the mod-
ern motor vehicles, that the spark
ignition engines must be radically
improved beyond their present
state of refinement.
Recently a series of investiga-
tions were begun, to discover the
practicality of replacing the car-
buretor fuel systems on spark
ignition engines, operating on
the Otto cycle, with fuel injection systems. At the
beginning of the tests it was believed that cheaper,
more economical and safer fuels could be utilized than
are now used. This prediction has been proven true
by several of the investigators. Some of the experi-
menters were C. F. Taylor, E. S. Taylor and G. L.
Williams of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology; and O. W. Schey and A. W. Young working
at the Langley Memorial Laboratory for the National
Advisory Committee of Aeronautics.
For the purpose of investigating the value of solid
injection fuel systems, standard size single cylinder,
four stroke-cycle and water cooled test engines were
used, with dimensions and auxiliary devices similar to
those of ordinary automobile power-units. The engines
were constructed to operate with carburetor or fuel
injection systems. The carburetor was usually included
in the testing apparatus to provide a basis of perform-
ance for that engine, for comparison with later fuel
injection test data. The fuel pump and nozzle of the
solid injection system were usually commercial products
of the type used on Diesel engines. The pump would
be driven from the engine crank shaft through reduc-
tion gears which permitted a variable phase of injec-

tion. Spring loaded injection valves were usually
placed in the cylinder head in order to admit atomized
fuel at high pressures, 800-2000 pounds per square
inch. However some of the tests were carried on with
the injection valve mounted on
the intake manifold, merely sup-
planting the carburetor in its us-
ual position. Other experiments
were conducted with the fine spray
of atomized fuel directed: against
the incoming air stream, at right
angles to the air stream and in
the direction of the air stream.
The position against the air
stream gave the most favorable
results for this method of attach-
ment; but in general this type of
installation did not give the un-
usual characteristics desired,
placing the injection value in the
cylinder head proving more prac-
tical. Various compression ratios
from 3.5 to 9 were obtained by
adjustable sylinder heads and by the use of different

some of the tests supercharging was used to increase
volumetric efficiency and to aid in scavenging the ex-
haust gases from the cylinder after each combustion
cvcle. The speeds of operation were within the range
of automobile and airplane engines, 1000 to 2500 R.P.M.
The intake and exhaust valves on these test engines
were designed rather large or in pairs. Very .favorable
volumetric conditions were obtained by combining large
valve overlap, about 130J of crankshaft rotation, with
supercharging to rid the clearance volume of residual
products of combustion.
The tests themselves were conducted with all scien-
tific fairness to fuels involved. First ordinary gasoline
was used both for carburetion and injection. Injection
of gasoline directly into the cylinder showed a marked
increase in lx&gt;wer, over 10% and considerable decrease
in specific fuel consumption. It was suggested that
these improvements in performance with ordinary
motor fuel were due to stratification of the charge to
produce a good mixture at the spark plug. Stratification
is that phenomenon within an engine's combustion
chamber when by natural or mechanical means the
combustible charge is divided into strata or layers of
different mixture ratios of fuel vapor and air. The
reduction of the volume which must pass the inlet
valve, thus obtained greater volumetric efficiency, and
more accurate metering of the fuel and distribution of
the air-fuel mixture also explains this unusual per-
formance. Then a type of furnace oil used for Diesel
engine fuel was injected for a series of runs. Consider-
able difficulty was encountered with this low volatility
fuel on account of its tendency to detonate above com-
pression ratios of 4—4.5 but in spite of this troublesome
characteristic, due to the low flash point of the fuel, a
still lower specific fuel consumption was obtained show-

comparatively low cost of furnace oil. Early experi-
ing a very great increase in economy on account of the
menters suggested treating this type of fuel with some
anti-knock agent; but this made the price of the fuel
impractical if enough "dope" were added to take ad-
vantage of the higher compression ratios desired. The
petroleum industry has made this unnecessary through
its development of hydrogenated or "safety" fuels, as
they are called.
A safety fuel, by definition, is a hydrocarbon fuel
whose flash point, or the lowest temperature at which
it burns, is above 105° F., the flash point of kerosene.
The high flashpoint fuel can be obtained by controlling
the initial distillation range of the fuel; but the high-
octane-namber, above 85, required of such fuel for use
in a high compression spark-ignition engine can only
be obtained by definite changes in the structure of the
comlx&gt;site molecules which make up the fuel. The
hydrogenation process accomplishes this change of
structure by treatment of the fuel at high temperatures
and pressures with free hydrogen. Hydrogenated fuel
is particularly adaptive to solid injection equipment in-
stalled on otherwise normal spark ignition engines.
Some trouble is encountered when ordinary carburetion
practice is attempted with this fuel. Some source of
heat must be provided at the carburetor and separate
distribution for each cylinder involved must be main-
tained to obtain satisfactory operation.
When using hydrogenated safety fuels on the test
engines a remarkable increase in power and lower spe-
cific fuel consumptions were obtained in comparison
with those tests where high grade aviation gasolines
were injected with the same equipment. By increasing
the compression ratio on one engine using safety fuel,
from 5.85 to 7.0 at no boost in pressure (i.e. without
supercharging) gave an increase in power output of 8%
and a decrease in specific consumption of 13%. These
were accompanied by large increases in maximum brake
mean effective pressures, 10-12 pounds per square inch
over that at the lower compression ratio- These results
were improved still more by increasing the compres-
sion ratio and using boost pressures of from 2-10
inches of mercury by means of supercharging. One
universal test engine was operated successfully with-
out supercharging with a compression ratio as high
as 9.0 without any trouble being encountered due to
detonation.
The highest useful compression ratio for the injec-
tion of a hydrogenated fuel into an engine can be
considerably increased by suppressing detonation by
mechanical means. By various adjustments of phase re-
lation between ignition and injection the desired results
for any given engine may be obtained. One group of
investigators at the M.I.T. found that retarded fuel in-
jection gave some increase in power when used with
higher compression ratios and believed this increase
to be due to increased stratification; but this group
found that by retarding the spark offered a distinct
Page Twelve

detonation by retarded injection. It was found how-
ever that greater economy at higher compression ratios
was obtained with retarded fuel injection due to bet-
ter conditions favorable to complete combustion.
The one difficulty which is giving the investigators
some trouble in the application of this process of solid
injection of low volitility, high octane rating safety fuel
oil is in starting the engine when cold and operating
the egine at idling speeds. This is a difficulty which
must be remedied before the practical application of
this system to automobile, airplane and boat engines
can be accomplished. Several means have been success-
fully used: first, using gasoline as a starting fuel in an
auxiliary carburetor or injected directly into the en-
gine cylinder; second, heating a small quantity of
safety fuel to its vaporization temperature by means
of a little electric coil and then injecting into the cylin-
der; third, mixing gasoline with starting air on engines
equipped with compressed air starters for airplanes.
This auxiliary supply of gasoline would be very small
and would present no more trouble than is now en-
countered with starting systems on high compression
engines.
On an engine of this type for commercial use, a very
complicated air-fuel control system has to be worked
out in order to provide proper mixture ratios at all
speeds. However this problem is much simpler than this
same problem in the operation of Diesel engines at
variable speeds. It has been suggested that for aircraft
use of this kind of spark-ignition engine the air throttle
and fuel quantity control should be interconnected by
means of a linkage thus insuring constant predeter-
mined proportios of fuel to air for different loads and
speeds. This would probably be the best solution for
automotive use to make the engine fool proof in this
respect-
Investigators and commentators on this subject
agree that this system has practical value for applica-
tion to the small high speed Otto cycle engines used
to motivate vehicles. The concensus of opinion seems
to be with the use of injection for heavy fuel oils and
hydrogenated safety fuels, although there are some in-
duction systems using special heated carburetors which
are successfully using this low volatility type of fuel
in commercial engines. But they believe that there is
much need for further investigation on stratification
within the cylinder before combustion occurs, suppres-
sion of detonation by retardation of ignition and injec-
tion and improving molecular properties of heavy oils
to give higher anti-knock characteristics to take ad-
vantage of greater compression ratios. One research
engineer boldly states that in 1935 we shall see wide
use of hydrogenated fuel in spark ignition engines by
this method of fuel injection.

OSCILLATOR DETECTOR FOR METAL TESTING
A new vacuum tube oscillator to detect flaws and
cracks in copper tubing, tungsten or molybdenum wire
and similar materials has recently been developed which
promises to make more accurate the testing of such
products to eliminate faults. The instrument detects
local flaws and sudden changes in characteristics by
means of eddy currents induced in the material in-
spected-
The instrument is based upon the change in electrical
resistance of a small section of tubing or wire which
occurs when a defect is in the section. Eddy currents
are induced in a section of the material in question by
passing it through a coil connected with an oscillator
circuit. Two such oscillators are joined together and con-
nected with an amplifier to a loudspeaker and a meter.
Each oscillator has two coils, either or both of which may
be used as test coils through which to pass the tubing.
When a good section of the material to be tested
is in the coils the oscillators are both tuned to the same
frequency. As the tubing or wire passes through the
coils, a flaw will change the induced current enough to
change the frequency of one of the oscillators, caus-
ing a beat note in the loudspeaker and a deflection on
the meter. By using one test coil alone it is possible to
detect gradual changes in characteristics, or to com-
pare the specimen with a given standard.
ELECTRICITY PRODUCED FROM WIND
In the Balaklawa region of the Crimea, where there
are always constant prevailing winds, the Russians have
built a 100,000 watt power plant operated by wind
power, The unit consists of a high-speed wind motor
rated at 180 h.p. and a synchronous 100 kw. generator,
both mounted in a structural steel tower about 75 feet
high. For the safety of the experimenters, generator
voltage was only 220. The three phase current is car-
ried in cables to an adjacent power house where it is
stepped up to 6300 volts for transmission. The unit
supplies energy in series with a steam turbine plant
to the power lines and has been in successful opera-
tion for more than a year.
The wind wheel has blades approximately 35 feet
long which are of the self-regulating variable pitch
type. A series of weights inside the blades are resisted
by springs in such a way that a change in the rate of
rotation moves the weights and changes the position of
an aeleron fixed on the trailing edge of each blade as
on an airplane wing. Changing the position of the
aeleron causes the effective pitch of the blade to change
to an angle which compensates for the change in speed.
In this way a constant rate of rotation is provided,
even though the wind velocity changes.
The shaft of the wind wheel and the generator are
connected by gears, and are at an angle of 12 degrees
with the horizontal, so a pivot bearing is used in addi-
tion to the regular bearing which allows the unit to
swing into the wind. Power for this operation is ob-
tained from a 1.5 h.p. A.C. motor.
The generator is rated at 220 volts, 600 syn. r.p.m.,
and with a power factor of 84%. The rotor is phase
wound and, to prevent the generator from being over-
loaded, has a motor-controlled reostat slip-regulator in
its circuit which is actuated by a current transformer
in the output circuit.
When the unit arrives at synchronous speed the gen-
erator is automatically cut in, and after the wind dies
it is automatically cut out until it rises again to syn-
chronous speed. All automatic equipment and relays
are operated on 220 volts A.C., thus eliminating D.C.
and battery circuits. This auxiliary power is supplied
by a house transformer. Phase synchronization is not
necessary before the unit is cut in, but only a speed
roughly that of synchronism, so a centrifugal mechan-
ism is used to open or close the circuit of a solenoid-
operated circuit breaker connecting the generator to the
output low-voltage side of the transformer.
BALL BEARING INSTALLATION SIMPLIFIED
Installation of industrial ball bearing units has been
greatly simplified by development of a new type known
as the flange cartridge unit. The unit has proved
especially advantageous on sloping conveyers where it
replaces the conventional pillow blocks, which require
built-up shelf angles for mounting. By eliminating
these shelf angles considerable structural steel work is
eliminated and installation time is reduced.
The conveyer roll shaft extends through the steel
channel web and the cartridge is bolted in place over the
shaft- This gives more than usual rigidity because the
web is stronger than the channel flange on which pillow
blocks are mounted. The cartridge is self-aligning, so
the bearings do not have to be aligned with much accu-
racy, and vibrations due to lack of rigidity in the frame
do not affect the bearing because provision for mis-
alignment is provided in a self-locking collar.

Announcement has recently been made of a new,
high voltage large capacity, oil circuit breaker which
is radically different in design from those previously
in use. Each single-pole unit is shaped like a cross in
contrast with the tanklike construction of conventional
equipment. Higher breaking speeds with short arcing
times and the use of very little oil are among the ad-
vantages of the new design. Only 96 gallons of oil
per pole are required by a breaker with an interrupt-
ing capacity of 1,500.000 kv-a. at 138 kv.. compared
with approximately 1700 gallons per pole for a con-
ventional breaker of an equivalent interrupting rating.
Horizontal containers, not much larger than bush-
ings on the conventional breakers, enclose the inter-
rupting mechanisms. These elements consist of several
sets of contacts in a line, so arranged that oil, driven
by a piston, is forced across the arc path of each of the
arc breaks during circuit interruption. The horizontal
containers are mounted on a vertical central support,
which in addition to serving in an insulating capacity
also houses current transformers when such equipment
is required.
PHOTO-ELECTRIC CELL PREVENTS FLASHOVER
Among the many practical uses to which photo-
electric cells have been put in the last few years, one
of the most useful is a cell designed to prevent flash-
overs on commutators in power plant generators, thus
saving costly repairs and cutting down the time that
equipment is out of service.
The photo-electric cell is mounted inside a well-
protected box, and placed in such a position that the
slightest flashover on the commutator enters the cell
and causes it to actuate relays which in turn open the
main power circuit to the machine. Thus the instant a
flashover occurs the generator is cut off until an inspec-
tion is made to correct the fault. The device is so
rapid and sensitive that it acts to suppress the flashover
before it is visible to the eye and before it has a chance
to damage the generator.
LAMP BULBS AS AIR-SAMPLING CONTAINERS
When Captain Albert W. Stevens, noted U.S. Army
aerial photographer whose photographing of Mt. Shas-
ta, Wash., from a distance of 331 miles made camera
history, ascends into the stratosphere in June he will
take with him several novel air-sampling containers.
The containers will consist of specially constructed
lamp bulbs of the ten-killowatt size, equipped with
valves for the intake and exhaustion of the stratosphere
air, and will probably also be equipped with pressure-
recording gauges.
Lamp bulbs appear to be the logical choice for such
air-sampling containers, since for many years "they
have served perfectly for holding rare gases such as
are used in incandescent lamp manufacture. The bulbs
will have been evacuated, then sealed at the bi-post
prongs, where the intake and exhaust valves will I&gt;e
located.
FOG NAVIGATING CAMERA PERFECTED
A camera utilizing the infra-red rays to record fog-
hidden objects has recently been placed on the bridge
of the liner S. S. Manhattan as part of the ship's
standard safety equipment. By fast development of
the exposed films it is possible for the ship's officers to
know definitely what is ahead, no matter how dense the
fog. In tests the camera recorded objects more than
Y\ mile away, while visibility with the naked eye was
less than 400 feet. The camera is expected to materially
reduce the risks of fog at sea and to reduce delays
formerly caused by fogs.
The camera, designed by Capt. K. M. Williams,
U.S.N.R., is a long box mounted on a tripod so that
it can be sighted in any direction, and the relative
bearing of the picture taken can then be read from a
graduated azimuth circle on the top of the tripod. The
box consists of a lens, a shutter arrangement, a holder
for the infra-red sensitive film, and a developing and
fixing compartment.
The film is a continuous strip coated with a special
infra-red emulsion, and it is exposed through an apo-
chromic color-corrected lens between the elements of
which is inserted an infra-red ray filter.
After exposure the film is immersed in a concen-
trated developing bath for 30 seconds. It is then auto-
matically moved from the developing bath to the fixing
bath of "hypo". As soon as the film is in the "hypo"
it is visible to the operator, so he sees the picture only
30 seconds after it was taken. The operation of the
camera can be continuous like a movie camera for
crowded harbors, or it can be adjusted to make an
exposure at given intervals.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


STANLEY C. KILLIAN
Stan Killian, managing editor of the Michigan Tcch-
nic for 1933-34, got his start in Chicago, the home of
needled beer and Al Capone. Then came the Univer-
sity of Michigan and Stan tried out for the track team,
having won his letter in this sport in high school, but
German got the best of him. We, the writers of this
article, often wonder, as probably did Stan, why the
Allies, at the end of the World War, did not make
it punishable with in-
stant death ever to
learn German. Stan,
though, was not en-
tirely downhearted,
for he joined Sigma
Rho Tau and later
went out for fresh-
man basel&gt;all.
In his sophomore
year, Stan was made
the publication editor
of the M i c h i g a n
Technic. As a mem-
ber of Sigma Rho
Tau, he debated
against Michigan
State College and the
University of Detroit.
Being a popular man,
he was also elected to
Triangles.
Stan, an R.O.T.C. student, was made a member of
Pi Tau Pi Sigma, honorary Signal Corps society, in
his junior year. That was his red letter year. He was
made managing editor of the Michigan Technic. was
elected to Vulcans, and became a member of Tau Beta
Pi. Stan served on the Slide Rule Ball committee,
then, because he claimed that he once knew how to
play the piano. Besides all this, he struggled along
with twenty-one hours each semester.
Notwithstanding his work as managing editor, Stan
was elected chairman of the Slide Rule Ball this spring.
As a cadet captain in the R.O.T.C., Stan served on the
Military Ball committee. He is a member of the En-
gineering Council, also. Engineering physics, with
electronics predominating, has been the classroom work
of his Senior year.
Now, his outstanding extra-curricular activity is stop-
ping in at Helen Newberry. As they say when referring
to a magnetic field, the attraction is directly proportion-
ate to a pair of blue eyes.

STANLEY C. KILLIAN
STEINAR VAKSDAL
Steinar Vaksdale, the up and coming mechanical
and industrial engineer, like the famed biblical charac-
ter, first saw the light of day on Christmas morn. In-
stead of being born in a stable, though, Steinar was
born in Chicago.
Corning, New York, "The Crystal City'', the home
of the famous glass works, was our hero's next home.
There, in high school, he was the manager of the base-
ball team and the hero
of the senior play. He
received two medals
upon graduating, one
for having the high-
est scholastic average
among the boys grad-
uating and the other
for being neither
tardy nor absent for
six years. With this
for a handicap, Stein-
ar entered the good
ol' University of
Michigan to do or
die.
Time marches on!
In his sophomore
year, Steinar was on
the engineering jack-
e t committee. Last
year he was on the Executive Council of the Michigan
Union, and the humor editor of the Michigan Technic.
For the past two years, Steinar has been the secretary
and the treasurer of the Engineering Honor Council.
This year, Steinar was on the music committee for
the Slide Rule Ball, and is a member of the executive
committee for the senior class. For this coming year,
the Triangle fraternity, knowing the personal mag-
netism that is a part of Steinar's character, has con-
sented to let him be president. Steinar is also a mem-
ber of the Vulcans and Triangles.
As the editor of the Michigan Technic for the year
1933-34, Steinar made the lxiys who help run the mag-
azine toe the mark. "Meet the deadlines or meet me" was
his motto. Being over six feet tall, this battle cry of
his, in the vernacular, brought home the bacon. Broth-
er engineers, this serves as an example to show what
a little spunk and grit will do for one.
His hobbies are camping and blind dates. In his
own words, he is not essentially a man with the women
and co-eds; nevertheless, he gets around a bit.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The school year is almost over. The Vulcans have
lieen vulcanized, the Triangles triangulated; the fourth
Spring Homecoming has been pronounced a success;
the Union Opera has !ieen revived, to stay, we hope.
All in all, as we look backward the year has been an
improvement over the year previous. Students are be-
ginning to awaken and take an interest in things about
them. An answer has come to the long-felt need of a
unifying body.
Engineering Council Constitution Revised
In order to make the Engineering Council a group
truly representing the students, its constitution was
changed so as to include a representative from every
student organization in the College, besides a man from
each class. It also provides that the council promote
the interests of the students, social and otherwise. A
faculty member is to be chosen, and the council will act
as a liaison body between students and faculty.
Dean Sadler Enthusiastic
Dean H. C. Sadler, and Prof. H. C. Anderson, both
of whom have approved the changes, are heartily in
accord with the principles of the new council, which
they feel is a necessary Ix&gt;dy. With its new member-
ship, it is the ideal group for the transfer of ideas be-
tween faculty and students. Delegates for the council
are being elected at the same time as the officers of the
various organizations. These men, chosen for their
interest in student affairs, will form a fine group. How-
ever, they cannot work alone. It will require the sup-
port of every student to make the council a success.
The Michigan Teclinic pledges its whole-hearted co-
operation.
Council Already Functioning
Immediately the constitution was adopted, the coun-
cil, acting on the suggestion of Bob Thorne, '35E, ap-
pointed a committee to work on "Dad's Day" and Open
House in connection with Spring Homecoming. The
committee did a fine job, and is to be congratulated.
Besides Thorne, members were: Nicholson, Campbell,
Hazelton, Wagner, Marsh and Hillier.
Engineering Smoker Next
The Engineering Smoker, an annual affair, is set for
May 23, with Mr. Wm. B. Stout of Detroit, prominent
designer and builder of aircraft, as the principal speaker.
Refreshments will be served, an orchestra will be pres-
ent, and other entertainment will be provided. Every
engineer should attend this event—see you there! Let's
giv the new council a good send-off.
Outlook Brighter
Things are looking brighter on every side. Early
indications predict a larger enrollment in the fall, and
a better chance of employment for the June graduates.
Leland, Michelson, Roe, Kohl and H. Hesler have been
chosen by General Electric to take positions in its school.
M. Bates is going to M. I. T. on a Phi Kappa Phi Fel-
lowship. A number of others graduating have good
prospects, and we who will finish in a year or two are
much encouraged.
A Bit of Advice
We would like to reiterate a few statements from an
editorial entitled "Shoe Leather vs. Brains" which ap-
peared in the Dec. '32 issue. "The first mistake that
most job hunters make—both those who have no jobs
and those who seek a change of job—is to use their shoe
leather instead of their brains." The editorial, written
by Jerry Gruitch, '33E, stresses the need for an analysis
of the seener's ability and of the employers who might
use that ability. After that, a letter should be written,
seeking an interview, stating qualifications of the appli-
cant.
Appointment Bureau a Big Help
Jerry, who is now in the Research Dept. of Chrysler
Motors, adds that the blanks provided by the Univer-
sity Bureau of Appointments and Occupational Infor-
mation proved invaluable to him. These blanks furnish
very complete information to a prospective employer
and, in his case, led to three interviews in a week.
May we remind you—fill out a blank!
Are Extra-Curricular Activities a Help?
That is a question often asked. Just recently Dean
Bursley, speaking a Vulcans initiation banquet, pointed
out that the two purposes in coming to college are to
get book-knowledge and to learn to enjoy life after
college. He suggested extra-curricular activities and
cultural courses to accomplish the second end. Prof.
H. C. Anderson also feels that the experience and asso-
ciations gained from participation in student affairs are
imlxirtant. These contacts prove of great help to the
student when be enters the outside world, in his opinion.
A Pleasant Duty to Perform
We just must stop here to congratulate the Michigan
Alumnus staff. Besides publishing the bi-weekly
Alumnus, the Quarterly Review, a long felt need has
made its first appearance. The first issue took first
place in its class for that type of publication, in a recent
contest.
Congratulations!

Marine Journal
Last month, kind reader, we showed you a picture
of a salesman demonstrating a one goat-power drive
to Brother Noah for his ark. Here we have the same
man pointing out the features of a new type of turbine
drive. Something seems to have gone wrong, however,
and the cameraman just happened to be on hand at
the big moment. The boy with the bellows had evi-
dently bolted too many of his M.E. 3, M.E. 9, or Ch.E.
10 classes and didn't know beans about combustion and
boilers. Anyway he's leaned a little too heavily on
those bellows and succeeded in taking the whole busi-
ness apart a helluva lot quicker than it was put together.
The salesman's up that well-known creek now, and a
paddle wouldn't do him any good, either. There's
nothing in that book of instructions he's holding that'll
help him put over a sale now.
PLAINT OF THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEER
A Laurel wreath to IRVIN SATTINGER, poet laure-
ate of the engine school, for the following contribution:
Any engineering student must be feeling quite im-
prudent
When he chooses the electrical department of his
school.
If he knew what he must carry in his mind, he'd be
more wary
Of attacking such a subject and of learning every rule.
Just to prove themselves our betters, the professors tag
with letters
Sixteen hundred different concepts and give every one
a name.
Then they set the students wading through the mess
to learn the shading
Of these terms so they'll discover why there are no
two the same.
There's resistance and reluctance and susceptance and
inductance
And a score of nouns to designate electromotive force.
STRESSES
AND
STRAINS
There is armature reaction, there's electrical attraction
And a host of other quantities from no apparent
source.
You will take a d.c. circuit and you'll figure how to
work it
Underneath the supervision of Professors Bull and
Stout.
Next Professor Higbie's waiting when you switch to
alternating
And he'll throw you sines and cosines till you know
them inside out.
With Professor Moore prepare to do some work you
might not care to;
He will keep you busy drawing and interpolating
curves.
You'll design the field and rotor of a complicated motor
Not just once but two or three times till it irritates
your nerves.
And Professors Gault and Bailey will preoccupy you
daily
With profound considerations of the synchronous
machines.
You will work with volts and amperes and with oscil-
lation dampers
Till the theory is perfected and the reasons clearly
seen.
This is anything but gentle and the worst effects are
mental;
It's apparent in your actions and reflected in your
voice.
For this engineering calling can induce a quite appalling
State of psychical decrepitude which may not come by
choice-
But by gar! As I'm a poet, when you're through the
course you know it:
You can do the problems blindfold and with both
hands tied behind.
With a very few concessions, it's the finest of pro-
fessions
For it elevates the spirit and it cultivates the mind.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The University of Michigan regiment, Reserve
Officers Training Corps, stands to lose two and possibly
three members of its staff of instructors by transfers.
Captain Carroll A. Powell and Captain Robert H. Lord
have received definite orders, and Captain Arthur B.
Custis expects his every day.
Captain Powell to Washington
Captain Powell, who has been in charge of the Signal
Corps for five years, has been ordered to Washington,
where he will change his role from teacher to student
when he enters the Army Industrial College on Sep-
tember first. Here he will be near Major Basil Ed-
wards, for four years head of the department here,
who is now in the office of the Assistant Secretary of
War, in charge of the Army Industrial College and
Industrial Mobilization.
"Cappy," as he is familiarly known to seniors in the
Signal Corps, has had a varied career since being com-
missioned in 1917. Originally a Cavalry man, he
went into the Field Artillery for his eleven months in
France. Because he was an Electrical Engineer, he
was transferred to the Signal Corps and sent to Yale,
where he received his master's degree in Electrical
Engineering. His undergraduate work was done at the
University of Cincinnati. From Vale he went to the
Signal School at Fort Monmouth, then to the office of
the Purchasing and Contracting Officer of the Signal
Corps in New York city. After four years there he
was sent to Michigan. Under his guidance the Signal
Corps has grown by leaps and bounds. His loss will
be deeply felt by the students some of whom will be
fortunate to be in camp with him this summer.
Captain Lord Also Assigned to Washington
Captain Lord, a graduate of Ohio Wesleyan Univer-
sity, was commissioned in August of 1917. Previous
to his coming here he was on duty with the 78th division
in New Jersey. In 1928 he was graduated from the
Infantry school at Fort Benning, Georgia, and was
assigned to the University of Michigan in July of that
year. Ann Arbor has been his permanent station since
that time although he has been on temporary assign-
ments elsewhere.
Captain Lord has had active charge of the drill of
the entire unit, besides handling the Infantry courses.
With the help of Lieutenant Richard R. Coursey, he has
formed a well drilled outfit and a fine set of embryo
officers who stepped right in when the unit was changed
from a battalion to a regiment. His help has been in-
valuable in the hardest of training, the handling of
men. Because of his work he has made the acquaintance
of every man in the unit and is liked and respected by
all. The high standing of the regiment is due to his
efforts.
In Washington he is to be assistant to the executive
officer, National board for the promotion of rifle prac-
tice.
Captain Custis Awaits Orders
Captain Custis, for the last five years in charge of
the Ordinance instruction here, is expecting any day to
receive an assignment to a new post. Like Captain
Powell and Captain Lord, he also was commissioned in

At the close of the war he participated in the Inter-
Allied horse show ; was Chief of Apache Scouts in 1920
and 1931; spent seven years in the Cavalry; attended
the Air Corps school in Texas. Before coming here he
was in charge of the instrument shop of Frankfort
Arsenal for three years.
Known as a "square shooter" by his students, Cap-

rifle teams. Because of his riding ability, he is often
called upon to judge riding events. His hobby, as

becomes an Ordinance officer, is collecting old guns, of
which he has quite an assortment.
No one, especially himself, knows what his next
assignment will be, so he is prepared for anything. His
past experiences have given him a smattering of all
branches of the service.
To say that the loss of these men will be deeply felt
is putting it mildly. Each of them, through his actions
in the classroom and his personality, has endeared him-
self to the students. They, with their wives, have taken
an active part in campus life, and they are well liked by
the faculty. No Scabbard and Blade function is com-
plete without them. Their popularity is attested by the
fact that they are in demand as chaperons for campus
parties.
It will take three good men to fill their places, but
we feel that with Col. F. C. Rogers, in charge of the unit,
and Lt. Coursey, who both "carry on," the pace of ad-
vancement will not slacken. Col. Rogers, under whose
leadership the battalion became a regiment, is respected
and admired by the students. A real military man, he
instills the quality of leadership in the men under him.
As instructor of all basic students, Lt. Coursey, the
youngest member of the staff both in age and point of
service, offers capable assistance in all the units activ-
ities. The Varsity—R. O. T. C. band has attained its
distinction through his efforts.

STREAMLINED MOTOR
The new automobiles and airplanes have nothing,
as far as streamlining goes, on an electric motor
recently manufactured by General Electric. And
undoubtedly many visitors to Langley Field, in
\ irginia, where the motor is now located, will
think it some kind of miniature "Zeppelin." The
motor is being used in investigations of the noises
made by various types of propellers, the objective,
of course, being to design a propeller in which noise
is reduced to the practical minimum.
The motor, of the wound-rotor induction type, rated
at 200 horsepower, is probably the first of its kind
ever built. The propellers are mounted directly on
the motor shaft, and can be run at speeds of be-
tween 1000 and 3600 rpni. The noises are picked up
by a microphone and analyzed by means of special
measuring devices.
The motor was designed by C. J. Koch, M.I.T., '24,
aml M. 11. Wells, Syracuse, '02; and the control by
A. Suksdorf, Washington Slate, '16.
stomp, cat?

LESS NOISE
I'ntil recently, noise has been regarded as a neces-
sary evil, something that has come quite naturally
with higher speeds and more complex civilization.
Hut someone noticed that noise gives us the "jitters"';
rubber tires began to appear on milk wagons, and
rubber cushions on ash cans. So, when General
Electric was developing its air-conditioning units,
noise became an important factor. Propeller-type
fans, which had to run 21 hours a day to circulate air,
were used, and thev made too much noise for com-
fort. The Research Laboratory was given the job of
doing something about it.
Research scientists examined the blades and found
that on conventional fans all parts of the'blade did
not push air at the same rate of speed; in some cases,
in fact, some parts pulled air back instead of pushing
it forward. Blades on which every bit of surface
pushed air at approximately the same speed were
designed. And lo! not only was the efficiency of the
fan tremendously increased, but the fan was quiet.
Furthermore, a system was evolved whereby
accurate fan-noise rating is possible. As a result,
air-conditioning units which make no more noise
than is present in a closed room on a quiet day were
developed.
This quiet-fan development was done under the
direction of K. D. McMahan, Oklahoma A. &amp; M.,
'29, of the G-E Research Laboratory.

of electrical engineers, he would have been 69 years
old had he lived until April 9. From his 30 years of
work with General Electric came the mathematical
formulas involving alternating current, the dis-
covery of the laws of hysteresis, and methods of
protecting transmission lines from lightning damage.
These, to name a few, were basic aids in establishing
present-day standards of electric service.
Yet, the heritage left bv Sleinmetz is the memory of
not only a great scientist but of an essentially
charming, kindly, helpful man of wide interests.
Out of the past, on the night of April 7, his voice-
spoke to radio's thousands—a voice that lives on
a strip of film, evidence of our victory over lime.
Thus was inaugurated a three-day tribute to one
who was loved for his human qualities
as well as revered for his engineering
achievements. 96-53DH
